swinging price movement that pr ovides a perfect opportunity for swing trading .
Swing Traders  capit alize on the emot ions of others while they caref ully control their
own emot ions and systematically enter and exit trades.  Swing Traders recognize the
levels of support and resistance.  They understand the concepts of momentum and
volatility and can  identify a trading range or ch annel.

5 Pattern Recognition Criteria
While look ing at a chart can often tell you whether a st ock is appropriat e for swing
opportunities every day.  Another way to iden tify good stocks i s to use software that
can scan all of the listed stocks based on  a series of algebr aic equations that
represent the characteristics of a good chart pattern.  I use Swi ngTracker to
accomplish  this task.
consider the measures used in the algebrai c equations.  Some of the measures are
volume over the past 20 days).  Other measures are based on technical analysis
which is discu ssed in  more det ail in the Appen dix.  Technical analysis  has many
different indicators from a simple mov ing average t o a complex  oscillat or.  It is not
necessary to have an i n-depth understandi ng of technical analysis  to be a successful

away from them.
For long swings  we are i nterested i n identifying stocks that are i n an uptrend.  One
of the i ndicators we use i s a simple moving average (SMA).  A movi ng average i s
simply the average closing price for a partic ular number of days.  It’s cal led a moving
price movement and make it easier to identify  trends.  It is also sign ificant to know
where today’s pri ce is relative to the movi ng averages and whether the shorter time-
frame moving average is above or below th e longer time-frame moving average.
Two indicators that a stock is in an uptrend are:
Visit:  http://www.mrswing.com/      or      emai l: larry@mrswi ng.com A Pract ical Gu ide to Swin g Trading by Larry Swi ng

• The 10-day moving average is above the 20-day moving average
experien cing a brief  declin e (pullback ).  We can  identify a 3-day pullback  as follows.
• Today’s high price is lowe r than yesterday’s high
• Yesterday’s high is lower th an the high the day before
We also use a technical indicator deve loped by Dr. Alexander Elder called the Force
Index .  This index combin es the magn itude of the pri ce change wi th the di rection of
the change and the trading volume.  In orde r to confi rm the rel ative force behi nd an
average of the Force Index.  The following  condi tions demonstrate that the bears
have been wi nning the short-term battl e while bu lls are domin ating the longer
frame:
• The 13-day moving average of the Force Index is greater than 0
Another technical in dicator we like to use is the Directional Movement Index (DMI)
that was dev eloped by  J. Welles Wilder J r.  It is used to determine whether a st ock is
two components of thi s indicator – the Positive Directional Index (+DI) and the
Negati ve Directional Index (-DI) – al ong with a 20-day moving average based on
these two measures (ADX).  An uptrend is confirmed if …
• ADX is higher than 30
• +DI is greater than –DI

6.2 Taking a Profit and Preserving Capital
An important aspect of the Master Plan  is setting a profit target and preserving
capital.  The approach  is fairly conservative – the prof it target is approx imately 7%
with a pot ential loss capped at  4%.  The actual prof it is likely to be more t han 7%

6.3 When to Enter the Trade
trading.  When you enter the trade (and the decision rule you use) depends on
whether or not the stock has gapped up or  down from the previous day’s closing
it opens 50 cents or more higher than the pr evious day’s close;  it is con sidered t o
have gapped down when it opens 50 cents lower than the previous day’s close.
• The most common occurrence – the stoc k opens within 50 cents ($0.50) of
the previous day’s close – the order ca n be placed a few minutes after the
market opens.
• Occasionally a stock gaps up 50 cents or more compared to the previous
day’s close – the order is placed at le ast 30 minutes after the market opens.
• Occasionally a stock gaps down 50 cent s or more compared to the previous
day’s close – the order is placed appr oximately 5 minutes after the market
opens.

same.
• The most common occurrence – the stock opens within 50 cents
($0.50) of the previous day’s close  – buy the stock the moment i t trades
6 cents  (1/16) above the previous day’s high.  This can be accomplished by
using a buy stop order.   This increases t he likelihood that the price is mov ing
in the direct ion of the bullish (long) trade.
• Occasionally a stock gaps up or down 50 cents or more  – buy the stock
the moment it trades 6 cents  above the high of the new day .  This would be
30 minutes after the market opens for a gap up or 5 minutes after the
market opens for a gap down .
6.5 What to do After the Trade is Executed
• The profit order – a sell limit  order is placed at a price that is 7% above the
entry price.
• The capital preservation order – a sell stop (stop limit)  order is placed at
4% below the entry price OR 6 cents below  the low of the day that was
used for the trade (whichever is higher ) – for a stock that opened without a
price action before the day (high and low) sets the prices.

Two additional questions are worth investigating. Did countries in the region

it was during the boom that preceded it? The rest of this chapter addresses these
questions.
The region has shifted toward more exports. . .
The biggest and most important adjustment during the recovery has been the
shift of production capacity toward exports. Despite the slowdown in global

competitive in international markets while reducing investments in real estate
and other nontradable sectors.

flows during the boom have disappeared. These inflows came with a sharp de-
cline in investment ratios in those countries.

Labor productivity growth can be decomposed into three components:
• changes in labor productivity within each economic sector (the within-sector
component)
• changes in labor productivity resulting from the reallocation of labor across
sectors (the shift component)
• a cross component that represents the interaction between the change in labor
productivity within a given sector and the change in labor input share of that
sector.5
tivity growth can be based on the within-sector and shift components. This de-
composition reveals three important trends in the drivers of labor productivity in
Germany and some countries in ECA (figure 1.12).
• The deceleration in labor productivity growth in Germany started during the
1980s and continued in subsequent decades. Most of it was caused by weaker
productivity growth within sectors. This pattern is also evident in other major
European countries.
• The contribution of sectoral shifts to overall labor productivity growth in Ger -
many changed markedly over time. Between the 1970s and the start of the
bor productivity growth by about half a percentage point. The contribution of
sectoral shifts to labor productivity growth fell to zero after 2000 and turned
negative around the time of the 2008 global financial crisis. The long-term

crisis—led to a permanent loss in productivity. Even where productivity
was not recouped. Productivity remains below the levels that would have
been achieved had the crisis not occurred. The lasting impact of deep crises on

are mining cryptocurrencies and providing blockchain services. Governments
are experimenting with blockchain technologies to make their services more
secure and more transparent.
• Many factors provide a fertile ground for these activities in ECA. Several gov-
ernments actively support innovation by start-ups. Governments are eager to
digitize and streamline their services. Lack of trust in existing financial inter -
mediation makes cryptocurrencies an interesting alternative in some coun-
tries. Cryptocurrencies are also used to sidestep oversight of cross-border
mining of cryptocurrencies.
• Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies pose a range of policy chal-

develop alternative means of transferring large funds. Russia is the largest issuer

These mining activities illustrate the dynamic response to new opportunities
by entrepreneurs in the region. They bode well for the development of other ap-
plications of these technologies. But the heavy electricity use by companies that
compete for the right to mine cryptocurrencies is a growing problem. How to

Policy challenges
Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies pose difficult challenges for pol-
icy makers. There is no regulatory framework for transfers made with cryptocur -
rencies or smart contracts. Transfers occur outside anti-money-laundering com-
laws or financial oversight.
Tax codes do not fully cover the new markets if cryptocurrencies are not rec-
ognized in the law as payment systems but are instead viewed as commodities.
It is difficult to determine the geographic location of the value added created by
cryptocurrency mining. Tax legislation therefore has to be adjusted to incorporate
these new activities into direct and indirect tax systems.
Another ambiguity for policy makers is whether these new activities should
be supported or constrained. Should they be encouraged because of positive ex-

eventually reducing the public debt.

Risks and challenges
""
Armenia ’s vulnerability to economic con-
ditions in Russia and its other trading partners —as well as its low level of ex-
port diversification —will remain high.
Adverse shocks linked to the Russian
recovery or metal export prices would
have a negative impact on economic
growth rates over the near to medium
term. Fiscal slippage could trigger the
need for sharper adjustments in public
and real economic activity. Fiscal policy
should remain prudent to contain public
debt levels. Avoiding fiscal procyclicality
will help prevent macroeconomic imbal-
ances and reduce the risks associated
with overheating (including potential
competitiveness losses) during periods of
strong economic growth. Continuing co-
ordination with the monetary authorities
and the maintenance of a flexible ex-
change rate will be vital to avoid episodes
of real exchange rate appreciation that
can lead to losses in competitiveness.
Sustaining robust economic growth will
require bold structural reforms —such as
providing a fair and competitive business
and investment environment —to address
fundamental problems in Armenia's econ-
omy. Increasing country-wide access to
economic opportunities will help to boost
household incomes and drive a further

The economy performed well in 2017.
GDP growth improved markedly to 5
percent —from 2.8 percent in 2016 —led by
an improved external environment. Pru-
dent macro -fiscal policies helped preserve
fiscal space and supported price stability.
Inflation spiked to 6.7 percent (eop) in
2017 in response to higher excise taxes on
percent in February 2018. With inflation
above the ceiling of its target range in 2017
creased the policy rate by 0.75 bps to 7.25
percent over 2017.
Georgia’s external position improved
considerably. Export of goods expanded
by 24 percent on the back of strong de-
by 27 percent; and worker ’s remittances
increased by 21 percent in 2017. Import
gradually the firming oil prices. Gross
FDI inflows increased in 2017 to 12.3 per-
4 months of imports of goods and ser-
vices. Total external debt remained high
at 112 percent of GDP at the end Septem-
ber 2017.
Fiscal policy was prudent. Despite elimi-
nating the income tax on reinvested
creased by 11 percent. To prioritize so-
authorities generated savings of about 0.8 percentage points of GDP from re-
duced administrative costs in 2017. This
helped to scale up public investments to
8.3 percent of GDP and slightly narrow
fiscal deficit to 3.8 percent of GDP from
the 3.9 percent observed in 2016. Georgia ’s
public debt remained sustainable at 44
percent of GDP as of end -2017.

Outlook
""
Georgia’s growth outlook over the medi-
um term is positive. The more benign ex-
ternal environment should facilitate the
development of private sector -led export
sumption from still robust remittances. A
steady implementation of the reform pro-
gram will result in a further acceleration
of growth over the medium term to 5 per-
productivity. Inflation is envisaged to
NBG’s target of 3 percent by year -end
would narrow to below 9 percent of GDP
by 2020.
Considerable consolidation of administra-
and a more efficient social safety net will
help to achieve medium -term fiscal con-
solidation while providing space for capi-
tal spending. Current spending is project-
ed to decline from 24.5 percent of GDP in
containing the wage bill and administra-
tive expenses —which rose steadily and
steeply for at least 4 years —and better
targeting of subsidies and social assistance programs. The fiscal deficit of the general
government will be gradually reduced to
3.0 percent of GDP by 2020 keeping public
mulation of new liabilities or materializa-
tion of contingent liabilities may compro-
mise the expected consolidation and result
in higher debt burden.
Continuous expansion of the economy in
upcoming years should lead to more em-
ployment opportunities and further pov-
erty reduction. Employment opportunities
outside agriculture in rural areas (in par-
ticular) will play a critical role in leading
to significant reductions in lagging re-
gions. Pensions and social assistance are
expected to play a much smaller role for
more limited fiscal space.
""
""
Risks and challenges
""
Georgia’s quasi -fiscal risks emanating
from the contingent liabilities of the State -
Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are substantial
and a source of vulnerability. The Fiscal
Risks Annex to the 2018 Budget Law sug-
gests that the liabilities of the 76 high and
medium risk SOEs are around 20 percent of GDP. Additional risks stem from con-
tingent liabilities generated by the gov-
ernment ’s Power Purchasing Agreements
(PPAs). At the end -2017 there were 72
guarantees to purchase excess electricity
from operators on a seasonal basis. While
additional power capacity are also evi-
dent from the consumption growth trend.
The Government is committed to review
ensuring compliance of new PPAs with
the draft Law on Public Private Partner-
ships that is expected to be approved and
enacted in 2018.
nerable to regional developments given its
and the risks of export demand and re-
mittances shock. The downside risks to
the baseline scenario are associated with
further tightening of US monetary policy
and Lari depreciation; deterioration in the
external environment (including due to a
weaker EU outlook) and regional geopo-
litical tensions.
Rural poverty and high poverty rates in
lagging regions also remain a challenge.
Providing employment opportunities and
raising agricultural productivity will be
critical to address them.

Risks and challenges

Both external and domestic factors present
risks to Kazakhstan ’s medium-term eco-
nomic outlook. The economy ’s vulnerabil-
ity to external shocks remains the main
challenge to achieving stable and sustaina-
ble development. External demand from
as global oil demand and prices will re-
main the key external factors impacting
Kazakhstan ’s economic performance. Do-
mestic factors include the pace of imple-
mentation of structural and institutional
political transition over the medium term.
A potential escalation of problems in the
banking sector is also a concern. To miti-
gate these risks and facilitate a sizeable
expansion of the tradable non -oil sector ’s

from the resumption of EU funding and

in 2017 and improved growth prospects
GDP growth for Poland has been revised
driven by both private consumption and
investment; economic growth may reach
4.2 percent in 2018 and 3.7 percent in
2019. Household spending will benefit

expected to lead to further declines in

The general government deficit is set to
widen again in 2018 to about 2 percent of
GDP —but still safely below the 3 per-

to rise due to higher government con-

increases of the retirement age. The reve-

percent by September 2017 with extreme
poverty stagnant at 14.1 percent of popu-
lation. Income from employment and re-
mittances remain the primary drivers of
poverty reduction. Lower remittances
slowed the pace of poverty reduction in
2017. Poverty was relatively stagnant in
urban areas during 2015 -16 (hovering at
around 24 percent) but became more dy-
namic in 2017 by declining to 22 percent.
During the same period rural poverty fell
from 36.1 percent in 2014 to 33.1 percent
in 2017. Food expenditure accounts for
about 75 percent of total consumption for
poor households. The Listening -to-
Tajikistan survey identified a noticeable
decline in the share of households that
have reduced food consumption to pay
for other basic needs –  from about 45 per-
cent to about 27 percent between Novem-

Over the medium term the fiscal stance is

medium -term fiscal strategy. The fiscal
deficit is projected at around 3 percent of
infrastructure projects and higher debt
service obligations. The baseline scenario
does not assume additional budget sup-

Risks and challenges

Risks are tilted to the downside subject to
external and domestic factors. External
uncertainties may negatively affect re-
mittance inflows. Domestic vulnerabilities
include the adequate resolution of prob-
hance the business climate. The country ’s
deteriorated debt trend and growing debt
service obligations pose macro -fiscal chal-
lenges and limit the fiscal space for much
needed social spending. Any potential
banking sector bailout and/or second -
round of Eurobonds issuance will sub-
stantially threaten the country ’s fragile
macroeconomic stability.

risks in adopting further reforms needed to
promote stronger economic growth.
Macroeconomic vulnerabilities come total
fiscal financing needs of $18 billion in 2018
and 2019 that will require mobilizing
about $8 billion in external financing. Ad-
ditional fiscal pressures come from the

through the 2019 elections.
Financial sector weaknesses from high

be deciphered (or decrypted) by someone who possesses a secret key.48 Cryptocurrencies such as
Hereinafter we try  to give a suitable definition of cryptocurrencies on the basis of a critical analysis of
the definitions already developed by various concerned policy makers at European and international
leve l.50
a. ECB
The European Central Bank (“ ECB”) has classified cryptocurrencies as a subset of virtual currencies. In a
of a specific virtual community .52
It further clarified that  three types of virtual currencies can be distinguished d epending on the
interaction with traditional currencies and the real economy :
(e.g. World of Warcraft Gol d);
ii. virtual currencies  that are unilaterally linked to the real economy: a conversion rate exists to
purchase the currency (with traditional money) and the purchased currency can subsequently
be used to buy virtual goods and services (and exceptionally al so to buy real goods and
services) (e.g. Facebook Credits);
iii. virtual currencies  that are bilaterally linked to the real economy: there are conversion rates
both for purchasing virtual currency as for selling such currency; the purchased currency can
be use d to buy both virtual as real goods and services.53

b. IMF
c. BIS
These schemes are said to  exhibit the following key features:
ii. they make u se of distributed ledgers to allow remote peer -to-peer exchanges of electronic
value in the absence of trust between parties and without the need for intermediaries ; and
iii. they are not operated by any specific individual or institution .60
d. EBA
The European Banking Authority ( “EBA ”) has suggested to refer to  cryptocurrencies  as virtual

It further suggests that virtual currencies  can be divided  into two basic types:
i. convertible virtual  currencies  that have an equivalent value in real currency and can be
exchanged back -and -forth for real currency ; these virtual currencies can be o f a centralised or
a decentraliz ed nature (i.e. they can either have a central administrating authority that
controls the system or no central oversight at all);  and
ii. non-convertible virtual currencies that are specific to a particular virtual domain or world (e.g.

InstantSend  (Dash ’s anonymity and instant transaction features).284
Transactions with traditional c ryptocurrencies can be very time- consuming  (i.e. they can take
anywhere between  a few minutes and  more than one hour). This is due to the fact that enough blocks
have to pass to ensure that a transaction is irreversible and at the same time not an attempt to
double -spend money that has already been spent.285 Dash tackles this issue utilising its masternode
network. Masternodes can be called upon to form voting quorums to check wh ether or not a

The fight against money laundering and terrorism financing is a key priority of the international

"Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force ("" FATF "") – drawn up in 1990 and revised from"
time to time – are the cornerstone o f the international framework for combating money laundering
recognised as setting out the international standards.317
"The European Union adopted its first Anti -Money  Laundering D irective on 10 June 1991 ("" AMLD1 "").318"
An anti -money laundering framework at the level of the European Union was needed to coordinate
measures across the different Member States and safeguard the stability of the financial system as a
whole. Thi s first Anti -Money L aundering Directive was later amended by the second  Anti -Money

ADEQUACY OF THE REGU LATORY FRAMEWORK
5.1. Introduction
Now that we have a clear picture of the current and upcoming regulatory framework for combating
whether that framework is adequate to address the many challenges cryptocurrencies bring.
The existing framework is not adequate. This we have already analysed above.
How does the upcoming AMLD5 score and what would be a good way forward?
We will hereinafter try to answer that question on the basis of a number of more technical sub -
questions394. The questions are the following.
• Is the definition of virtual currencies sufficient to capture the cryptocurrencies that can be used to
• Is it enough to include only custodian wallet providers and virtual currency exchanges in the list
of obliged entities ?
• Does the AMLD5 framework allow to pull enough cryptocurrency users into the light?
• Would it make se nse to extend the scope of the Funds Transfer Regulation and/or the C ash
Control R egulation as to include cryptocurrency transactions?
cryptocurrency players?
• Is it not best to outright ban some activities or aspects linked to cryptocurrencies?
evasion via cryptocurrency transactions?
It is not our intention to give the definitive answer to all the questions raised. What we do intend  is to
give our analysis and to fuel the further debate.

We will begin the trading day with a gap up at the open:
Charlene’s Method and Finding Stocks That Will Gap at the Open
Description The purpose of this trade is to find stock that will run up or gap up in the open.
Advantage Requires only about and hour (maybe a little more) each day
Disadvantage Market may go against you at the open; there is always a degree of risk in holding
a stock overnight. This method works best when there is a rally on the open.
Caution Check

that is going to announce the following morning. Also check the news onthe stock.

Description Rockets are those stocks that should shoot up in the open and possibly carry on
through the day.

previous evening. Many Wizetraders are claiming success with Rockets.

Between 9:45 to 9:55 pick the one(s) that have the best angle and separation
start back up right after 10:00.
Exit before 11:00. Stocks tend to go flat and it’s profit-taking time (just as be-
