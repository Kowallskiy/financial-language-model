SYSTEM

 Functions of  a financial system  
 The structure and key features of financial markets  
 The key features of financial intermediaries  
 Major financial market participants  
 
1.1. Financial system structure and functions  
The financial system  plays the key role in the economy by stimulating economic growth, 
influencing economic performance of the actors, affecting economic welfare. This is 
achieved by financial infrastructure, in which entities with funds allocate those funds to 
those who have potentiall y more productive ways to invest those funds. A financial system 
makes it possible a more efficient transfer of funds. As one party of the transaction may 
possess superior information than the other party, it can lead to the information asymmetry 
problem a nd inefficient allocation of financial resources. By overcoming the information 
asymmetry problem the financial system facilitates balance between those with funds to 
invest and those needing funds.  
According to the structural approach, the financial syst em of an economy consists of 
three main components:  
1) financial markets;  
2) financial intermediaries (institu tions);  
3) financial regulators.  
Each of the components plays a specific role in the economy.  
According to the  functional approach , financial  markets  facilitate the flow of funds in 
order to finance investments by corporations, governments and individuals. Financial 
institutions  are the key players in the financial markets as they perform the function of 
intermediation and thus determine the fl ow of funds. The financial regulators  perform the 
role of monitoring and regulating the participants in the financial system.

Short term fixed securities market  Banking sec tor 
Governments   7 Financial markets  studies , based on  capital market theory, focus on  the financial system, 
the structure of interest rates, and the pricing of financial assets.  
An asset  is any resource that is expected to provide future benefits, and thus possesses 
economic value. Assets are divided into two categories: ta ngible assets with physical 
properties and intangible assets. An intangible asset represents a legal claim to some future 
economic benefits. The value of an intangible asset bears no relation to the form, physical 
or otherwise, in which the claims are reco rded.  
Financial assets , often called  financial instruments , are intangible assets, which are 
expected to provide future benefits in  the form of a claim to future cash. Some financial 
instruments are called securities and generally include stocks and bonds .  
Any transaction related to financial instrument includes at least two parties:  
1) the party that has agreed to make future cash payments and is called the issuer ; 
2) the party that owns the financial instrument, and therefore the right to receive the 
payments  made by the issuer, is called the investor . 
Financial assets provide the following key economic functions .  
 they allow the transfer of funds from those entities, who have surplus funds 
to invest to those who need fun ds to invest in tangible assets;  
 they r edistribute the unavoidable risk related to cash generation among 
deficit and surplus economic units.  
The claims held by the final wealth holders generally differ from the liabilities issued by 
those entities who demand  those  funds . They role is performed by the specific entities 
operating in financial systems, called financial intermediaries . The latter ones  transform 
the final liabilities into different financial assets preferred by the public.  
 
1.2. Financial markets and their economic functions  
A financial market is a market where financial instruments are exchanged or traded. 
Financial markets provide the following three major economic functions : 
1) Price discovery  
2) Liquidity  
3) Reduction of transaction costs  
1) Price discovery  function  means that transactions bet ween buyers and sellers of 
financial instruments in a financial market determine the price of the traded asset. At the 
same time the required return from the investment of funds is determined by the 
participants in a financial market. The motivation for th ose seeking funds (deficit units) 
depends on the required return that investors demand. It is these functions of financial 
markets that signal how the funds available from those who want to lend or invest funds 
will be allocated among those needing funds a nd raise those funds by issuing financial 
instruments.  
2) Liquidity function provides an opportunity for investors to sell a financial instrument, 
since it is referred to as a measure of the ability to sell an asset at its fair market value at 
any time. Wi thout liquidity, an investor would be forced to hold a financial instrument 
until conditions arise to sell it or the issuer is contractually obligated to pay it off. Debt 
instrument is liquidated when it matures, and equity instrument is until the company is  8 either voluntarily or involuntarily liquidated. All financial markets provide some form of 
liquidity. However, different financial markets are characterized by the degree of liquidity.  
3) The function of reduction of transaction costs  is performed, when  financial market 
participants are charged and/or bear the costs of trading a financial instrument. In market 
economies the economic rationale for the existence of institutions and instruments is 
related to transaction costs, thus the surviving institution s and instruments are those that 
have the lowest transaction costs.  
The key attributes determining transaction costs are  
 asset specificity,  
 uncertainty , 
 frequency of occurrence.  
Asset specificity  is related to the way transaction is organized and execut ed. It is lower 
when an asset can be easily put to alternative use, can be deployed for different tasks 
without significant costs.  
Transactions are also related to uncertainty , which has (1) external sources (when events 
change beyond control of the contr acting parties), and (2) depends on opportunistic 
behavior of the contracting parties. If changes in external events are readily verifiable, then 
it is possible to make adaptations to original contracts, taking into account problems 
caused by external unce rtainty. In this case there is a possibility to control transaction 
costs.  However, when circumstances are not easily observable, opportunism creates 
incentives for contracting parties to review the initial contract and creates moral hazard 
problems.  The  higher the uncertainty, the more opportunistic behavior may be observed, 
and the higher transaction costs may be born.  
Frequency of occurrence  plays an important role in determining if a transaction should 
take place within the market or within the firm. A one -time transaction may reduce costs 
when it is executed in the market. Conversely, frequent transactions require detailed 
contracting and should take place within a firm in order to reduce the costs.  
When assets are specific, transactions are frequent , and there are significant uncertainties 
intra-firm transactions may be the least costly. And, vice versa, if assets are non -specific, 
transactions are infrequent, and there are no significant uncertainties least costly may be 
market transactions.  
The men tioned attributes of transactions and the underlying incentive problems are related 
to behavioural  assumptions about the transacting parties. The economists (Coase (1932, 
1960, 1988), Williamson (1975, 1985), Akerlof (1971) and others) have contributed to 
transactions costs economics by analyzing behaviour  of the human beings, assumed 
generally self -serving and rational in their conduct, and also behaving opportunistically. 
Opportunistic behaviour  was understood as involving actions with incomplete and 
distorted information that may intentionally mislead the other party. This type of behavior 
requires efforts of ex ante screening of transaction parties, and ex post safeguards as well 
as mutual restraint among the parties, which leads to specific transaction costs.   
Transaction costs  are classified into:  
1) costs of search and information,  
2) costs of contracting and monitoring,  
3) costs of incentive problems between buyers and sellers of financial assets.  
1) Costs of search and information  are defined in the follo wing way:   9  search  costs fall into categories of explicit costs and implicit costs.  
Explicit costs  include expenses that may be needed to advertise one’s intention to sell 
or purchase a financial instrument. Implicit costs  include the value of time spent in  
locating counterparty to the transaction. The presence of an organized financial market 
reduces search costs.  
 information  costs are associated with assessing a financial instrument’s investment 
attributes. In a price efficient market, prices reflect the a ggregate information 
collected by all market participants.  
2) Costs of contracting and monitoring  are related to the costs necessary to resolve 
information asymmetry problems, when the two parties entering into the transaction 
possess limited information o n each other and seek to ensure that the transaction 
obligations are fulfilled.  
3) Costs of incentive problems  between buyers and sellers arise, when there are conflicts 
of interest between the two parties, having different incentives for the transactions  
involving financial assets.  
The functions of a market are performed by its diverse participants. The participants in 
financial markets can be also classified into various groups, according to their motive for 
trading:  
 Public investors, who ultimately own  the securities and who are motivated by the 
returns from holding the securities. Public investors include private individuals and 
institutional investors, such as pension funds and mutual funds.  
 Brokers, who act as agents for public investors and who are motivated by the 
remuneration received (typically in the form of commission fees) for the services 
they provide. Brokers thus trade for others and not on their own account.  
 Dealers, who do trade on their own account but whose primary motive is to profit 
from trading rather than from holding securities. Typically, dealers obtain their 
return from the differences between the prices at which they buy and sell the 
security over short intervals of time.  
 Credit rating agencies (CRAs) that assess the credit risk o f borrowers.  
In reality three groups are not mutually exclusive. Some public investors may occasionally 
act on behalf of others; brokers may act as dealers and hold securities on their own, while 
dealers often hold securities in excess of the inventories n eeded to facilitate their trading 
activities. The role of these three groups differs according to the trading mechanism 
adopted by a financial market.  
 
1.3. Financial intermediaries and their functions  
Financial intermediary  is a special financial entity, which  performs the role of efficient 
allocation of funds, when there are conditions that make it difficult for lenders or investors 
of funds to deal directly with borrowers of funds in financial markets. Financial 
intermediaries include depository institutions,  insurance companies, regulated investm ent 
companies,  investment banks, pension funds.  
The role of financial intermediaries is to create more favourable transaction terms than 
could be realized by lenders/investors and borrowers dealing directly with each  other in 
the financial market.  
The financial intermediaries are engaged in:   10  obtaining funds from lenders or investors and  
 lending or investing the funds that they borrow to those who need funds.  
The funds that a financial intermediary acquires become, depending on the financial claim, 
either the liability of the financial intermediary or equity participants of the financial 
intermediary. The funds that a financial intermediary lends or invests become the asset of 
the financial intermediary.  
Financial in termediaries are engaged in transformation of financial assets, which are less 
desirable for a large part of the investing public into other financial assets —their own 
liabilities —which are more widely preferred by the public.  
Asset transformation  provide s at least one of three economic functions:  
 Maturity intermediation.  
 Risk reduction via diversification.  
 Cost reduction for contracting and information processing.

These economic functions are performed by financial market participants while providing 
the special financial services (e.g. the first and second functions can be performed by 
brokers,  dealer s and market maker s. The third function is related to the service of 
underwriting of securities).  
Other services that can be provided by financial intermediaries include:

distributing those financial assets to other market participants.  
 Providing investment advice to customers.

1.4. Financial  markets structure  
1.4.1.  Financial instruments  
There is a great variety of financial instrument in the financial marketplace. The use of 
these instruments by major market participants depends upon their offered risk and return 
characteristics, as well as availabilit y in retail or wholesale markets. The general view on 
the financial instrument categories is provided in Table 1.

A financial instrume nt can be classified by the type of claims that the investor has on the 
issuer. A financial instrument in which the issuer agrees to pay the investor interest plus 
repay the amount borrowed is a debt instrument . A debt instrument also referred to as an 
instrument of indebtedness , can be in the form of a note, bond, or loan. The interest 
payments that must be made by the issuer are fixed contractually. For example, in the case 
of a debt instrument that is required to make payments in Euros, the amount can be  a fixed 
Euro amount or it can vary depending upon some benchmark. The investor in a debt 
instrument can realize no more than the contractual amount. For this reason, debt 
instruments are often called fixed income instruments .  12 Fixed income instruments form a a wide and diversified fixed income market. The key 
characteristics of it is provided in Table 2.

In contrast to a debt obligation, an equity instrument  specifies that the issuer pays the 
investor an amount based on earnings, if any, after the obligations that the issuer is 
required to make to investors of the firm’s debt instruments have been paid.  
Common stock  is an example of equity instruments. Some fin ancial instruments due to 
their characteristics can be viewed as a mix of debt and equity.  
Preferred stock  is a financial instrument, which has the attribute of a debt because 
typically the investor is only entitled to receive a fixed contractual amount. However, it is 
similar to an equity instrument because the payment is only made after payments to the 
investors in the firm’s debt instruments are satisfied.  
Another “combination” instrument is a convertible bond , which allows the investor to 
convert debt  into equity under certain circumstances.  Because preferred stockholders 
typically are entitled to a fixed contractual amount, preferred stock is referred to as a fixed 
income instrument .  
Hence, fixed income instruments include debt instruments and prefer red stock.  
 The features of debt an d equity instruments are contras ted in Table 3.  
The classification of debt and equity is especially important for two legal reasons.  First, in 
the case of a bankruptcy of the issuer, investor in debt instruments has a pr iority on the  13 claim on the issuer’s assets over equity investors. Second, the tax treatment of the 
payments by the issuer can differ depending on the type of financial instrument class.

1.4.2.  Classification of financial markets  
There different ways to classify financial markets. They are classified according to the 
financial instruments they are trading, features of services they provide, trading 
procedures, key market particip ants, as well as the origin of the markets.  
The generalized financial market classification is given in Table 4.

internal market and an external market.  
The internal market , also called  the national market , consists  of two parts: the domestic 
market and the foreign market. The domestic market  is where issuers domic iled in the 
country issue securities and where those securities are subsequently traded.  
The foreign market  is where securities are sold and traded  outside the country of issuers .  
External market  is the market where securities with the following two dist inguishing 
features are trading: 1) at issuance they are offered simultaneously to investors in a number 
of countries; and 2) they are issued outside the jurisdiction of any single country. The 
external market is also referred to as the international  marke t, offshore market , and the 
Euromarket  (despite the fact that this market is not limited to Europe).  
Money market  is the sector of the financial market that includes financial instruments that 
have a maturity or redemption date that is one year or less at the time of issuance. These 
are mainly wholesale markets . 
The capital market  is the sector of the fi nancial mark et where long -term fi nancial 
instruments issued by corporations and governments trade. Here “long -term” refers to a 
financial instrument with an  original maturity greater than one year and perpetual 
securities (those with no maturity). There are two types of capital market securities: those 
that represent shares of ownership interest, also called equity , issued by corporations, and 
those that repr esent indebtedness,  or debt  issued b y corporations and by the state  and local 
governments.  
Financial markets can be classified in terms of cash market  and derivative markets .  
The cash market , also referred to as the spot market , is the market for the imme diate 
purchase and sale of a financial instrument.  
In contrast, some financial instruments are contracts that specify that the contract holder 
has either the obligation or the choice to buy or sell another something at or by some 
future date. The “somethi ng” that is the subject of the contract is called the underlying  
(asset) . The underlying  asset  is a stock, a bond, a financial index, an interest rate, a 
currency, or a commodity. Because the price of such contracts derive their value from the 
value of the  underlying  assets , these contracts are called derivative instruments  and the 
market where they are traded is called the derivatives market .  
When a financial instrument is first issued, it is sold in the primary market . A secondary 
market  is such in which  financial instruments are resold among investors. No new capital 
is raised by the issuer of the security. Trading takes place among investors.  
Secondary markets are also classified in terms of organized stock exchanges and over -the-
counter (OTC) markets.  
Stock exchanges  are central trading locations where financial instruments are traded. In 
contrast, an OTC market  is generally where unlisted financial instruments are traded.  
 
1.5. Financial market regulation  
In general, financial market regulation is aimed to ensure the fair treatment of participants. 
Many regulations have been enacted in response to fraudulent practices. One of the key 
aims of regulation is to ensure business disclosure of accurate information for investment 
decision making. When information i s disclosed only to limited set of investors, those 
have major advantages over other groups of investors. Thus regulatory framework has to 
provide the equal access to disclosures by companies.  The recent regulations were passed  15 in response to large bankrup tcies, overhauled corporate governance, in order to strengthen 
the role of auditors in overseeing accounting procedures.  The Sorbanes -Oxley Act of 2002 
in US was designed particularly to tighten companies’ governance after dotcom bust and 
Enron’s Bankruptc y. It had direct consequences internationally, first of all through global 
companies. The US Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd -Frank) of 
2010 aims at imposing tighter financial regulation for the financial markets and financial 
intermedi aries in US, in order to ensure consumer protection. This is in tune with major 
financial regulation system development in EU and other parts of the world.  
 
1.6. Summary  
The financial system of an economy consists of three components: (1) Financial markets; 
(2) financial intermediaries; and (3) financial regulators.  
The main function of the system is to channel funds between the two groups of end users 
of the system: from lenders (‘surplus units’) to borrowers (‘deficit units’). Besides, a 
financial system provi des payments facilities, a variety of services such as insurance, 
pensions and foreign exchange, together with facilities which allow people to adjust their 
existing wealth portfolios.  
Apart from direct borrowing and lending between end -users, borrowing an d lending 
through  intermediaries and organized markets  have important advantages. These  include 
transforming the maturity of short -term savings into longer -term loans, reduction of risk 
and controlling transaction costs.   
The field of financial markets and  its theoretical foundations is based on the study of the 
financial system, the structure of interest rates, and the pricing of risky assets.  
The major market players are households, governments, nonfinancial corporations, 
depository institutions, insuranc e companies, asset management firms, investment banks, 
nonprofit organizations, and foreign investors.  
Financial markets  are classified into  internal versus external markets, capital markets 
versus  money markets, cash versus derivative markets, primary ver sus secondary  markets, 
private placement versus public markets, exchange -traded versus over -the-counter 
markets.  
The financial markets and intermediaries are subject to financial regulators. The recent 
changes in the regulatory system  are happening in res ponse to the problems in the credit 
markets and financial crisis that struck 2008.

For financing and investing decision making in a dynamic financial environment of market 
participants, it is crucial to understand interest rates as one of the key aspects of the 
financial environment. Several economic theories explain determinants of the level of 
interest rates. Another group of theories explain the variety of interest rates and their term 
structure, i.e. relationship between interest rates and the maturity of debt  instruments.  
 
2.1. Interest rate determination  
2.1.1.  The rate of interest  
Interest rate is a rate of return paid by a borrower of funds to a lender of them, or a price 
paid by a borrower for a service, the right to make use of funds for a specified period. Thus 
it is one form of yield on financial instruments. Two questions are being raised by market 
participants:  
 What determines the average rate of interest in an economy?  
 Why do interest rates differ on different types and lengths of loans and debt 
instruments?  
Interest rates vary depending on borrowing or lending decision. There is interest rate at 
which banks are lending (the offer rate) and interest rate they are paying for deposits (the 
bid rate). The difference between them is called a spread . Such a spread als o exists 
between selling and buying rates in local and international money and capital markets. The 
spread between offer and bid rates provides a cover for administrative costs of the 
financial intermediaries and includes their profit. The spread is influe nced by the degree of 
competition among financial institutions. In the short -term international money markets 
the spread is lower if there is considerable competition. Conversely, the spread between 
banks borrowing and lending rates to their retail custome rs is larger in general due to 
considerably larger degree of loan default risk. Thus the lending rate (offer or ask rate) 
always includes a risk premium . 
Concept  
 Risk premium  is an addition to the interest rate demanded 
by a lender to take into account t he risk that the borrower 
might default on the loan entirely or may not repay on time 
(default risk).   18 There are several factors that determine the risk premium for a non - Government security, 
as compared with the Government security of the same maturity.  These are (1) the 
perceived creditworthiness of the issuer, (2) provisions of securities such as conversion 
provision, call provision, put provision, (3) interest taxes, and (4) expected liquidity of a 
security’s issue.  
In order to explain the determinant s of interest rates in general, the economic theory 
assumes there is some particular interest rate, as a representative of all interest rates in an 
economy. Such an interest rate usually depends upon the topic considered, and can 
represented by e.g. intere st rate on government short -term or long -term debt, or the base 
interest rate of the commercial banks, or a short -term money market rate (EURIBOR). In 
such a case it is assumed that the interest rate structure is stable and that all interest rates in 
the e conomy are likely to move in the same direction.  
Concept  
 Interest rate structure is the relationships between the 
various rates of interest in an economy on financial 
instruments of different lengths (terms) or of different 
degrees of risk.  
The rates o f interest quoted by financial institutions are nominal rates, and are used to 
calculate interest payments to borrowers and lenders. However, the loan repayments 
remain the same in money terms and make up a smaller and smaller proportion of the 
borrower’s income. The real cost of the interest payments declines over time. Therefore 
there is a real interest  rate, i.e. the rate of interest adjusted to take into account the rate of 
inflation. Since the real rate of return to the lender can be also falling over time, the lender 
determines interest rates to take into account the expected rate of inflation over the period 
of a loan. When there is uncertainty about the real rate of return to be received by the 
lender, he will be inclined to lend at fixed interest ra tes for short -term.  
The loan can be ‘rolled over’ at a newly set rate of interest to reflect changes in the 
expected rate of inflation. On the other hand, lenders can set a floating interest rate, which 
is adjusted to the inflation rate changes.  
Concept  
 Real interest rate is the difference between the nominal rate 
of interest and the expected rate of inflation. It is a measure 
of the anticipated opportunity cost of borrowing in terms of 
goods and services forgone.  
The dependence between the real and nomi nal interest rates is expressed using the 
following equation:  
i =(1+ r)(1+ ie) - 1  
where i is the nominal rate of interest, r is the real rate of interest and ie e is the expected 
rate of inflation.  
Example  
 Assume that a bank is providing a company wit h a loan of 
1000 thous. Euro for one year at a real rate of interest of  3 
per cent. At the end of the year it expects to receive back 
1030 thous. Euro of purchasing power at current prices. 
However, if the bank expects a 10 per cent rate of inflation 
over the next year, it will want 1133 thous. Euro back (10 per 
cent above 1030 thous. Euro). The interest rate required by 
the bank would be 13.3 per cent  
i =(1+ 0,03)(1 + 0,1) - 1 = (1,03)(1,1) - 1 = 1,133 - 1=0,133 
or 13,3 per cent   19 When simplified, the equ ation becomes: i = r + ie  
In the example, this would give 3 per cent plus 10 per cent = 13 per cent.  
The real rate of return is thus: r = i - ie  
When assumption is made that r is stable over time, the equation provides the Fisher 
effect. It suggest s that changes in short -term interest rates occur because of changes in the 
expected rate of inflation. If a further assumption is made that expectations about the rate 
of inflation of market participants are correct, then the key reason for changes in int erest 
rates is the changes in the current rate of inflation.  
Borrowers and lenders think mostly in terms of real interest rates. There are two economic 
theories explaining the level of real interest rates in an economy:  
 The loanable funds theory  
 Liquidit y preference theory  
 
2.1.2.  Interest rate theories: loanable funds theory  
In an economy, there is a supply loanable funds (i.e., credit) in the capital market by 
households, business, and governments. The higher the level of interest rates, the more 
such entities  are willing to supply loan funds; the lower the level of interest, the less they 
are willing to supply. These same entities demand loanable funds, demanding more when 
the level of interest rates is low and less when interest rates are higher.  
The extent to which people are willing to postpone consumption depends upon their time 
preference.  
Concept  
 Time preference describes the extent to which a person is 
willing to give up the satisfaction obtained from present 
consumption in return for increased consump tion in the 
future.  
The term ‘loanable funds’ simply refers to the sums of money offered for lending and 
demanded by consumers and investors during a given period. The interest rate in the 
model is determined by the interaction between potential borrowers  and potential savers.  
 
Concept  
 Loanable funds are funds borrowed and lent in an economy 
during a specified period of time – the flow of money from 
surplus to deficit units in the economy.  
The loanable funds theory was formulated by the Swedish economist  Knut Wicksell in 
the 1900s. According to him, the level of interest rates is determined by the supply and 
demand of loanable funds available in an economy’s credit market (i.e., the sector of the 
capital markets for long -term debt instruments). This theor y suggests that investment and 
savings in the economy determine the level of long -term interest rates. Short -term interest 
rates, however, are determined by an economy’s financial and monetary conditions.  
According to the loanable funds theory f or the eco nomy as a whole:  
Demand for loanable funds  =  net investment + net additions to liquid reserves  
Supply of loanable funds = net savings + increase in the money supply  
Given the importance of loanable funds and that the major suppliers of loanable funds are 
commercial banks, the key role of this financial intermediary in the determination of  20 interest rates is vivid. The central bank is implementing specific monetary policy, therefore 
it influences the supply of loanable funds from commercial banks and thereby  changes the 
level of interest rates. As central bank increases (decreases) the supply of credit available 
from commercial banks, it decreases (increases) the level of interest rates.  
 
2.1.3.  Interest rate theories: liquidity preference theory  
Saving and investme nt of market participants under economic uncertainty may be much 
more influenced by expectations and by exogenous shocks than by underlying real forces. 
A possible response of risk -averse savers is to vary the form in which they hold their 
financial wealth  depending on their expectations about asset prices. Since they are 
concerned about the risk of loss in the value of assets, they are likely to vary the average 
liquidity of their portfolios.  
 
Concept  
 A liquid asset  is the one that can be turned into mon ey 
quickly, cheaply and for a known monetary value.  
Liquidity preference theory  is another one aimed at explaining interest rates. J. M. 
Keynes has proposed (back in 1936) a simple model, which explains how interest rates are 
determined based on the prefe rences of households to hold money balances rather than 
spending or investing those funds.  
Money balances can be held in the form of currency or checking accounts, however it does 
earn a very low interest rate or no interest at all. A key element in the t heory is the 
motivation for individuals to hold money balance despite the loss of interest income. 
Money is the most liquid of all financial assets and, of course, can easily be utilized to 
consume or to invest. The quantity of money held by individuals de pends on their level of 
income and, consequently, for an economy the demand for money is directly related to an 
economy’s income. There is a trade -off between holding money balance for purposes of 
maintaining liquidity and investing or lending funds in les s liquid debt instruments in order 
to earn a competitive market interest rate. The difference in the interest rate that can be 
earned by investing in interest -bearing debt instruments and money balances represents an 
opportunity cost for maintaining liquid ity. The lower the opportunity cost, the greater the 
demand for money balances; the higher the opportunity cost, the lower the demand for 
money balance.  
Concept  Liquidity preference  is preference for holding financial 
wealth in the form of short -term, hig hly liquid assets rather 
than long -term illiquid assets, based principally on the fear 
that long -term assets will lose capital value over time.  
According to the liquidity preference theory, the level of interest rates is determined by the 
supply and deman d for money balances. The money supply is controlled by the policy 
tools available to the country’s Central Bank. Conversely, in the loan funds theory the 
level of interest rates is determined by supply and demand, however it is in the credit 
market.  
 
2.2. The structure of interest rates  
The variety of interest rates that exist in the economy and the structure of interest rates is 
subject to considerable change due to different factors. Such changes are important to the 
operation of monetary policy. Interest rat es vary because of differences in the time period,  21 the degree of risk, and the transactions costs associated with different financial 
instruments. Figure 3 provides an overview of the factors influencing interest rates and  
Figure 3. Framework for Forecasting Interest Rates  
Source: Madura J. (2008). Financial Institutions and Markets.  
thus the general framework for forecasting them.  
The greater the risk of default associated with an asset, the higher must be t he interest rate 
paid upon it as compensation for the risk. This explains why some borrowers pay higher 
rates of interest than others.  Future State of

company’s size, profitability or p ast performance; or, it may be determined more formally 
by credit rating agencies. Borrowers with high credit ratings will be able to have 
commercial bills accepted by banks, find willing takers for their commercial paper or 
borrow directly from banks at l ower rates of interest. Such borrowers are often referred to 
as prime borrowers. Those less favored may have to borrow from other sources at higher 
rates.  
The same principle applies to the comparison between interest rates on sound risk -free 
loans (such a s government bonds) and expected yields on equities. The more risky a 
company is thought to be, the lower will be its share price in relation to its expected 
average dividend payment – that is, the higher will be its dividend yield and the more 
expensive i t will be for the company to raise equity capital.  
 
2.3. Term structure of interest rates  
The relationship between the yields on comparable securities but different maturities is 
called the term structure of interest rates . The primary focus here is the Treasu ry 
market. The graphic that depicts the relationship between the yield on Treasury securities 
with different maturities is known as the yield curve  and, therefore, the maturity spread is 
also referred to as the yield curve spread .  
Concept  
 Yield curve: Shows the relationships between the interest 
rates payable on bonds with different lengths of time to 
maturity. That is, it shows the term structure of interest rates.  
The focus on the Treasury yield curve functions is due mainly because of its role as a 
benchmark for setting yields in many other sectors of the debt market. However, a 
Treasury yield curve based on observed yields on the Treasury market is an unsatisfactory 
measure of the relation between required yield and maturity. The key reason is that 
securities with the same maturity may actually provide different yields.  
Hence, it is necessary to develop more accurate and reliable estimates of the Treasury 
yield curve. It is important to estimate the theoretical interest rate that the Treasury would 
have to pay assuming that the security it issued is a zero -coupon security.  
If the term structure is plotted a t a given point in time, based on the yield to maturity, or 
the spot rate, at successive maturities against maturity, one of the three shapes of th e yield 
curve would be observed. The type of yield curve, when the yield increases with maturity, 
is referred to as an upward -sloping yield  curve or a positively sloped yield curve . A 
distinction is made for upward sloping yield curves based on the steepne ss of the yield 
curve. The steepness of the yield curve is typically measured in terms of the maturity 
spread between the long -term and short -term yields.  
A downward -sloping or inverted yield curve is the one , where yields in general decline 
as maturity i ncreases.  
A variant of the flat yield  is the one in which the yield on short -term and long -term 
Treasuries are similar but the yield on intermediate -term Treasuries are much lower than, 
for example, the six -month and 30 -year yields. Such a yield curve is referred to as a 
humped yield curve .  
 
2.4. Theories of term structure of interest rates  
There are several major economic theories that explain the observed shapes of the yield 
curve:   23  Expectations theory  
 Liquidity premium theory  
 Market segmentation theory  
 Preferred habitat theory  
 
2.4.1.  Expectations theory  
The pure expectations theory assumes that investors are indifferent between investing for a 
long period on the one hand and investing for a shorter period with a view to reinvesting 
the principal plus interest on t he other hand. For example an investor would have no 
preference between making a 12 -month deposit and making a 6 -month deposit with a view 
to reinvesting the proceeds for a further six months so long as the expected interest 
receipts are the same. This is equivalent to saying that the pure expectations theory 
assumes that investors treat alternative maturities as perfect substitutes for one another.  
The pure expectations theory assumes that investors are risk -neutral. A risk -neutral 
investor is not concerne d about the possibility that interest rate expectations will prove to 
be incorrect, so long as potential favourable deviations from expectations are as likely as 
unfavourable ones. Risk is not regarded negatively.  
However, most investors are risk -averse, i .e. they are prepared to forgo some investment 
return in order to achieve greater certainty about return and value of their investments. As 
a result of risk -aversion, investors may not be indifferent between alternative maturities. 
Attitudes to risk may ge nerate preferences for either short or long maturities. If such is the 
case, the term structure of interest rates (the yield curve) would reflect risk premiums.  
Question    
 How a yield curve would shift in response to sudden 
expectations of rising interest  rates according to pure 
expectations theory?  
If an investment is close to maturity, there is little risk of capital loss arising from interest 
rate changes. A bond with a distant maturity (long duration) would suffer considerable 
capital loss in the even t of a large rise in interest rates. The risk of such losses is known as 
capital risk . 
To compensate for the risk that capital loss might be realised on long -term investments, 
investors may require a risk premium on such investments. A risk premium is an a ddition 
to the interest or yield to compensate investors for accepting risk. This results in an upward 
slope to a yield curve. This tendency towards an upward slope is likely to be reinforced by 
the preference of many borrowers to borrow for long periods ( rather than borrowing for a 
succession of short periods).  
Some investors may prefer long maturity investments because they provide greater 
certainty of income flows. This uncertainty is income risk . If investors have a preference 
for predictability of int erest receipts, they may require a higher rate of interest on short -
term investments to compensate for income risk. This would tend to cause the yield curve 
to be inverted (downward sloping).  
The effects on the slope of the yield curve from factors such as  capital risk and income risk 
are in addition to the effect of expectations of future short -term interest rates. If money 
market participants expect short -term interest rates to rise, the yield curve would tend to be 
upward sloping. If the effect of capita l risk were greater than the effect of income risk, the 
upward slope would be steeper. If market expectations were that short -term interest rates 
would fall in the future, the yield curve would tend to be downward sloping. A dominance  24 of capital -risk avers ion over income -risk aversion would render the downward slope less 
steep (or possibly turn a downward slope into an upward slope).

2.4.2.  Liquidity premium theory  
Some investors may prefer to own shorter rather than longer term securities because a 
shorter maturity represents greater liquidity. In such case they will be  willing to hold long 
term securities only if compensated with a premium for the lower degree of liquidity. 
Though long -term securities may be liquidated prior to maturity, their prices are more 
sensitive to interest rate movements. Short -term securities a re usually considered to be 
more liquid because they are more likely to be converted to cash without a loss in value. 
Thus there is a liquidity premium for less liquid securities which changes over time. The 
impact of liquidity premium on interest rates is  explained by liquidity premium theory.

According to the market segmentation theory, interest rates for different maturities are 
determined independently of one another. The interest ra te for short maturities is 
determined by the supply of and demand for short -term funds. Long -term interest rates are 
those that equate the sums that investors wish to lend long term with the amounts that 
borrowers are seeking on a long -term basis.  
Accordin g to market segmentation theory, investors and borrowers do not consider their 
short -term investments or borrowings as substitutes for long -term ones. This lack of 
substitutability keeps interest rates of differing maturities independent of one another. If  
investors or borrowers considered alternative maturities as substitutes, they may switch 
between maturities. However, if investors and borrowers switch between maturities in 
response to interest rate changes, interest rates for different maturities would no longer be 
independent of each other. An interest rate change for one maturity would affect demand 
andsupply, and hence interest rates, for other maturities.  
2.4.4.  The preferred habitat theory  
Preferred habitat theory is a variation on the market segmentation theory. The preferred 
habitat theory allows for some substitutability between maturities. However the preferred 
habitat theory views that interest premiums are needed to entice investors from their 
preferred maturities to other maturities.  
According to th e market segmentation and preferred habitat explanations, government can 
have a direct impact on the yield curve. Governments borrow by selling bills and bonds of 
various maturities. If government borrows by selling long -term bonds, it will push up 
long-term interest rates (by pushing down long -term bond prices) and cause the yield 
curve to be more upward sloping (or less downward sloping). If the borrowing were at the 
short maturity end, short -term interest rates would be pushed up.  
Question   
 What factors  influence the shape of the yield curve?  
2.5. Forward interest rates and yield curve  
The expectations that are relevant to investment decisions are expectations relative to 
market expectations. An active portfolio manager bases investment decisions on attempts  
to forecast interest rates more accurately than the average participant in the money market. 
For this reason the manager of an actively managed bond portfolio needs to be able to 
ascertain the market consensus forecast. Such market expectations can be ded uced from 
forward interest rates.  
Forward interest rates  are rates for periods commencing at points of time in the future. 
They are implied by current rates for differing maturities. For example, the current 3 -
month interest rate and the current 6 -month in terest rate between them imply a rate for a 3 -
month period which runs from a point in time three months from the present until a point 
in time six months hence.  
The forward 3 -month rate for a period commencing three months from the present is the 
rate whic h, when compounded on the current 3 -month rate, would yield the same return as 
the current 6 -month rate. For example if the 3 -month rate is 9% p.a. and the 6 -month rate 
is 10% p.a., the forward rate is shown as x in equation:  
(1,0225)(1 + x) =1,05   27 The forw ard rate is calculated as:  
x=(1,05/1.0225) - 1 = 0,0269  
which is 2.69% over three months and hence 10.76% p.a.  
The forward rate can be interpreted as the market expectation of the future interest rate 
under the assumptions that:  the expectations theory o f the yield curve is correct and there 
is no risk premium. If the expectations theory is seen as a good model, but there is a risk 
premium, an adjustment is required to remove the effects of the risk premium before the 
result can be interpreted as the mark et forecast of the future interest rate.  
 
Question   
 What is the meaning of the forward rate in the context of the 
term structure of interest rates?  
The yield curve  based on zero coupon bonds is known as the spot yield curve . It is 
regarded as more infor mative than a yield curve that relates redemption yields to 
maturities of coupon bearing bonds. The redemption date is not the only maturity date.  
 
Example  
 The one -year interest rate is 6,5% p.a. and the six -month 
interest rate is 6% p.a. What is the fo rward six -month 
interest rate for the period between six months and one year 
from now? Can this forward interest rate be taken to be the 
interest rate expected by money market participants?  
Let x be the forward interest rate p.a. (so that the rate for six 
months is x/2).  
(1,03)(1 + x/2) =1,065  
1 +x/2 =(1,065)/(1,03)  
x/2 =[(1,065)/(1,03)] -1 
x=2{ [(1,065)/(1,03)] -1} 
Therefore x=0,068, i.e. 6,8% p.a.  
The forward interest rate of 6,8% p.a. can be taken to be the 
market expectation if the expectations theory o f the yield 
curve is correct and there is no risk premium. If the 
expectations theory is correct but there is a risk premium, the 
risk premium must be removed before carrying out the 
calculation. Suppose that the six -month rate contains no risk 
premium, bu t the one -year rate contains a risk premium of 
0,1% p.a. The one -year interest rate, net of the risk premium, 
is 6,4% p.a. The new calculation would be as follows:  
(1,03)(1 + x/2) = (1,064)  
x=2{[(1,064)/(1,03)] -1} 
Therefore x=0,066, i.e. 6,6% p.a.  
Coupo n-bearing bonds may have differing redemption yields, despite having common 
redemption dates, because of differences in the coupon payments. Yield curves based on 
coupon -bearing bonds may not provide a single redemption yield corresponding to a 
redemption (final maturity) date.   28 Example  
 Suppose, z ero coupon bonds with maturities one, two, and 
three years from the present have prices of 95, 88, and 80 
Euro.  What are the spot one -, two -, and three -year interest 
rates?  Draw the yield curve.  
In the case of th e one -year bond, an investment of 95 Euro 
entails a receipt of 100 Euro in one year. 100/95 =1,0526 
which implies a spot one -year interest rate of 5,26%. In the 
case of the two -year bond, an investment of 88 Euro yields a 
receipt of 100 Euro after two year s. 
100/88 =1,13636  
√1,13636 =1,0660 or a spot 2-year interest rate of 6,60% p.a.  
b) In the case of the three -year bond, an investment of 80 
Euro provides a receipt of 100 Euro after three years.  
100/80 = 1,25  
1,250.33=1,0772 or a spot three -year interest r ate of 7,72% p.a.  
The forward yield curve  relates forward interest rates to the points of time to which they 
relate. For example, rates of return on five -year bonds and rates on four -year bonds imply 
rates on one year instruments to be entered into four years from the present. The implied 
forward rate can be calculated by means of the formula:  
(1 + 4r1) = (1 + 0r5)5 / (1 + 0r4)4  
where r 5 is the five -year interest rate, r 4 is the four -year interest rate, and 4r1 is the one -year 
rate expected in four years’  time.  
This formula arises from the relation:  
(1 + 0r5)5=(1 + 0r4)4 (1 +  4r1)  
which states that a five -year investment at the five -year interest rate should yield the same 
final sum as a four -year investment at the four -year rate with the proceeds reinves ted for 
one year at the one -year rate expected to be available four years hence. The value of 4r1 
would be related to the point in time, of four years, on the yield curve. Carrying out such a 
calculation for a succession of future periods produces a series  of forward interest rates.  
Question   
 Why might forward rates consistently overestimate future 
interest rates?  
 
Question   
 How liquidity premium affects the estimate of a forward 
interest rate?  
When plotted against their respective dates, the series of  forward rates produces a forward 
yield curve. The forward yield curve requires the use of zero coupon bonds for the 
calculations.  
This forms also the basis for calculation of short -term interest rate futures. Short -term 
interest rate futures, which freque ntly take the form of three -month interest rate futures, 
are instruments suitable for the reduction of the risks of interest rate changes. Three -month 
interest rate futures are notional commitments to borrow or deposit for a three -month 
period that commenc es on the futures maturity date. They provide means whereby  29 borrowers or investors can (at least approximately) predetermine interest rates for future 
periods.  
Example  
 Assume that the three -month interest rate is 4.5% p.a. and 
the six -month interest rate  is 5% p.a.  
What is the forward interest rate for the three -month period 
commencing three months from now?  
5% p.a. is 2,5% over six months, and 4,5% p.a. is 1,125% 
over three months.  
(1,025)/(1,01125) = 1,013597  
1.013597 - 1 = 0.013597, i.e. 1.3597% for t hree months or 
5.44% p.a. (to two decimal places).  
The forward interest rate is 5,44% p.a.  
 
2.6. Summary  
Level of interest rates in an economy is explained by two key economic theories: the 
loanable funds theory and the liquidity preference theory. The loanabl e funds theory states 
that the level of interest rates is determined by the supply of and demand for loanable 
funds. According to the liquidity preference theory, the level of interest rates is determined 
by the supply of and demand for money balances.  
Interest rates in the economy are determined by the base rate (rate on a Government 
security) plus a risk premium (or a spread). There are several factors that determine the 
risk premium for a non - Government security, as compared with the Government security  
of the same maturity.  These are (1) the perceived creditworthiness of the issuer, (2) 
provisions of securities such as conversion provision, call provision, put provision, (3) 
interest taxes, and (4) expected liquidity of a security’s issue.  
The term str ucture of interest rates shows the relationship between the yield on a bond and 
its maturity. The yield curve describes the relationship between the yield on bonds of the 
same credit quality but different maturities in a graphical way.  Apart from spot rat es, 
forward rates provide additional information for issuers and investors. The major theories 
explain the observed shapes of the yield curve are the expectations theory, liquidity 
premium, market segmentation theory and preferred habit theory.

Review questions and problems  
 How would you expect an increase in the propensity to save to affect the 
general level of interest rates in an economy?  
6. Explain how an increase in the rate of inflation might affect (a) real interest 
rates and (b) nominal interest rates.  
7. Why are some lend ers capital risk averse and others income risk averse? What 
slope will the yield curve have when the market is dominated by capital risk 
aversion?  
8. Why might interest rates payable on long -term, ‘risk -free’ government bonds 
include a term premium?  
9. Look at t he most recent interest rate change by European Central bank, US 
FED, Bank of England, Central Bank of Lithuanian, Central Bank of Latvia and 
Central Bank of Estonia. Compare them. What conclusions can be drawn?  
10.What conclusion might you draw about possibl e future interest rates if a 
positive term premium were to increase?  
11.Why might interest rate movements of various developed countries be more 
highly correlated in recent years than in earlier years?   31 12.Consider the prevailing conditions for inflation (includi ng oil prices), the 
economy, and the budget deficit, the central bank of your country and EU 
central bank monetary policy that could affect interest rates. Based on the 
prevailing conditions, do you think interest rates will likely increase during the 
following half a year? Provide arguments for your answer. Which factor do you 
think will have the largest impact on interest rates?  
13.Assume that a) investors and borrowers expect that the economy will weaken 
and that inflation will decline; b) investors require  a low liquidity premium; c) 
markets are partially segmented and the Government prefers to borrow in the 
short -term markets. Explain how each of the three factors would affect the term 
structure of interest rates, holding all other factors constant. Then e xplain the 
overall effect on the term structure.  
14.Assume that the yield curves in the US, Germany and Japan are flat. If the yield 
curve in the US suddenly becomes positively sloped, do you think the yield 
curves in Germany and Japan would be affected? If y es, how?  
15.A company X has funded its operations by bank loans extensively. The interest 
rate on the loans is tied to the market interest rates and is adjusted every six 
months. Thus the cost of funds is sensitive to interest rate movements. Because 
of expec tations that EU economy would strengthen during the next year, the 
company plans further growth through investments. The company expects that it 
will need substantial long -term financing to finance its growth and plans to 
borrow additional funds in the deb t market.  
a) What can be the company’s expectations about the change in interest rates 
in the future? Why?  
b) How would these expectations affect the company’s cost of borrowing on its 
existing loans and on future debt?

borrow funds and whether to issue floating -rate or fixed rate debt?  
16. Assume that the interest rate for one year securities is expected to be 4 percent

only the pure expectations theory find what are the current (spot) interest rates 
on two and three year securities.  
17. Assume that the spot (annualized) interest rate on a three year security is 8 
percent, while the spot (annualized) interest rate on a two year s ecurity is 5 
percent. Use only this information to estimate the one year forward rate two 
years from now.  
18.Assume that the spot (annualized) interest rate on a two year security is 7 
percent, while the spot (annualized) interest rate on a one year security is 6 
percent.

the shape of the yield curve, provide your explanations of the differen ce 
between the 1 year and the 30 year government securities. Which theory 
according to your opinion is the most reasonable? Why?   32 20.Consider how quickly other interest rates in the economy changed thereafter. 
Why does the MPC change interest rates each time i t acts by only 1/4 or, at 
most, 1/2 a per cent?  
21.Could the MPC of the Bank of England raise interest rates when everyone was 
expecting them to fall? Look at the financial press and find the current interest 
spread between five -year and ten -year government b onds. Is there a positive 
term premium?  
22.What conclusion might you draw about possible future interest rates if a 
positive term premium were to increase? How is money actually transferred 
from an account in one country to an account in another?

 Money markets segments and participants  
 Money market instruments  
 Money market rates  and yields  
 
3.1. Money market purpose and structure  
3.1.1.  The role of money markets  
The purpose of money markets  is facilitate the transfer of short -term funds from agents 
with excess funds (corporations, financial institutions, individuals, government) to those 
market participants who lack funds for short -term needs.  
They play central role in the country’s financial system, by influencing it through the 
country’s monetary autho rity.   
For financial institutions and to some extent to other non -financial companies money 
markets allow for executing such functions as:  
 Fund raising;  
 Cash management;  
 Risk management;  
 Speculation or position financing;  
 Signalling;  
 Providing access to i nformation on prices.  
Money markets are wholesale markets with very large amounts of transactions, e.g. with 
transactions from 500 million Euro to 1 billion Euro or even larger ones. This is the most 
active financial market in terms of volumes of trading.  
From the start of emergence the traditional money markets performed the role of 
monetary policy . In order to influence the supply side, governments have employed 
methods of direct regulation and control of the savings and investment behaviour of 
individual s and companies. However due to fast technological advances, 
internationalization and liberalization of financial markets, possibilities to carry out policy 
objectives through such measures have diminished. Current policy through market -
oriented measures i s aimed primarily at demand side. Thus money markets serve the 
interface between execution of monetary policy and the national economies   
Another role of domestic money markets is to serve public policy objectives, i.e. 
financing public sector deficits an d managing the accumulated government deficits. 
Government public debt policy is an important determinant of the money markets 
operations, since government debt typically forms a key part of the country’s money 
markets (as well as debt markets). The scope and measures of monetary policy are also 
linked to the government’s budget and fiscal policies. Thus the country’s money market  34 shifts are dependant upon the goals of national public policy and tools used to reach these 
goals.  
 Changes in the role and stru cture of money markets were also influenced by 
financial deregulation, which evolved as a result of recognition that excessive controls are 
not compatible with efficient resource allocation, with solid and balanced growth of 
economies. Money markets went t hrough passive adaptation as well as through active 
influence from the side of governments and monetary authorities.  
Finally, money markets were influenced by such international dimensions as 
increasing capital mobility, changing exchange rate arrangements , diminishing monetary 
policy autonomy. The shifts  in European domestic money markets were made by the 
European integration process, emergence and development of European monetary union.   
 
3.1.2.   Money market segments  
In a broad sense, money market  consists of the market for short -term funds, usually with 
maturity up to one year. It can be divided into several major segments:  
Interbank market , where banks and non -deposit financial institutions settle 
contracts with each other and with central bank, involving tem porary liquidity surpluses 
and deficits.  
Primary market , which is absorbing the issues and enabling borrowers to raise 
new funds.  
Secondary market  for different short -term securities, which redistributes the 
ownership, ensures liquidity, and as a result, i ncreases the supply of lending and reduces 
its price.  
Derivatives market – market for financial contracts whose values are derived 
from the underlying money market instruments.  
Interbank market  is defined mainly in terms of participants, while other market s are 
defined in terms of instruments issued and traded. Therefore there is a considerable 
overlap between these segments. Interbank market is referred mainly as the market for 
very short deposits and loans, e.g. overnight or up to two weeks. Nearly all ty pes of money 
market instruments can be traded in interbank market.  
Key money market segments by instruments are provided in Figure 6 
 
Figure 6. Key money market instruments  
 
The money -market instruments are o ften grouped in the following way:  
 Treasury bills and other short -term government securities (up to one year);   35  Interbank loans, deposits and other bank liabilities;  
 Repurchase agreements and similar collateralized short -term loans;  
 Commercial papers, issue d by non -deposit entities (non -finance companies, finance 
companies, local government, etc. ;  
 Certificates of deposit;  
 Eurocurrency instruments;  
 Interest rate and currency derivative instruments.  
All these instruments have slightly different characteristic s, fulfilling the demand of 
investors and borrowers for diversification in terms of risk, rate of return, maturity and 
liquidity, and also diversification in terms of sources of financing and means of payment. 
Many investors regard individual money market instruments as close substitutes, thus 
changes in all money market interest rates are highly correlated.  
Major characteristics of money market instruments  are:  
 short -term nature;  
 low risk;  
 high liquidity (in general);  
 close to money.  
Money markets consis t of tradable instruments  as well as non-tradable instruments . 
Traditional money markets instruments, which included mostly dealing of market 
participants with central bank, have decreased their importance during the recent period, 
followed by an increasin g trend to finance short -term needs by issuing new types of 
securities such as REPOs, commercial papers or certificates of deposit. The arguments 
behind the trend are the following:  
1. An observed steady shift to off -balance sheet instruments, as a reaction t o 
introduction of capital risk management rules for internationally operating banks in 
the recommendations of Basel II Accord and EU Directives on banking.  
2. Advantages provided to high -rated m arket participants, allowing to diversify 
borrowing sources, to c ut the costs, to reduce the borrowers’ dependence on 
banking sector lending and its limitations.  
In terms of risk two specific money -market segments  are: 
 unsecured debt instruments markets (e.g. deposits with various maturities, ranging 
from overnight to o ne year);  
 secured debt instruments markets (e.g. REPOs) with maturities also ranging from 
overnight to one year.  
Differences in  amount of risk  are characteristic to the secured and the unsecured 
segments of the money markets. Credit risk is minimized by li miting access to high -quality 
counter -parties. When providing unsecured interbank deposits, a bank transfers funds to 
another bank for a specified period of time during which it assumes full counterparty credit 
risk. In the secured REPO markets, this count erparty credit risk is mitigated as the bank 
that provides liquidity receives collateral (e.g., bonds) in return.  
Money markets structures differ across the countries, depending upon regulatory and 
legislative frameworks, factors that have supported or li mited the development of such  36 national markets. The influence of business culture and traditions, industrial structures 
have played an important role also.  
Economic significance of money markets is predetermined by its size, level of 
development of infras tructure, efficiency. Growth of government securities issues, their 
costs considerations, favourable taxation policies have become additional factors boosting 
some of the country’s money markets.  
 
3.1.3.  Money market participants  
Money market participants  includ e mainly credit institutions and other financial 
intermediaries, governments, as well as individuals (households).   
Ultimate lenders in the money markets are households and companies with a financial 
surplus which they want to lend, while ultimate borrower s are companies and government 
with a financial deficit which need to borrow. Ultimate lenders and borrowers usually do 
not participate directly in the markets. As a rule they deal through an intermediary, who 
performs functions of broker, dealer or invest ment banker.  
Important role is played by government , which issue money market securities and use the 
proceeds to finance state budget deficits. The government debt is often refinanced by 
issuing new securities to pay off old debt, which matures. Thus it ma nages to finance long -
term needs through money market securities with short -term maturities.  
Central bank  employs money markets to execute monetary policy. Through monetary 
intervention means and by fixing the terms at which banks are provided with money, 
central banks ensure economy’s supply with liquidity.  
Credit institutions  (i.e., banks) account for the largest share of the money market. They 
issue money market securities to finance loans to households and corporations, thus 
supporting household purchas es and investments of corporations. Besides, these 
institutions rely on the money market for the management of their short -term liquidity 
positions and for the fulfilment of their minimum reserve requirements.  
Other important market participants are other  financial intermediaries, such as money 
market funds , investment funds  other than money -market funds, insurance companies  and 
pension funds . 
Large non-financial corporations  issue money market securities and use the proceeds to 
support their current opera tions or to expand their activities through investments.  
In general issuance of money market securities allow market participants to increase their 
expenditures and finance economic growth.  
Money market securities are purchased mainly by corporations, fin ancial intermediaries 
and government that have funds available for a short -term period. . Individuals (or 
households) play a limited role in the market by investing indirectly through money 
market funds. Apart from transactions with the central bank, money -market participants 
trade with each other to take positions dependant upon their short -term interest rate 
expectations, to finance their securities trading portfolios (bonds, shares, etc.), to hedge 
their  longer -term positions with short -term contracts, and to reduce individual liquidity 
imbalances   37 3.2. Money market instruments  
3.2.1.  Treasury bills and other government securities  
Treasury bills are short -term money market instruments issued by government and backed 
by it. Therefore market participant view these gov ernment securities as having little or 
even no risk. The interest rates on Treasury securities serve as benchmark default -free 
interest rates. A typical life to maturity of the securities is from four weeks to 12 months. 
As they do not have a specified cou pon, they are in effect zero -coupon instruments and are 
issued at a discount to their par or nominal value, at which price they are redeemed. Any 
new issue with the same maturity date as an existing issue is regarded as a new tranche of 
the existing securi ty.  
Question  
 What are key characteristics of Treasury bills?  
Treasury bills are typically issued at only certain maturities dependant upon the 
government budget deficit financing requirements. Budget deficits create a challenge for 
the government. Large  volumes of Treasury securities have to be sold each year to cover 
annual deficit, as well as the maturing Treasury securities, that were issued in the past. The 
mix of Treasury offerings determines the maturity structure of the government’s debt.  
Primary  market.  The securities are issued via a regularly scheduled auction  process. 
Upon the Treasury’s announcement of the size of upcoming auction, tenders or sealed bids 
are being solicited.  
Concept  
 A tender  is a sealed bid.  
Bidders are submitting two type s of bids: competitive and non -competitive. A competitive 
bidder  specifies both the amount of the security that the bidder wants to buy, as well as 
the price that the bidder wants to pay. The price is set in terms of yield. The price of the 
securities in t he auction is set based on the prices offered in competitive bids, taking the 
average of all accepted competitive prices. Not all competitive bids that are tendered are 
accepted. Typically the longer the maturity, the greater would be the percentage of 
accepted bids. The percentage of accepted bids is determined by the size of the issue as 
compared to the amount of bids tendered. Competitive bidders are the largest financial 
institutions that generally purchase largest amounts of Treasury securities. In gen eral 80 -
90% Treasury securities are sold to them.  
A non- competitive bidder  specifies only the amount of the security that the bidder wants 
to buy, without providing the price, and automatically pay the defined price. Non -
competitive bidders are retail cus tomers, who purchase low volumes of the issues, and are 
not enough sophisticated to submit a bid price. Limits on each non -competitive bid can be 
set. Direct purchases of Treasury securities by individuals are limited in many countries. In 
such cases they use the services of dealers.  
The Figure 7 illustrates the results of sealed bid (tender) auction. The Treasury will accept 
the competitive bids with the highest price and lowest interest rates, and will reject other 
bids.  
Depending u pon the existing regulation in a specific country treasury security auctions can 
be organized and held at the central bank or stock exchanges.  
There are two  auction forms:  
 Uniform price auction , when all bidders pay the same price;   38  Discriminatory price auc tion, in which each bidder pays the bid price.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7.  Prices in a sealed -bid auction  
The procedure of the discriminatory price auction  one is more sophisticated. At first, all 
the non -competitive bids are tot aled, and their sum is subtracted from the total issue 
amount. This way all non -competitive bids are fulfilled. The price, which non -competitive 
bidders are going to pay, is determined taking into account the results of the competitive 
part of the auction.  
Concept  
 Uniform price auction  is an auction, when all bidders pay 
the same price.  
 
Concept  Discriminatory price auction  is an auction, in which each 
bidder pays the bid price.  
Further on, all competitive tenders are ranked in order of the bid yield. In  order to 
minimize the governments borrowing costs, the lowest competitive bid is accepted first. 
As a result, the highest bid prices are accepted until the issue is sold out fully. The lowest 
rejected bid yield (or the highest accepted bid yield) is calle d stop yield . The 
corresponding price is called the stop-out price .  
During such a Treasury auction, each competitive bidder pays the price for the securities, 
which is determined by the yield that was bid.  The average yield  is the average of all 
accepted  competitive bids, weighted by the amounts allocated at each yield. All non -
competitive bidders pay the average yield.  Supply curve  Price

 a tail  – the difference between the stop yield and the average yield;  
 a cover  – the rati o between the total amount competitive and non -competitive bids 
tendered and the total issue (i.e. the total amount of accepted bids). .  
A large cover indicates active market participation in an auction. Average cover can be 
evaluated in terms of a differ ence between maximum and minimum accepted bid yields (in 
basis points) A small tail shows that most competitive bidders provide similar evaluation 
of Treasury security issue, and thus pay nearly the same price for it. The larger the cover 
and the smaller t he tail, the more efficient is the Treasury auction.  
Concept  
 Basis point  is a very fine measure of interest rates, equal to 
one hundredth of one percentage point.  
In a discriminatory price auction the bidder’s price is determined by his own tender. A low  
bid, i.e. low yield and high offered price, increases the bidder’s chance of his bid to be 
accepted. However, this can lead to the possibility of the winner’s curse . In such a case 
the low bidder’s tender is accepted, but he pays a price that is higher th an of others lower 
priced (or higher yield) bids. Therefore competitive bidders may be reluctant to submit low 
bids, because this will oblige them to pay high prices for newly issued securities. This is a 
problem of discriminatory price auction.  
Concept  
 Winner’s curse  is the case, when the low bidder wins 
acceptance of the tender, but pays a price, which is higher 
than that of other lower bidders.  
A uniform price auction (or a Dutch auction)  does not have a problem of this kind. All the 
procedures of the  auction except for the last one are the same as in the discriminatory price 
auction. Each accepted bid pays the price of the lowest accepted bid.  
As a result, uniform price auction becomes more expensive to the Treasury and it receives 
lower revenue. Besi des, the average bidder may bid a higher price, shifting demand curve 
to right with the possibility offsetting the negative effect to the Treasury (see  Figure 8).

price. This may encourage greater participation in the auction, and finally increase the 
auction’s cover indicator. Competitive bidders are  not afraid to submit too low bids, 
because they will not be paying the price they bid. Conversely, the lower they will bid, the 
higher likelihood is that their bid will be accepted. As a result, bidders tend to reduce their 
bids, thereby lowering the aver age yield on the entire issue. Such changes in bidder 
behaviour may offset the direct effect of higher issuer’s interest costs in the uniform price 
auction.  
While evaluating the effectiveness of the Treasury auction method, there is a concern, that 
competi tive as well as non -competitive bidders can be neglected, while few large financial 
institutions may be favoured. This can cause decline in auction participation, undermining 
the Treasury’s abilities to place large amounts of securities. On the other hand,  since 
bidders do not pay their tendered prices, the uniform price auction may be more subject to 
manipulation or collusion by informed bidders.   
Question  
 What is the role of competitive and non -competitive bidders 
in the Treasury securities auction?  
Secondary market.  Typically the Treasury securities have an active and liquid secondary 
market. The most actively traded issues, which are usually the ones sold through an 
auction most recently, are called on-the-run issues . They have narrower bid -ask spread s 
than older, off -the-run issues. The role of brokers and dealers is performed by financial 
institutions. As a rule, competitive bidders can submit more than one bid to each auction, 
with different prices and quantities on each tender. However, in well dev eloped markets 
limitations are being placed to the amount of securities in each auction allocated to a 
particular single bidder. The aim of such a rule is to prevent market from influence of a 
single bidder, and thus squeezing other financial institutions with their own customers.  
Question  
 What is the role of competitive and non -competitive bidders 
in the Treasury securities auction?  
The text then can follow (starting with the style of the first paragraph). Then, we can have 
some readings or an example. I t can be but in the same format as the Concept/Check 
Question.  
Price of a Treasury bill  is the price that an investor will pay for a particular maturity 
Treasury security, depending upon the investor’s required return on it. The price is 
determined as the present value of the future cash flows to be received. Since the Treasury 
bill does not generate interest payments, the value of it is the present value of par value. 
Therefore, since the Treasury bill does not pay interest, investors will pay a price for a 
one-year security that will ensure that the amount they receive one year later will generate 
the desired return.  
Example  
 Assume investor requires a 5 percent annualized return on a 
one-year Treasury bill with a 100000Euro par value. He will  
be willing  to pay the price  
P = 100000 Euro / 1,05 = 95238 Euro  
If investor requires a return higher than 5 percent, he will 
discount the par value at a higher return rate. This will result 
in a lower price to be paid today.   41  
In case the maturity of Treasury bill is shorter than one year, then the annualized return 
will be reduced by the fraction of the year, during which the investment is made.  The 
simplified calculations are provided in the example below.  
Example  
 Assume investor requires a 5 percent annualized  return on a 6 
month Treasury bill with a 100000 Euro par value. The price 
of the security will be  
P = 100000 Euro / ( 1 +  0,05 / 2) =  
= 100000 Euro / ( 1 + 0,025) = 97560,9 Euro  
If investor requires a return higher than 5 percent, he will 
discount the par value at a higher return rate. This will result 
in a lower price to be paid today.  
The price of the Treasury bill calculated on discount rate basis is:  
P = PAR  x  (1 - (d x n / 360))  
where d is the yield or rate of discount, PA R is par or maturity val ue and n is the number 
of days of the investment (holding period).  
Example  
 Assume investor requires an 8 percent annualized return on a 
91-day Treasury bill with a 100000 Euro par value. The price 
of the security will be  
P = 100000 Euro x ( 1 – (0,08 x 91/ 360) =  
= 100000 Euro x ( 1 –  0,02 ) = 98000 Euro  
If investor requires a return higher than 5 percent, he will 
discount the par value at a higher return rate. This will result 
in a lower price to be paid today.  
Yield of a Treasury bill  is determined taking into account the difference between the 
selling price and the purchase price. Since Treasury bills do not offer coupon payments, 
the yield the investor will receive if he purchases the security and holds it until maturity 
will be equal to the return  based on difference between par value and the purchase price. 
The annualized yield on Treasury bill  is calculated in the following way:  
y = (PA R - P) / P x (365/n)  
where d is the yield, PA R – par value, P - purchase price of the  Treasury bill  and n is th e 
number of days of the investment (holding period).  
Example  
 Assume investor requires pays 98000 Euro for a 91 -day 
Treasury bill with a 100000 Euro par value. The annualized 
yield of the security will be  
y = (100000 – 98000) / 98000 ) x ( 365 / 91 )  =  
= 0,02 x 4,01 = 0,0802 or 8,02 %.  
If the Treasury bill is sold prior to maturity, the return is calculated on the basis of 
difference between the price for which the bill was sold in the secondary market and the 
purchase price.  
The annualized yield on Treasury bill  is calculated in the following way:  
y = (SP  - P) / P x (365/n)   42 where d is the yield, SP  – selling price, P - purchase price of the  Treasury bill  and n is the 
number of days of the investment (holding period).  
In some countries (e.g. US) Treasu ry bills are quoted on a discount rate (or referred to as 
Treasury bill rate) basis. The Treasury bill discount rate represents the percent discount of 
the purchase price from par value of a new issue of a Treasury bill. It is determined in the 
following w ay: 
d = (PA R - P) / PA R x (360/n)  
where d is the yield, PA R – par value, P - purchase price of the  Treasury bill  and n is the 
number of days of the investment (holding period).  
In such a case the year is assumed having 360 days, and the number of days of the 
investment can be actual or an assumed convention. If a newly issued Treasury bill is held 
until maturity, then its yield is always greater than rate of discount. The difference is due 
to price or value used in denominator, since purchase price is alwa ys lower than par value. 
Besides, the yield is always calculated on 365 day during a year basis.  
 
3.2.2.  The interbank market loans  
Interbank market is a market through which banks lend to each other.  
Commercial banks are required to keep reserves on deposits w ithin central bank. Banks 
with reserves in excess of required reserves can lend these funds to other banks. 
Traditionally this formed the basis of the interbank market operations. However, currently 
these operations involve lending any funds in reserve acc ounts at a central bank.  
Concept  
 Interbank market is a market which involves bank 
borrowing and lending of any funds in reserve accounts at the 
central bank.  
In US the interbank market is the federal funds  market, which involves the borrowing and 
lendi ng any funds in reserve accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank (FED).  
The major characteristics  of the interbank markets are:  
 The transfer of immediately available funds;  
 Short time horizons;  
 Unsecured transfers.  
Individual banks have a possibility to invest  (lend)  surplus funds and have a source of 
borrowing when their reserves are low, thus they manage their reserve position and fund 
their assets portfolio by trading at the interbank market. This is a wholesale market with 
deals usually in large denominatio ns. It is used by all types of banks, involved in loans for 
very short periods, from overnight to fourteen days mostly. Then bank borrows in the 
interbank market, it is said to be a funds buyer. When bank lends immediately available 
reserve accounts, it is  said to be a seller. Most banks simultaneously buy and sell funds all 
the time. By acting as dealers they make markets for funds by announcing willingness to 
buy or to sell at the current competitive interbank rate.  
The interbank interest rates and intere st rates in the traditional market are interconnected. 
If banks are short of liquidity they will lend less to both markets and will cause interest 
rates to rise. When Central bank provides funds to the discount market, less attractive 
terms are offered by banks. Thus they may choose other markets to invest and will cause 
the drop in interest rates.   43 Interbank rates are generally slightly higher and more volatile than interest rates in the 
traditional market. In periods of great shortage of liquidity, the ne eds of banks which do 
not have sufficient funds to meet the central bank requirements drive up the overnight rates 
significantly.  
To keep up the speed of the transfer and the costs of transfer down, the interbank market 
transfers are unsecured, i.e. not b acked by any collateral and have no protection against 
default by the borrowing bank.  
Credit risk in the interbank market is controlled through the interbank rate, which is truly 
competitive, quoted market rate. It is determined entirely by the supply and demand of 
banks for funds. Since the market is a closed interbank system, the aggregate value of all 
buy orders (demand for funds) should be equal to the aggregate value of all sell orders 
(supply of funds). If the demand for fund purchases increases, it d rives up the interbank 
interest rate.  
Question  
 How is interbank interest rate determined?  
Participants in the interbank market typically undertake two types of transactions : 
 reserve management transactions;  
 portfolio management transactions.  
Bank reserv e management transactions allow complying with contemporaneous bank 
reserve requirements.  
Through portfolio management transactions banks use interbank market to finance their 
assets’ portfolio. These are encouraged by the interbank market liquidity and f lexibility. 
With time horizons as short as overnight, the transactions can be made rapidly at low 
transaction costs.  
Unlike other instruments ‘traded’ in the money markets, interbank deposits are not 
negotiable i.e. do not have a secondary market. A lendi ng bank which wishes to retrieve its 
funds simply withdraws the deposit from the bank to which it was lent. Thus, In this case, 
the distinction between primary and secondary markets is irrelevant.  
Question  
 How has the interbank interest rate volatility c hanged over 
the recent years? What is the major cause of this change?  
 
3.2.3.  Commercial papers  
Commercial paper (CP)  is a short -term debt instrument issued only by large, well 
known, creditworthy companies and is typically unsecured. The aim of its issuance is to 
provide liquidity or finance company’s investments, e.g. in inventory and accounts 
receivable.  
The major issuers  of commercial papers are financial institutions, such as finance 
companies, bank holding companies, insurance companies.  Financial compani es tend to 
use CPs as a regular source of finance. Non -financial companies tend to issue CPs on an 
irregular basis to meet special financing needs.  
Thus commercial paper is a form of short -term borrowing. Its initial maturity is usually 
between seven and f orty-five days. In US, the advantage of issuing CPs with maturities 
less than nine months is that they do not have to register with the Securities Exchange  44 Commission (SEC) as a public offering. This reduces the costs of registration with SEC 
and avoids de lays related to the registration process.  
CPs can be sold directly by the issuer, or may be sold to dealers who charge a placement 
fee (e.g. 1/8 percent). Since issues of CPs are heterogeneous in terms of issuers, amounts, 
maturity dates, there is no activ e secondary market for commercial papers. However, 
dealers may repurchase CPs for a fee.  
Question  
 What is the role of financial institutions in the commercial 
paper market?  
The price of CP is calculated in the following way:  
P = PAR  x  (1 - (d x n / 360 )) 
where d is the yield or rate of discount, PA R is par or maturity value and n is the number 
of days of the investment (holding period).  
CP is sold at a discount to its maturity value, thus it is the other money market instrument 
whose return is expressed  on a discount basis.  
Example  
 A 30 day CP with 10 million Euro par value yields 4,75% . 
The price of this CP currently offering is equal to  
P = 10,0 million Euro  x  (1 - (0,0475 x 30 / 360)) =  
= 10,0 million Euro  x  (1 - 0,003) = 9,97 million Euro  
The yie ld on CP is calculated in the following way:  
d = (PA R - P) / PA R x (360/n)  
where d is the yield or rate of discount, PA R – par value, P - initial price of the  CP and n is 
the number of days of the investment (holding period).  
Example  
 Investor has purchas ed a 30 day CP with a par value of 1 
million Euro for a price of 990 000 Euro. What is the yield of 
this CP investment?  
d = ( 1 mil Euro  - 990 000 Euro) / 1 mil Euro  x (360/30) =  
= 0,01 x 12 = 0,12 or 12 %.  
Commercial paper is normally unsecured  against an y specific assets and firms wishing to 
use the commercial paper market will usually seek a credit rating from one or other of the 
credit rating agencies. A high rating will mean that such paper can be issued at a smaller 
discount, often amounting to the eq uivalent of 1 per cent. Although commercial paper is 
unsecured, typically it is backed by a line of credit at a commercial bank.  
As a source of finance, commercial paper serves a similar purpose to commercial bills 
(and is priced in the same way). Thus, i n countries with a highly developed discount, or 
bills, market, the market for commercial paper is relatively small (e.g. UK). However, 
when the commercial bill market is less developed, the commercial paper market is very 
large (e.g. France and US). The m ain difference between commercial papers and 
commercial bills lies in the manner of their creation. A firm borrows via a commercial bill 
when it agrees to ‘accept’ a bill which is ‘drawn’ by a creditor. The bill originates with the 
lender. A firm borrows v ia commercial paper when it issues the paper itself.  
Question  
 What are the substitutes for commercial paper?   45  
3.2.4.  Certificates of deposit  
Certificate of deposit (CD)  states that a deposit has been made with a bank for a fixed 
period of time, at the end of w hich it will be repaid with interest.  
Thus it is, in effect, a receipt for a time deposit and explains why CDs appear in definitions 
of the money supply such as M4. It is not the certificate as such that is included, but the 
underlying deposit, which is a  time deposit like other time deposits.  
An institution is said to ‘issue’ a CD when it accepts a deposit and to ‘hold’ a CD when it 
itself makes a deposit or buys a certificate in the secondary market. From an institution’s 
point of view, therefore, issue d CDs are liabilities; held CDs are assets.  
The advantage to the depositor  is that the certificate can be tradable. Thus though the 
deposit is made for a fixed period, he depositor can use funds earlier by selling the 
certificate to a third party at a pric e which will reflect the period to maturity and the 
current level of interest rates.  
The advantage to the bank  is that it has the use of a deposit for a fixed period but, 
because of the flexibility given to the lender, at a slightly lower price than it wo uld have 
had to pay for a normal time deposit.  
The minimum denomination can be 100 000USD, although the issue can be as large as 1 
million USD. The maturities of CDs usually range from two weeks to one year.  
Non-financial corporations usually purchase nego tiable CDs. Though negotiable CD 
denominations are typically too large for individual investors, they are sometimes 
purchased by money market funds that have pooled individual investors’ funds. Thus 
money market funds allow individuals to be indirect inves tors in negotiable CDs. This way 
the negotiable CD market can be more active. There is also a secondary market for these 
securities, however its liquidity is very low.  
Concept  
 Negotiable certificates of deposit  are certificates that are 
issued by large co mmercial banks and other depository 
institutions as a short -term source of funds.  
The negotiable CDs must be priced offering a premium above government securities (e.g. 
Treasury bills) to compensate for less liquidity and safety. The premiums are generall y 
higher during the recessionary periods. The premiums reflect also the money market 
participants’ understanding about the safety of the financial system.  
Question  
 What factors lead to rise / decline in certificates of deposit 
market?  
Negotiable CDs are  priced on a yield  basis. Institution issue negotiable CDs at a par value.  
Thus the yield of the security is calculated:  
y = ( PAR  –  P )/ P  x (360 / n)  
Example  
 A three -month CD for 100 000 Euro at 6 per cent matures in 
73 days. It is currently tradin g at 99 000 Euro. Rate of return 
of this CD current offering is  
y = (100 000   –  99 000  )/ 99 000  x (360 / 73) =  
=  0,01  x  4,93 = 0,0493 or 4,93%  
  46 The market price of the CD is found by discounting the par or maturity value by the rate of 
interest cu rrently available on similar assets, adjusted for the residual maturity.  
The price  of CDs is determined using the following equation:  
P = PAR / (1 – (i x n / 360))  
Question  
 Find the price of a three -month 150,000 Euro CD, paying 4 
per cent, if it has 36  days to maturity and short -term interest 
rates are 4 per cent.  
What will be the price of this same CD if short -term interest 
rates fall to 2 percent?  
The annualized yield they pay is the annualized interest rate on negotiable CDs. If 
investors purchase a nd holds negotiable CDs until maturity, their annualized yield is the 
interest rate. However, if investors purchase or negotiable CDs in the secondary market 
instead of holding them from issuance to maturity, then annualized yield can differ from 
the annua lized interest rate.  
y = (Selling Price – Purchase Price + Interest) / Purchase Price  
Example  
 An investor purchased a negotiable CD a year ago in a 
secondary market. He redeems it today upon maturity and 
receives 1 million Euro. He also receives 40000 Eu ro of 
interest. What is investor’s annualized yield on this 
investment?  
The interest rate paid on CDs is often linked to interbank rate. If LIBOR is 4,75 per cent, 
for example, the CD described above might be paying 5 percent because it is quoted as 
payin g LIBOR plus 25 basis points.  
Certificates of deposit are an alternative of short -term, wholesale lending and borrowing. 
Three - and six -month maturities are common. Some CDs are issued for one year and even 
for two years but the market for these is compar atively thin. This has led to the practice of 
banks issuing ‘roll -over’ CDs, i.e. six -month CDs with a guarantee of further renewal on 
specified terms. CDs are issued by a wide variety of banks. It is quite common for a bank 
both to have issued and to hold  CDs, though normally of differing maturities. It will issue 
CDs with a maturity expected to coincide with a liquidity surplus and hold CDs expected 
to mature at a time of shortage.  
 
3.2.5.  Repurchase agreements  
A repurchase agreement (REPO)  is an agreement to bu y any securities from a seller 
with the agreement that they will be repurchased at some specified date and price in the 
future.  
Concept  
 Repurchase agreement (REPO) is a fully collateralize loan 
in wich the collateral consists of marketable securities.  
In essence the REPO transaction represents a loan backed by securities. If the borrower 
defaults on the loan, the lender has a claim on the securities. Most REPO transactions use 
government securities, though some can involve such short -term securities as c ommercial 
papers and negotiable Certificates of Deposit.  
  47 Since the length of any repurchase agreement is short -term, a matter of months at most, it 
is usually assumed as a form of short -term finance and therefore, logically, an alternative 
to other money market transactions.  
Concept  
 Open REPO is a REPO agreement with no set maturity date, 
but renewed each day upon agreement of both counterparties.  
 
Concept  
 Term REPO is a REPO with a maturity of more than one 
day.  
A reverse REPO  transaction is a purch ase of securities by one party from another with the 
agreement to sell them. Thus a REPO and a reverse REPO can refer to the same 
transaction but from different perspectives and is used to borrow securities and to lend 
cash.  
The participants of REPO transa ctions are banks, money market funds, non -financial 
institutions. The transactions can amount 10 million in USD terms with the maturity from 
one to 15 days and for one, three, six months. There is no secondary market for REPOs  
Since the effect of the REPO transactions influence money market prices and yields, it is 
normal to regard such REPOs as money market deals. In a REPO, the seller is the 
equivalent of the borrower and the buyer is the lender. The repurchase price is higher than 
the initial sale price,  and the difference in price constitutes the return to the lender.  
The amount of REPO loan is determined in the following way:  
REPO principal = Securities market value x ( 1 – Haircut )  
Securities market value = PAR x ( 1 – (d x n / 360 ))  
where the secu rities market value is determined as the current market value of these 
securities, d is the rate of discount of the securities, n is term of the securities, PAR is the 
par value of the securities.  
In the REPO transaction securities market value is equal t o the value of collateral, against 
which the borrowing takes place. Since the value of the securities may be fluctuating 
during the term of , the amount of the loan (the principal) is less than the current market 
value of the securities.  
The deduction fro m current market value of the securities collateral required to do the 
REPO transaction is made, which is call a haircut  or a margin . The haircut is a margin 
stated in terms of basis points. A standard haircut can be, e.g. 25 basis points (or 
0,0025%). Thu s a REPO loan is overcollateralized loan meaning that the amount of the 
collateral exceeds the loan principal and the haircut.  
Repurchase of the securities is made by repaying REPO loan and interest:  
REPO principal + Interest = REPO principal ( 1 + (y x t  / 360 ))  
where y is the yield or rate of the REPO transaction, t is the term of the REPO transaction.  
REPO principal = Securities market value x (1 – Haircut)  
Securities market value is defined as present value of the par value of the securities 
involved in the transaction.  
Concept  
 Haircut  – the function of a broker/ dealer’s securities 
portfolio, that cannot be traded, but instead must be held as 
capital to act as a cushion against loss.   48  
The haircut or margin offers some protection to the lender in ca se the borrower goes 
bankrupt or defaults for some other reason. The size of the risk, and thus this haircut / 
margin, depends in large part upon the status of the borrower, but it also depends upon the 
precise nature of the contract. Some REPO deals are g enuine sales. In these circumstances, 
the lender owns the securities and can sell them in the case of default. In some REPO 
contracts, however, what is created is more strictly a collateralized loan with securities 
acting as collateral while remaining in t he legal ownership of the borrower. In the case of 
default, the lender has only a general claim on the lender and so the haircut / margin is 
likely to be greater.  
Example  
 Consider a 90 day REPO transaction, with a REPO rate of 
4,75%. 180 days government securities with a rate of 
discount of 5% and a par value of 10 million Euro are used as 
collateral. Assume that the haircut is equal to 25 basis points. 
What is the amount of REPO loan? What is the amount of 
REPO loan repayment in the transaction?  
REPO de als are quoted on a yield  basis. The rate is quoted as a simple interest yield on a 
360 days basis set upon initiation of the transaction and fixed for the term of REPO.  
The REPO rate or yield is calculated:  
y =  ( PAR – P ) / P x (360 / t )  
where P is the  purchase price, PAR is the agreed repurchase price and t is the period of the 
transaction.  
Example  
 Investor has purchased securities at a price of 9 980 000 
Euro, with an agreement to sell them back at 10 million Euro. 
At the end of 15 days period. What  is the yield of the 
transaction?  
REPO transactions have two legs: 1) when cash is borrowed against collateral; 2) when 
REPO transaction takes place, i.e. securities are repurchased by repaying REPO loan plus 
interest.  
The repurchase of the securities (RE PO payment) is completely independent from the 
market value of the securities on the maturity date of the REPO. This reinforces the 
economic reality that REPO transaction is a collateralized loan.  
In a reverse REPO transaction the reverse payment is calcul ated:  
Reverse principal + Interest = Reverse principal x ( 1 + (y x t / 360))  
where y is the yield or REPO rate, t is maturity of the reverse REPO.  
Example  
 Assume a financial institution utilizes a reverse REPO to 
borrow securities and to lend cash. The securities collateral is 
1 million of par value government securities paying 6% p.a. 
semi annually with 5 years to maturity. A REPO rate is 4,5%, 
181 day of maturity, with a 50 basis points of haircut. What is 
the amount of reverse REPO repayment of the tr ansaction?  
REPO and reverse REPO markets  as well as number of their participants have grown up 
tremendously, especially due to increased sensitivity to interest rate risk and the 
opportunity cost of holding idle cash.  
  49 Question  
 What determines the size  of the REPO principal? What 
determines the size of the REPO repayment?  
REPO transactions are negotiated through a telecommunications network. Dealers and 
REPO brokers perform the role of financial intermediaries to create REPO transactions fro 
the compan ies with funds deficit or excess funds, and receive a commission for such 
services. However, direct REPO transaction is executed, when there is a possibility to find 
counterparty for it.  
Market participants  include central banks, financial institutions, n on-financial 
corporations.  
Central banks conduct short -term REPO transactions on bonds of any residual maturity as 
a means of influencing money market interest rates. ‘  
Non-financial companies, private financial institutions are more likely to utilize rev erse 
REPOs to earn interest on their cash balances during the periods of high interest rates. 
Speculative REPO and reverse REPO transactions are attractive to financial institutions 
with the increased volatility of interest rates. Money market funds often take the other side 
of REPO transactions and hold reverses in their assets portfolios as flexible short -term 
investment vehicles. Individuals, owning shares in these funds, earn interest on the 
reverses. The fund managers may speculate on interest rate flu ctuations using REPOs and 
reverse REPOs without being subject to the limitations on speculative derivative 
transactions. Important participants of the REPO market are security dealers. They make 
markets by carrying inventories of marketable securities, and  can use these securities as 
collateral on REPO loans. Thus they can reduce the cost of financing, utile REPOs to take 
positions on interest rates, finance their securities portfolios.  
Interest yields for REPOs of different terms reflect a term structure of interest rates which 
is a market consensus on forecasted interest rates. The REPO rate is significantly lower 
than other money market rates, however higher than the rate of government securities. It is 
maintained by possibility to substitute different m oney market instruments. There is no 
REPO secondary market.  
 
3.2.6.  International money market securities  
Apart from variety of money market instruments which enable short -term lending and 
borrowing to take place in the domestic currency, in recent years some of the fastest 
growing markets have been the so -called eurocurrency markets. These are markets in 
which the borrowing and lending denominated in a currency of some other country takes 
place. In general, eurocurrency market instruments are the same as other mo ney market 
instruments. When such instruments are denominated in some other currency, they are 
identified as ‘euro -’, though it can be any currency (e.g. US dollars, or Japanese yen). The 
trading can also take place anywhere (in European countries or in Ne w York or Tokyo or 
Hong Kong).  
Concept  
 Eurocurrency instrument  is any instrument denominated in 
a currency which differs from that of the country in which it 
is traded.  
The factor contributing to the long -term development of eurocurrency business was t he 
ability of eurobanks to offer their services at more competitive rates than domestic 
institutions. ‘Eurobanks’ are banks which specialize in eurocurrency business. They 
channel funds between surplus and deficit units and, and thus  create assets and lia bilities  50 which are more attractive to end -users than if they dealt directly with each other, also they 
help to use funds which might otherwise lay idle.  
In the Eurodollar market banks channel the deposited funds to other companies which 
need to receive Eur odollar loans. The deposit and loan transactions are of large 
denominations, e.g. exceeding 1 million USD. Therefore only governments and largest 
corporations can participate in the market. The market growth was influenced greatly by 
Eurocurrency liabiliti es of financial institutions are the following:  
 Euro Certificates of deposits  
 Interbank placements  
 Time deposits  
 Call money  
Euro certificates of deposits (Euro CDs)  are negotiable deposits with a fixed time to 
maturity.  
Time deposits  are non negotiable dep osits with a fixed time to maturity. Due to illiquidity 
their yields tend to be higher than the yields on equivalent maturity of negotiable Euro 
certificates of deposits.  
Interbank placements are short -term, often overnight, interbank loans of Eurocurrency  
time deposits.  
Call money  are non negotiable deposits with a fixed maturity that can be withdrawn at any 
time.  
Eurocurrency assets  of financial institutions are the following:  
 Euro Commercial Papers (Euro CPs)  
 Syndicated Euroloans  
 Euronotes   
Euro Commerci al Papers (Euro CPs) are securitized short -term bearer notes issued by a 
large well -known corporation.  They are issued only by private corporations in short 
maturities with the aim to provide short -term investments with a broad currency choice for 
interna tional investors. Most issues are pure discount zero coupon debt securities with 
maturities from 7 to 365 days. Issuance may be conducted through an appointed panel of 
dealers.It can be resold in a highly liquid secondary market. The issuers should be high ly 
rated as Euro CPs are unsecured.  
Syndicated Euroloans are related to bank lending of Eurocurrency deposits to non -
financial companies with the need for funds. Since they are non -negotiable, banks used to 
hold the syndicated loans in their portfolios un til they mature. Due to their illiquidity, the 
loans are often made jointly by a group of lending banks, which is called a syndicate. The 
role of syndication is to share loan risks among the banks that members of the syndicate.  
Euronotes  are unsecuritized debt instruments, substitutes for non -negotiable Euroloans. 
They are short –term, most often up to one year. Floating rate notes (FRNs) offer a 
variable interest rate that is reset periodically, usually seminannually or quarterly, 
according to some predete rmined market interest rate (e.g. LIBOR). For a high rated issuer 
the interest rate can be set lower than LIBOR.  
  51 3.3. Money market interest rates and yields  
Short -term money market instruments have different interest rate and yield quoting 
conventions. The yie ld on short -term money market instruments is often calculated using 
simple interest as opposed to compound interest, and as a result is not directly comparable 
with the yields to maturity.  
Short -term government securities (Treasury bills), commercial pape rs are often quoted and 
traded on a ‘discount’ basis, while interbank loan rates, REPO rates are quoted on an “add -
on” basis.  
Besides, it is a convention in the US Treasury bills market to assume that a year has 360 
days, while if it is denominated in ste rling it has 365 days, even in a leap year. Short -term 
money market instruments frequently do not have a specified coupon and as a result 
investors in them obtain a return by buying them at a discount to their par or maturity 
value.  
Below is provide the co mparison of different money market rates and yields.  
 
1) Rate on a discount basis  
d =  ( PAR – P ) / PAR x (360 / t )  
where d is the yield on the basis of  rate of discount, PA R – par value, P – the purchase 
price of the  security and t is the number of days u ntil maturity.  
Discount is calculated in this case as a percent from par value. It also assumes a 360 days 
year.  
Example  A 90 day US dollar Treasury bill is issued at 99% of its par 
value. It will be redeemed at its par value (100 %) 90 days 
after issue. It is traded on a discount basis. The discount of 
this issue  is:  
d = (100 − 99) / 100 × 360 / 90 = 4%  
Note that in the US dollar money market a year is assumed to 
have 360 days.  
The discount is often converted into a yield so as to make it comparable with other money 
market instruments. This yield is often called a ‘m oney market yield’. Using the above 
example, the money market yield is just 4 × 100 /99 = 4 .0404 %.  
 
2) Add-on rate  
y =  ( PAR – P ) / P x (360 / t )  
where y is the yield on the basis of  add -on rate, PA R – par value, P - the purchase price of 
the security and  t is the number of days until maturity.  
Example  
 Assume 990 000 Euro is lent for a 90 day period at the add -
on rate. The par value is 1000 000 Euro.  
The annualized yield of the security at an add -on basis will be  
y = (1000000 – 990000) / 990000 ) x ( 3 60 / 90 )  =  
= 0,0404 or 4,04 %.  
  52 3) Bond -equivalent yield  
y =  ( PAR – P ) / P x (365 / t )  
where y is the yield, PA R – par value, P - the purchase price of the  security and t is the 
number of days until maturity.  
Example  
 Assume the same 90 day US dollar  Treasury bill issued at 
99% of its par value. It will be redeemed at its par value (100 
%) 90 days after issue. The bond equivalent yield this issue  
is: 
y = (100 − 99) / 99 × 365 / 90 = 4, 097%  
The bond equivalent yield is used to compare Treasury bill yields with the yields to 
maturity of coupon bearing Treasury notes and bonds. The bond equivalent yield is is an 
approximation of the yield to maturity o f a bond.  
The bond equivalent yield is higher than the discount rate. The difference is larger for 
longer maturities and for higher levels of discount rate d. Therefore an error of yield using 
discount rate d increases for longer maturities and for higher  rates.  
 
4) Annual yield to maturity  
y =  ( PAR  / P ) (365 / t ) – 1 
where y is the yield, PA R – par or maturity value, P - the purchase price of the  security 
and t is the number of days until maturity.  
Example  
 Assume the same 90 day US dollar Treasury bil l issued at 
99% of its par value. It will be redeemed at its par value (100 
%) 90 days after issue.  
Annual yield to maturity of this money market instrument is:  
y = ( 100 / 99) (365 / 90) - 1 = 4, 097%  
 
5) Semiannual yield to maturity  
y =  2 x ( PAR  / P ) (365 /2 t ) – 2 
where y is the yield on the basis of  add -on rate, PA R – par or maturity value, P - the 
purchase price of the  security and t is the number of days until maturity.  
Example  
 Assume the same 90 day US dollar Treasury bill issued at 
99% of its  par value. It will be redeemed at its par value (100 
%) 90 days after issue.  
The semiannual yield to maturity of this money market 
instrument is:  
y = 2 x ( 100 / 99) (365 /2x 90) - 2 = 4, 097%  
 Comparison of all the money markets rates and yields are pr ovided in Figure 9.  
It shows that the largest is always the annual yield, which is then followed by semiannual 
yield, bond equivalent yield, the yield on the basis of add -on rate and the yield on discount 
basis. The difference betwee n bond equivalent yield and the semiannual yield are smaller 
for longer maturities and approach as the maturity approaches half a year. The longer the 
maturity, the smaller is the difference between bond equivalent yield and the annual yield.  53 Finally, the longer the maturity, the larger are the differences between the money market 
discount rate and other rates.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9. Money market rates and yields  
Several specific money market interest rates are used in Europe.  
The key European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate is the minimum bid rate, which 
represents the price floor, which ensures central bank liquidity in the open -market 
operations. The two other key interest rates, on the marginal lending facility and the 
deposi t facility, define the corridor within which the overnight interest rate can fluctuate.  
The Governing Council of the ECB sets the level of the minimum bid rate in the 
Eurosystem’s weekly main refinancing operations (MROs). Through the MROs, the ECB 
aims t o supply the liquidity necessary for the banking system to operate smoothly. This 
way very short -term money market interest rates are aligned with the monetary policy of 
the ECB. Through the money -market yield curve, monetary policy is transmitted to 
finan cial instruments and credit conditions more generally, which in turn will influence 
saving and investment decisions and thus will affect price developments in the euro area.  
When money market is affected by crisis in the financial markets, the ECB needs to  
provide additional liquidity in order to support market confidence.  
Apart from the ECB interest rates, there are other main market interest rates for the money 
market:  
 EONIA (euro overnight index average).  The EONIA is the effective overnight 
reference ra te for the euro. It is computed daily as a volume -weighted average of 
unsecured euro overnight lending transactions in the interbank market, as reported 
by a representative panel of large banks.  
 EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate).  The EURIBOR is the ben chmark rate 
of the large unsecured euro money market for maturities longer than overnight (one 
week to one year) that has emerged since 1999. It is based on information provided 
by the same panel of banks.    90 180 Days  Discount rate  Add-on rate  Annual Semiannual 
Bond equivalent yield  Rate  54  EUREPO  (the REPO market reference rate for the eur o) for different maturities. 
The EUREPO is the benchmark rate of the euro REPO market and has been 
released since March 2002. It is the rate at which one prime bank offers funds in 
euros to another prime bank when the funds are secured by a REPO transactio n 
using general collateral.  
 The rate of interest paid on interbank loans in London (UK) is known as London 
InterBank Offer Rate or LIBOR . It is an important reference to banks of the cost 
of raising immediate marginal funds. Numerous bank interest rates ar e therefore 
tied to LIBOR, particularly to the rate for three -month deposits.  
The spreads among the key ECB interest rates and short -term market interest rates are low. 
E.g., EONIA is mostly slightly above, but very close to, the minimum bid rate. The smal l 
spread (about 6 to 7 basis points) reflects that the EONIA is an unsecured interbank rate. It 
includes a small premium for credit risk and transaction costs. Larger spreads normally 
occur at the end of the reserve maintenance period when there is a need for the banks to 
fulfil the reserve requirement.  
The yields of money market securities are closely monitored by money market 
participants. Since money market securities are seen as close substitutes, investors may 
exchange them to achieve more attractive yields. This causes yields among the securities 
to come closer. If there is a difference between yields, investors will avoid lower yielding 
instruments and will favour the ones with high -yield. During the periods of larger 
uncertainty about the economy, i nvestors tend to shift from more risky money market 
securities to Treasury bills and other government securities.  
 
3.4. Summary  
Money market securities short -term instruments, which have maturities shorter than one 
year. Trading with these securities in interba nk, primary and secondary markets are very 
active. The volume of transactions in national markets as well as international markets is 
large. A variety of money market securities allow to meet special needs of borrowers and 
lenders.

 Callable bonds and other bond instruments  
 
4.1. Debt market instr ument characteristics  
Debt markets are used by both firms and governments to raise funds for long -term 
purposes, though most investment by firms is financed by retained profits. Bonds are long -
term borrowing instruments for the issuer.  
Major issuers of bo nds are governments (Treasury bonds in US, gilts in the UK, Bunds in 
Germany) and firms, which issue corporate bonds  
Corporate as well as government bonds vary very considerably in terms of their risk. Some 
corporate bonds are secured against assets of th e company that issued them, whereas other 
bonds are unsecured. Bonds secured on the assets of the issuing company are known as 
debentures. Bonds that are not secured are referred to as loan stock. Banks are major 
issuers of loan stock. The fact that unsecu red bonds do not provide their holders with a 
claim on the assets of the issuing firm in the event of default is normally compensated for 
by means of a higher rate of coupon payment.  
Important characteristics of bonds  involve:  
The conventional or straight  bond has the following characteristics:  
Residual maturity (or redemption date ). As time passes, the residual maturity of 
any bond shortens. Bonds are classified into ‘short -term’ (with lives up to five 
years); ‘medium -term’(from five to fifteen years) ; ‘ long-term’(over fifteen years).  
Bonds pay a fixed rate  of interest, called coupon. It is normally made in two 
installments, at six -monthly intervals, each equal to half the rate specified in the 
bond’s coupon.  
The coupon divided by the par value  of the bo nd (100 Euro) gives the coupon 
rate on the bond.  
The par or redemption value  of bonds is commonly 100 Euro (or other currency). 
This is also the price at which bonds are first issued.  
However, since the preparations for issue take time, market conditions  may change 
in such a way as to make the bonds unattractive at their existing coupon at the time 
they are offered for sale. They will then have to be sold at a discount to 100 Euro, 
in order to make the coupon rate approximate the market rate of interest.  If, vise 
versa, the market interest rates fall, the coupon may make the bond attractive at a 
price above 100 Euro. In these cases the issuers are making a last -minute 
adjustment to the price which they hope will make the bonds acceptable to the 
market.  
Bond prices fluctuate inversely with market interest rates . If market rates rise, 
people prefer to hold the new, higher -yielding issues than existing bonds. Existing  58 bonds will be sold and their price will fall. Eventually, existing bonds with various 
coupo ns will be willingly held, but only when their price has fallen to the point 
where the coupon expressed as a percentage of the current price  approximates the 
new market rate.  
The yield on bonds  are expressed commonly in two forms:  
 redemption yield;  
 inter est yield or running yield . 
Concept  
 Interest yield (or running yield) - the return on a bond 
taking account only of the coupon payments.  
 
Concept  
 Yield to maturity or redemption yield : The return on a 
bond taking account of the coupon cash flows and the  capital 
gain or loss at redemption.  
The types of bonds  include:  
Callable and putable bonds. Callable bonds can be redeemed at the issuer’s discretion 
prior to the specified  maturity  (redemption) date. Putable bonds can be sold back to the 
issuer on speci fied dates,  prior to the redemption date.  
Convertible bonds. These are usually corporate bonds, issued with the option for holders 
to convert into some other asset on specified terms at a future date. Conversion is usually 
into equities in the firm, though  it may sometimes be into floating rate notes.  
Eurobonds . Eurobonds are bonds issued in a country other than that of the currency of 
denomination. Thus bonds issued in US dollars in London are eurobonds, as are yen bonds 
issued in New York. The bonds thems elves may be straights, that is fixed -interest, fixed 
redemption bonds like the sterling ones described above, or they may come in any of the 
variations listed here. Eurobonds are issued by governments but more usually by 
corporations.  
Euro bonds. These a re bonds denominated in euros and issued in the euro currency area. 
If bonds denominated in euros would be issued outside the euro currency area, they would 
be euro eurobonds.  
Floating rate notes (FRNs) . These are corporate bonds where the coupon can be a djusted 
at pre -determined intervals. The adjustment will be made by reference to some benchmark 
rate, specified when the bond is first issued. An FRN might specify, for example, that its 
coupon should be fifty basis points above six -month treasury bill rat e, or six -month 
LIBOR, adjusted every six months. FRNs are, in part, a response to high and variable 
inflation rates.  
Foreign bonds. These are corporate bonds, issued in the country of denomination, by a 
firm based outside that country. Thus, a US firm mig ht issue a sterling bond in London.  
Index -linked bonds. These are corporate bonds where the coupon can be adjusted to high  
and variable rates of inflation. While other bonds have a maturity (redemption) value fixed  
in nominal terms and therefore suffer a decline in real value as a result of inflation,  both 
the value and the coupon of an index -linked bond are uprated each year in line  with lagged 
changes in a specified price index.  
Junk bonds.  Junk bonds are corporate bonds  whose issuers are regarded by bo nd credit 
rating agencies as being of high risk. They will carry  a rate of interest at least 200 basis 
points above that for the corresponding bonds  issued by high -quality borrowers.   59 Strips. Stripping refers to the breaking up of a bond into its component coupon payments  
and its maturity (redemption) value. Thus a ten -year bond, paying semi -annual coupons, 
would  make twenty -one strips. Each strip is then sold as a zero -coupon bond. That is, it  
pays no interest but is sold at a discount to the payment that w ill eventually be  received. In 
this sense, it is like a long -dated bill. The strips are  created from conventional bonds.  
 
4.2. Bond market  
4.2.1.  Bond market characteristics  
Debt markets include:  
primary markets for bonds, i.e. the markets in which newly issued instr uments are 
bought,  
secondary markets , in which existing or second hand instruments are traded.  
Majority of world bond markets have different institutional arrangements for the issue and 
trading of government bonds and corporate bonds. The reason is that governments should 
be able to sell the debt, which they use for budgetary and other purposes. Thus an active 
market with high rated participants should be ensured. Therefore government bond 
markets are subject to high level of supervision and regulation by  the central bank.  
For governments bonds are the main instrument (mainly central governments, but also 
regional and local government authorities, and social securities funds) to finance their 
budget deficits. This is true especially for within the euro are a countries. Besides, 
government bonds often serve as a benchmark for pricing other assets and they are also 
frequently used as collateral in various financial transactions.  
In governments debt securities issues form the most important market segment, foll owed 
by debt securities issued by financial institutions (consisting of monetary financial 
institutions (MFIs) and non -MFI financial institutions), and those issued by non -financial 
corporations. Monetary financial institutions include all financial instit utions whose 
business is (1) to receive deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from entities other 
than MFIs and (2) to grant for their own account credit and/or invest in securities..  
The non -government bond market is dominated by bank debt securi ties. This segment 
includes different types of bonds, including unsecured bank debt securities and covered 
bonds .  
Concept  
 Covered bonds  are claims of the bond holders against the 
issuing MFI that are secured by a pool of cover assets on the 
MFI’s balance  sheet, such as mortgage loans or loans to the 
public sector. . 
The introduction of the euro in 1999 had a major impact on the operations of government -
debt managers as the disappearance of exchange rate risks within the euro area created the 
conditions f or a pan -European capital market. As a result, debt managers became players 
in a larger European market. Investors turned their focus more on credit risk and liquidity, 
while bond portfolios have become increasingly internationally diversified, especially in 
the smaller euro -area countries. Consequently, competition among debt managers has 
increased, stimulating a more efficient primary market and a deeper, more liquid 
secondary market. Governments have put great effort into making their outstanding debt 
and new issues more attractive to international bond investors. In addition to local systems, 
the European electronic platform for government securities, EuroMTS, was introduced in 
1999, enabling quotation and trading of some European benchmark bonds   60  
4.2.2.  Bond m arket  yields  
Bond yields are influenced by interest -rate expectations, the term premium, credit risk and 
liquidity.  
Risk-averse investors demand a risk premium (term premium) for investments in long -
term bonds to compensate them for the risk of losses due  to interest rate hikes; those losses 
increase with bond duration. The term premium leads to a positive term spread, i.e., the 
spread of yields for bonds with longer maturity over yields for bonds with shorter 
maturity, even when markets expect increasing and decreasing interest rates to be equally 
likely.  
Liquidity is one of the key characteristics of the bond market.  
Liquidity  is the ease with which an investor can sell or buy a bond immediately at a price 
close to the mid -quote (i.e., the average of the  bid–ask spread).  
A liquid market  allows market participants to trade at low trading costs. Kyle ( 1985 ) 
identifies three dimensions of liquidity:  
 tightness: the cost of turning around a position during a short period. Tightness in 
essence refers to a low b id–ask spread;  
 depth: a market is deep if only large buy or sell orders can have an impact on 
prices;  
 resiliency: a market is resilient if market prices reflect ‘fundamental’ values and, in 
particular, quickly return to ‘fundamental’ values after shocks.  
The spread between the yield of a bond with liquidity and a similar bond with less liquidity 
is referred to as the liquidity premium  
Credit risk is the risk of loss because of the failure of a counterparty to perform according 
to a contractual arrangement, for instance due to a default by a borrower. The spread 
between the yield of a particular bond and the yield of a bond with similar characteristics 
but without credit risk is the credit -risk premium. Rating agencies – like Moody’s, 
Standard & Poor’s, and F itch – indicate issuers’ credit risk by assigning them a rating.  
.Credit risk  and liquidity premia  of euro -denominated bonds are typically calculated as 
the spread of the bond yields over those of German government bonds. There are two 
reasons for this. Fi rst, German government bonds have consistently received the highest 
ranking from the three main rating agencies, indicating that German government bonds are 
associated with zero or very low credit risk. Second, German government bonds are very 
actively tra ded, ensuring that they are very liquid.  
Yield differentials vary considerably across countries, while for each country the yield 
differential varies considerably over time. Pagano and Von Thadden ( 2008 ) discuss studies 
that try to explain these yield diff erentials, arguing that they may arise from (1) intrinsic 
differences in country -specific default risk or different sensitivities of bonds’ future 
payoffs to common shocks, or (2) market frictions, like trading costs, clearing and 
settlement fees, and taxe s.  
They state that credit risk explains a considerable portion of cross -country yield 
differences but explains very little of their variation over time.  
  61 4.3. Bond valuation  
4.3.1.  Discounted models  
The fair value or fair price of a bond is based on the present value  of expected future cash 
flows. The general formula for estimating the fair price of a bond is:  
P = C/(1+r) +C/(1+r)2 + C/(1+r)3 +. . .+ C/(1 + r)n + B/(1+r)n    
where P is the fair price of the bond (its dirty price, which includes accrued interest), C is  
the regular coupon payment each period, B is the money value to be paid to the 
bondholder at maturity (redemption), r is the rate of discount per period, and n is the 
number of periods to maturity (redemption).  
Example  
 A bond pays a coupon of 4 Euro eve ry six months, and 100 
Euro will be repaid at maturity. There are two years to 
maturity and the next coupon is due in six months. The 
redemption yield  on similar bonds is 6% p.a. Estimate the fair 
price of the bond.  
An interest rate of 6% p.a. indicates a rate of 3% per six -
month period.  
P = 4/(1,03) + 4/(1,03)2 + 4/(1,03)3 +4/(1,03)4 + 100/(1,03)4 
P = 3,88 + 3,77 + 3,.66 + 3,55 + 88.85 = 103,71 Euro  
Typically a single rate, the redemption yield or redemption yield , is applied to discounting 
all future cas h flows. The redemption yield of a bond could be viewed as an average of 
discount rates applicable to the various future cash flows. The redemption yield indicates 
the average annual return to be received by an investor holding a bond to maturity.  
The rate  of discount is the required rate of return from a bond. The required rate of return 
can be regarded as the sum of the yield on bonds that are free of default risk (government 
bonds) and a risk premium to reflect the default risk of the bond being valued. High 
default risk entails a high required rate of return and hence a high discount rate.  
Therefore, for any particular stream of future cash flows, high risk bonds would have 
higher rates of discount and hence lower fair prices than low risk bonds. Thus, bond prices 
have an inverse relationship to interest rates, and second, that they have an inverse 
relationship to the risk of default. High interest rates and high risk are associated with low 
prices.  
An important distinction when considering bond prices is between the clean and dirty 
prices. When a bond is purchased, the buyer must include in the purchase price a sum 
corresponding to the seller’s share of the next coupon. If the coupon is paid six -monthly, 
and the bond is sold three months after the last coupon payment date, the seller would 
require the price to include half the next coupon so that holding the bond for the previous 
three months provides an interest yield. The rights to the coupon accumulated by the seller 
are referred to as accrued interes t. The clean price of a bond excludes accrued interest 
whereas the dirty price includes it.  
Concept  
 Clean price - the price of a bond ignoring any interest which 
may have accrued since the last coupon payment.  
 
Concept  Dirty price - the price of a bond, including any accrued 
interest.   62 Quoted prices are usually clean prices  whereas the price to be paid is the dirty price . 
Example  
 Assume it is 22 November 2010.Treasury 10% 2012 matures 
on 21 November 2012. Calculate the fair price of this bond 
when the re demption yield is 10% p.a. and 5% p.a.  
Assume it is 22 November 2010.Treasury 5% 2012 matures 
on 21 November 2012. Calculate the fair price of this bond 
when the redemption yield is 10% p.a. and 5% p.a.  
Assume it is 22 November 2010. A zero -coupon bond 
matures on 21 November 2012. Calculate the fair price of this 
bond when the redemption yield is 10% p.a. and 5% p.a.  
Treasury 10% pays 10 Euro per year, i.e. 5 Euro every six 
months.  
5/(1,05) + 5/(1.05)2 + 5/(1.05)3+ 105/(1,05)4 = 4,76 + 4,54 + 
4.32 + 86,38 =  100 Euro  
 (Note that 105/(1,.05)4 is the same as 5/(1,05)4 + 100/(1,05)4 
) 
5/(1,025) + 5/(1,025)2 + 5/(1,025)3 + 105/(1,025)4 = 4,88 + 
4,76 + 4,64 + +95,12 = 109,40 Euro  
Treasury 5% pays 5 Euro per year, i.e. 2.50 Euro every six 
months.  
2,5/(1,05) + 2,5/( 1,05)2 + 2,5/(1,05)3 + 102,5/(1,05)4 = 2,38 + 
2,27 + 2,16 + 84,33 = 91,14 Euro  
2,5/(1,025) + 2,5/(1,025)2 + 2,5/(1,025)3 + 102,5/(1,.025)4 = 
2,44 + 2,38 + 2,32 + 92,86 =100 Euro  
A zero coupon bond pays no coupons. The only cash flow 
receipt is the 100 Euro  at redemption.  
100/(1,1)2 = 82,64 or 100/(1,05)4 = 82,27 Euro  
100/(1,05)2 = 90,70 Euro   or 100/(1,025)4 = 90,60 Euro  
Bond prices are inversely related to interest rates, but the relationship is not symmetrical. 
The proportionate fall in the bond price re sulting from a rise in interest rates is less than 
the proportionate rise in the bond price caused by a fall when the percentage point change 
in interest rates is the same in the two cases.  
This can be illustrated by reference to the case of a bond with no  maturity date.  The price 
of such a bond is:  
P = C/r  
where P represents the fair price of the bond, C the coupon, and r is the interest rate 
(required  rate of return). Consider the case of a 5 Euro annual coupon and an initial 
interest rate of 10% p.a. Th e fair price of the bond would be estimated as:  
5 / 0,1 = 50 Euro  
If the interest rate falls by 2 percentage points to 8% p.a., the price of the bond is expected 
to rise to:  
5 / 0,08 = 62.50 Euro   63 If the interest rate rises by 2 percentage points to 12% p .a., the fair price of the bond falls 
to: 
5 / 0,12 = 41,67 Euro  
Whereas the interest rate fall results in a 25% price rise, the equivalent interest rate 
increase causes a 16,67% price decline. This asymmetry of price response is referred to as 
convexity.  
Future cash flows from a bond, together with the required rate of return, can be used to 
estimate the fair price of the bond. The process could be reversed in order to find the 
redemption yield of the bond know ing its current price and the future cash flows . The 
redemption yield (y) can be obtained by solving equation  for y.  
P =C/(1+y)1+C/(1+y)2+C/(1+y)3+C/(1+y)4+B/(1+y)4  
where P is the current market price of the bond, C is the annual coupon, B is the 
redemption  value of the bond, and y is the redemption yield (yield to maturity).  
The effective annual yield  takes account of the compounding. The effective annual yield 
is given by: (1+ y)2-1 . 
Realized compound yield is  the average compound rate of return actually obtained from 
an investment. Realized compoun d yield is affected by yield on reinvested coupons.  
The calculations of redemption yield assume that coupons are reinvested at the redemption 
yield. The realized compound yield equals the redemption yield if coupons are reinvested 
at the redemption yield a nd the bond is held to redemption. If the reinvestment rate for the 
coupons exceeds the redemption yield, the realized compound yield will exceed the 
redemption yield.  
If the reinvestment rate for the coupons is less than the redemption yield, the realise d 
compound yield will be less than the redemption yield. Bond duration and risk  
There are two types of risk encountered by investors in bonds. There is price (or capital) 
risk, and reinvestment (or income) risk . Price risk is the risk that bond prices can 
change. For example a general rise in interest rates, or a fall in the credit rating of a 
particular bond, would reduce the price of a bond. A capital loss would result.  
Reinvestment risk refers to the uncertainty of the interest rate at which coupons and 
redemption sums can be invested. This causes uncertainty as to the final sum that will be 
available at the end of an investment horizon.  
 
4.3.2.  Bond price volatility  
Bond price volatility is measured by duration. The duration measures include Macaulay’s 
durati on, modified duration, and money duration. Macaulay’s duration is the average 
period of time to the receipt of cash flows. Each time period (to the receipt of a cash flow) 
is weighted by the proportionate contribution of that cash flow to the fair price of  the bond. 
Macaulay’s duration is transformed into modified duration by means of dividing it by 
(1+r/n), where r is the redemption yield (which approximates an interest rate) and n is the 
number of coupon payments per year.  
Macaulay’s duration  has another meaning, it is the proportionate change in the bond 
price (fair price of the bond) arising from a unit proportional change in (1 + redemption 
yield).  
Macaulay’s duration = ( ΔP/P) / ( Δ(1+r)/(1+r))   64 Where Δ is the change in, and P is the bond price.)  
The corresponding interpretation of modified duration  is: 
Modified duration = (ΔP/P) / Δ r  
Δ (1+r) = Δ r. 
Equations assume annual coupon payments. When coupons are paid more frequ ently, r is 
replaced by r/n (the annual redemption yield divided by the number of coupon payments 
per year).  
The calculation of duration can be demonstrated by an example. Suppose that a bond has 
just paid a coupon, matures in two years, and pays a coupon  of 6 Euro six -monthly. The 
interest rate is 10% p.a. for all maturities. The fair price of the bond is:  
P = 6/(1,05)+6/(1,05)2+6/(1,05)3+106/(1,05)4 = 5,71 + 5,44 + 5,18 + 87,21 = 103,54  
An interest rate of 10% p .a. is 5% per six -month period.  
Macaulay’s  duration is calculated as the weighted average of the periods to the receipt of 
cash flows. The weighting is based on the contribution of the period’s cash flow to the fair 
price of the bond. The periods are 0,5, 1, 1,5, and 2 years.  
Macaulay’s duration= (5,71/103,54)0,5+(5,44/103,54)1,0+(5,18/103,54)1,5 +(87,21/103,54)2,0 
=0,028 + 0,053 + 0,075 + 1,685 = 1,841 years.  
Conversion of Macaulay’s duration to modified duration is made through division by 
(1+r/n).  
Modified duration =1,841/(1 +0,1/2) =1,841/(1,. 05) =1,753  
Example  
 A corporate bond pays an annual coupon of £10 and has four 
years to maturity. It has just paid a coupon.  As a result of a 
downgrading of its credit rating, its required rate of return 
rises from 8% p.a. to 12% p.a. What are the effects  of this 
change on (a) the price, and (b) the Macaulay’s duration, of 
the bond? (c) Discuss your results.  
 
Example  
 Treasury 10% 2012, which pays coupons six -monthly, will 
reach maturity on 10 June 2012. It is now 11 June 2010. 
Interest rates for 0,5, 1, 1,5, and 2 years are all 7% p.a. 
Estimate the fair price, Macaulay’s duration, and modified 
duration of the bond.  
 
Example  
 An investo r has two bonds. Bond A pays a 5 Euro  annual 
coupon and matures in five years. Bond B pays a 4 Euro  
coupon semi -annually and matures in three years. The 
investor needs to sell one bond immediately and hold the 
other for two years. The current rate of interest, for all 
maturities up to five years, is 6% p.a.  
Which bond would the investor sell if that investor expected 
interes t rates to: (a) increase, (b) decrease?  
  65 4.3.3.  Behavior of Macaulay’s duration  
Macaulay’s duration of a bond behavior can be summarized by a set of rules.  
Rule 1: The duration of a zero coupon bond equals its time to maturity. Since a zero 
coupon bond generates  only one cash flow, the payment of principal at maturity, the 
average time to the receipt of cash flows equals the time to that payment.  
Rule 2: Holding time to maturity and redemption yield constant, duration is inversely 
related to the coupon.  
Rule 3: Holding the coupon rate constant, duration generally increases with time to 
maturity.  
Rule 4: Holding coupon and maturity constant, duration is inversely related to redemption 
yield.  
Rule 5: The duration of an irredeemable bond is given by (1 + r)/r, where r is the 
redemption yield. If a bond pays the same coupon each period forever without the 
principal ever being repaid, the duration equals (1 +  r)/r.  
Example  
 A fund manager holds a 100 -million Euro bond portfolio 
comprising three bonds: A, B, and C. Bo nd A has duration of 
four years and accounts for 25 Euro million of the portfolio. 
Bond B has a duration of seven years and accounts for 25 
Euro million. Bond C, of which 50 Euro  million is held, has 
duration of ten years. What is duration of the portfolio ? 
 
4.3.4.  Immunization  
Bonds are used in institutional investment portfolios not only as means of accumulating 
wealth but also as means of funding annuity payments. Since it is possible to obtain 
reasonably reliable estimates of the duration of prospective annui ty payment streams as 
well as the duration of bond portfolios, it is possible to match the duration of the bond 
portfolio with the duration of the annuity payments. Such duration matching, or 
immunisation, is very useful for annuity and pension providers s ince it provides a high 
degree of protection against interest rate risk.  
Duration is also important for the structuring of bond index tracker funds. If such a fund 
were to be constructed using stratified sampling based on a cell structure, one of the 
chara cteristics of a cell would be duration. Other characteristics might be redemption yield  
and credit rating.  
There would be a cell for each combination of characteristics (e.g. high duration, low 
redemption yield , high credit rating), and the portfolio would  contain an appropriately 
weighted combination of cells. If an annuity fund, index tracker fund, or other bond fund 
exhibits a duration that differs from the optimum it is possible to use bond futures to adjust 
the portfolio duration to the desired value.  
 
4.3.5.  Bond convexity  
Duration provides just an approximation to the relationship between yield changes and 
bond price movements. The analysis of the price/yield relationship for a bond together 
with a straight line representing duration (i.e. price value of a b asis point, PVBP), shows 
that for small changes in yield it is sufficient.  
  66 Concept  
 Convexity  is a measure of the change in duration with 
respect to changes in interest rates.  
However, the actual price change is expressed by the curved price/yield relat ionship. Thus 
for large yield changes, the duration line provides a poor estimate of the actual price 
change. Duration underestimates price rises and overestimates falls. In both cases the new 
bond price is underestimated. The inaccuracies arise because mo ney duration fails to take 
account of the convexity (curvature) of the actual price/yield relationship of a bond.  
While constructing bond portfolios a bond portfolio manager should be concerned with not 
only duration, but also convexity. Convexity has valu e in that it leads to higher bond prices 
following interest rate movements, when compared with an investment with zero 
convexity. High convexity bonds provide this benefit to a greater extent than low 
convexity bonds. The benefits of convexity are greater when interest rate changes are 
relatively large. This implies that the portfolio manager needs to consider the prospective 
size of interest rate movement as well as the direction.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10. Duration and convexity  
If instead of duration a Taylor expansion is used, expressing the percentage change in 
bond price in terms of the first, second and higher derivatives, the approximation is more 
accurate. The second derivative incorporates what has been called convexity:  
Convexity = ( d2P / dy2) x ( 1/P ) x (1 / 2 ) to y2,  
Figure 10 shows, that for increases of interest rates to y 2 the duration plus convexity 
approximation  gives a high estimate of bond price. For decreases in interest rates to y 3 , the 
duration and convexity approximation  give a low estimate of bond price.  
 
Example  
 A bond has just paid a six -monthly coupon of 4 Euro. There 
are four more coupons to be paid by maturity. How accurate

Price   67 of a (a) 0.2% p.a., and (b) 1% p.a., decrease in the redemption 
yield on the bond price, when redemption yields are initially 
2% p.a. Comment on the results of the calculations.  
A bond with high convexity will tend to have a relatively low redemptio n yield . The 
advantage from high convexity would be offset by a lower yield. If interest rate 
movements are small, the gains from convexity would not compensate for the low yield. 
So if a portfolio manager expects a small interest rate change, bonds with l ow convexity 
should be chosen. If the expectation is that there will be a substantial interest rate 
movement, high convexity bonds should be chosen.  
Convexity is greatest for low coupon, long maturity, and low -redemption -yield bonds (i.e. 
high duration bon ds).Convexity can be calculated and combined with measures of duration 
when evaluating the potential effects of interest rate changes on bond prices. Since 
measures of duration are accurate only for very small changes in interest rates, a convexity 
correct ion is required in the case of large interest rate movements. To estimate the effects 
of relatively large interest rate changes on bond prices, it is necessary to combine an 
estimate of convexity with an estimate of duration.  
4.4. Bond analysis  
4.4.1.  Inverse floaters  and floating rate notes  
Financial engineering can create derivatives from a non -derivative investment , e.g.  the 
division of a conventional bond into an inverse floater and a floating rate note.  
Inverse floater  is a bond whose interest rate is inversely r elated to a market rate. For 
example an inverse floater might pay a coupon rate of 10% p.a. minus LIBOR (LIBOR is a 
commonly used benchmark interest rate that reflects market rates).  
The price of an inverse floater is extremely sensitive to interest rate m ovements. Not only 
does the coupon rate fall when interest rates rise, but the rate at which the coupons and 
principal value are discounted also rises. There are two effects of interest rate rises that act 
to reduce the bond price. Conversely interest rate  falls have two positive effects on the 
bond price; the higher coupons are accompanied by a lower discount rate. So inverse 
floaters are very sensitive to interest rate changes, in other words they have very long 
durations.  Inverse floaters are structured by dividing a conventional bond into an inverse 
floater and a floating rate note.  
Floating rate note  is a bond whose coupon rate moves in line with market rates. For 
example the coupon rate on a floating rate note might be 2% p.a. plus EURIB OR. Since 
the coupon rate moves in the same direction as the rate of discount, effects of interest rate 
changes tend to offset each other with the effect that there is little net effect on the bond 
price. Floating rate notes exhibit low price volatility and hence short durations.  
The high duration of inverse floaters renders them useful for hedging long -term liabilities.  
Falling interest rates increase the value of the liabilities, but that would be offset by the 
increase in the value of the inverse floaters. Inverse fl oaters might be attractive to 
institutions with long -term liabilities such as pension funds, annuity providers, and life 
assurance companies. Conversely floating rate notes could be attractive to institutions with 
short -term liabilities, such as banks and building societies.  
 
4.4.2.  Callable bonds  
Some corporate bonds are callable . This means that the issuer has the right to repurchase 
the bonds at a predetermined price (the issuer has a call option on the bonds). To  68 compensate for the risk of future calls, the bo ndholders require a higher coupon (on a 
callable as opposed to noncallable bond), a call premium, and typically a period of call 
protection during which the original coupon is locked in (see Figure 11). 
A rise in the bond price that makes the repurchase desirable would be brought about by a 
fall in market interest rates or an improvement in the credit rating of the bonds. Under 
these circumstances the issuer could repurchase the bonds and issue new bonds at a lower 
coupon rate. The iss uer would choose to repurchase since that would allow for a reduction 
in financing costs. Bonds with a relatively high coupon could be repurchased with money 
raised from the sale of bonds with a lower coupon. The issuer thereby reduces coupon 
payments.  
The predetermined price at which the issuer has the right to repurchase puts an upper limit 
on the value of the bonds. No one would pay a higher price knowing that that they could 
be forced to sell at the predetermined price. The price/yield relationship for  a callable bond 
has an upper limit to the price . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 11. Callable bond  
 
An implication of the u pper limit to the price is that  the convexity turns into concavity. 
Another implication is that the coupon rate on a ca llable bond will be higher than the 
coupon rate on a bond without the call feature. If investors face a ceiling on their 
prospective capital gains, they would require an enhanced coupon yield in compensation. 
Effectively investors are providing the issuer with a call option. The investors would 
require payment for the call option. The payment to the investors takes the form of 
increased coupons.  
Figure 12clarifies the relationship between the values of the call option, the noncallable 
bond and the callable bond. On the horizontal axis the figure shows the value of a 
noncallable bond. As interest rates get lower, the value of the noncallable bond increases.  
The left vertical axis shows the value of a call option for a callable bond with the same 
coupon, par value, and maturity as the noncallable bond. The origin for the left axis is the 
point where the thick black lines cross. As interest rates go down, the market value of a 
noncallable bond increases, and the value of the call option als o increases.

Figure 12. Values of callable bonds, noncallable bonds, and the call option  
 
The right vertical axis shows the price of noncallable and callable bonds with the same 
coupons, maturity, and call price. The origin of the right axis is the right corner of the 
figure. The value of the callable bond is equal to the value of the non callable bond minus 
the call option value. As the interest rates fall, the value of the callable bond approaches 
the call price.  
 
4.4.3.  Converti ble bonds  
Some corporate bonds may be convertible into common stock of the company at the option 
of the bond holder. The bonds are usually callable at par plus a call premium. A 
convertible bond is in the money if the stock value of the bond exceeds the call price. The 
call feature is included to allow the company to force conversion into common stock.  
Conversion can be forced only if the bond is in the money. Call of an out -of-the money 
convertible induces the bondholders to turn in their bonds at the call p rice. Sometimes 
voluntary conversion occurs if the convertible is in -the-money and the dividend yield on 
the stock exceeds the current yield on the convertible.  Call option

Lower interest rates  0  70 Figure 13shows the relationship between the stock value, the straight bon d value and the 
price of the convertible. The stock value is initially below the par value and the stock value 
is assumed to grow over time. The straight bond value gradually approaches  the par value 
as the bond gets closer to maturity. The call price dec lines over time to the par value. As 
the stock value rises above the call price, the premium of the convertible over the bond 
value declines and the market price of the convertible approaches the stock value.  
The market price of the convertible must be hig her than the higher of the straight bond 
value or the stock value. Otherwise arbitrage occurs.  
When convertible bonds are issued, the stock price tends to decline. This evidence is 
consistent with the view, that issuing convertibles is a negative signal t o the market. The 
evidence supports the view that convertibles are issued when the management has negative 
information.

4.5. Summary  
Bonds are debts of the governments, companies, and organizations that i ssue them. One of 
the ways in which bonds differ from shares is in the relative certainty of future cash flows. 
In the absence of default by the issuer, the future cash flows from a bond are typically 
known with certainty. This is in contrast to shares sin ce shares typically have dividend 
payments, which are variable and uncertain. The relative certainty of bond cash flows 
influences the pricing and analysis of bonds. The fair price of a bond is estimated using a 
discount model. The relative certainty of bo nd cash flows means that other characteristics, 
such as duration and convexity, can also be reliably estimated.  Other important bond 
characteristics  are future bond yields and of bond price volatility (risk).  
The debt markets are used by both firms and gov ernments to raise funds for long -term 
purposes, though most investment by firms is financed by retained profits. Firms and Stock value

Equity market  is one of the key sectors of financial markets where long -term financial 
instruments are traded. The purpose of equity instruments issued by corporations is to raise 
funds for the firms. The provider of the funds is granted a residual claim on the company ’s 
income, and becomes one of the owners of the firm.  
For market participants equity securities mean holding wealth as well as a source of new 
finance, and are of great significance for savings and investment process in a market 
economy.  
The purpose of eq uity is the following:  
 A new issue of equity shares is an important source of external corporate financing;  
 Equity shares perform a financing role from internally generated funds (retained 
earnings);  
 Equity shares perform an institutional role as a means o f ownership.  
Within the savings -investment process magnitude of retained earnings exceeds that of the 
news stock issues and constitutes the main source of funds for the firms. Equity 
instruments can be traded publicly and privately.  
External financing thro ugh equity instruments is determined by the following financial 
factors:  
 The degree of availability of internal financing within total financing needs of the 
firm;  
 The cost of available alternative financing sources;  
 Current market price of the firm’s equi ty shares, which determines the return of 
equity investments.  
Internal equity financing of companies is provided through retained earnings. When 
internally generated financing is scarce due to low levels of profitability and retained 
earnings, and also due  to low depreciation, but the need for long -term investments is high, 
companies turn to look for external financing sources. Firms may raise funds by issuing 
equity that grants the investor a residual claim on the company’s income.  
Low interest rates prov ide incentives for use of debt instruments, thus lowering demand 
for new equity issues. High equity issuance costs force companies to look for other sources  74 of financing as well. However, during the period of stock market growth high market 
prices of equit y shares encourage companies to issue new equity, providing with the 
possibility to attract larger magnitude of funds from the market players.  
Check Question  What is the purpose of equity?  
 
Equity markets  are markets which organize trading nationally an d internationally in such 
instruments, as common equity, preferred shares, as well as derivatives on equity 
instruments.  
Concept  Bourse  – a French term often used to refer to stock market.  
 
 
5.1. Equity instruments  
5.1.1.  Common shares  
Common (ordinary) shares  repre sent partial ownership of the company and provide their 
holders claims to future streams of income, paid out of company profits and commonly 
referred to as dividends.  Common shareholders are residual claimants, i.e. they are 
entitled to a share only in th ose profits which remain after bondholders and preference 
shareholders have been paid. If the company is liquidated, shareholders have a claim on 
any remaining assets only after prior claimants have been paid. Therefore common 
shareholders face larger risk s than other stakeholders of the company (e.g. bondholders 
and owners of preferred shares. On the other hand, if the value of the company increases, 
the shareholders are entitled to larger potential benefits, which may well exceed the 
guaranteed interest o f bondholders.  
Concept  
 Common or ordinary share (stock) – an equity share that 
does not have a fixed dividend yield.  
The variability of returns to shareholders  is affected by the proportion of debt to equity 
financing (called the debt to equity ratio) o f the company. The higher the proportion of 
debt financing, the larger the fixed interest payments and the lower is the number of shares 
over which the net profit is to be distributed. When earned profits exceed the level 
necessary to pay the interest, all  the excess profit accrues to the smaller number of 
shareholders. On the other hand, if profits decrease below interest payments, the whole 
reduction in payments is borne by the company shareholders. The higher is the debt to 
equity ratio, the greater is t he variability in dividend payments to shareholders.  Thus 
common shares in ‘highly leveraged’ companies are usually regarded as riskier than those 
in ‘low leveraged’ companies.  
Concept  Leverage:  The amount of debt, relative to equity, in a firm’s 
capital structure . Usually expressed as the ratio of debt to 
equity, D/E, or debt to total capital D/(D E). 
The law requires that the company provides the owners with specified information in the 
annual report and accounts and that the firm must hold an annual general m eeting at which 
management conduct is subject to approval by common (ordinary) shareholders, each of 
whom has a number of votes matching the size of his shareholding.  
The decision to issue equity  against debt is based on several factors:   75  Tax incentives.  In many countries interest payments are tax deductible, however 
dividends are taxed. Thus the tax shield of debt forms incentives to finance 
company by debt.  
 Cost of distress.  Increase of company leverage, increases the risk of financial 
insolvency and may cause distress as well as lead to bankruptcy. Thus companies 
tend to minimise their credit risk and increase the portion of equity in the capital 
structure.  
 Agency conflicts.  When a company is financed by debt, an inherent conflict arises 
between debt hold ers and equity holders. Shareholders have incentives to 
undertake a riskier operating and investment decisions, hoping for higher profits in 
case of optimistic outcomes. Their incentives are mainly based by limited liability 
of their investments. In case o f worst outcome debt holders may suffer more, in 
spite of their priority claims towards company assets.  
 Signalling effect.  The companies, which issue equity to finance operations, 
provide signals to the market, that current share selling price is high and company 
is overvalued.  
Check Question  
 Why does financial distress increase agency conflicts 
between equity holders and debt holders?  
 
5.1.2.  Preferred shares  
Preferred shares  is a financial instrument, which represents an equity interest in a firm 
and which usually does not allow for voting rights of its owners. Typically the investor 
into it is only entitled to receive a fixed contractual amount of dividends and this make this 
instrument similar to debt. However, it is similar to an equity instrument because  the 
payment is only made after payments to the investors in the firm’s debt instruments are 
satisfied. Therefore it is call a hybrid instrument.  
Technically preferred shareholders share ownership of the firm with common shareholders 
and are compensated wh en company generates earnings. Therefore, if the company does 
not earn sufficient net profit, from which to pay the preferred share dividends it may not 
pay dividends without the risk of bankruptcy.  Because preferred stockholders typically are 
entitled to  a fixed contractual amount, preferred stock is referred to as a fixed income 
instrument .  
Concept  
 Preferred share – an equity security, which carries a 
predetermined constant dividend payment.  
Preferred stock investments may have tax advantage  to instit utional investors.  
Majority of preferred shares have cumulative dividend provision , which entitles to 
preferred share dividend payments (current and from previous periods) dividend payments 
on common shares. Usually owners of preferred shares do not partic ipate in the net profit 
of the company in excess to the stated fixed annual dividend.  
Due to the fact that preferred dividends can be omitted, the company risk is less compared 
to risk in case of company debt. However in this case, company may find it dif ficult to 
raise new capital before all preferred dividends are paid. Investors may be unwilling to 
make new investments before the company is able to compensate its existing equity 
investors.   76 Preferred stock is an attractive source of financing for highly leveraged companies. Equity 
markets offer a variety of innovations in preferred shares issues. These varieties include:  
 cumulative preference shares  
 non-cumulative preference shares  
 irredeemable  
 redeemable preference shares  
 convertible preference shares  
 participating preference shares  
 stepped preference shares.  
With the exception of the first two, these characteristics are not excluding each other. For 
example it is possible to issue non -cumulative, redeemable, convertible preferred shares.  
Non-cumulative p referred shares  do not have an obligation to pay any missed past 
dividends, with the effect that missed dividends may be lost forever.  
A redeemable preferred share  has a maturity date on which the original sum invested is 
repaid, whereas most preference s hares have no maturity date (the issuer may pay the 
dividends forever and never repay the principal sum). Some redeemable preference shares 
provide the issuer with the right to redeem at a predetermined price without the obligation 
to do so; in effect such  preference shares provide the issuer with a call option, which 
would be paid for by means of a higher dividend for the investors.  
Convertible preferred shares  give the holder the right to convert preference shares into 
ordinary shares at a predetermined rate; the investor pays nothing to convert apart from 
surrendering the convertible preference shares. In some cases the right to convert arises 
only in the event of a failure to pay dividends.  
Participating preferred shares  allow the issuing company to in crease the dividends if 
profits are particularly high; the preference share dividend can exceed the fixed level if the 
dividend on ordinary shares is greater than a specified amount.  
Stepped preferred shares  pay a dividend that increases in a predetermine d way.  
Specific  adjustable rate preferred shares  are attractive in increasing interest 
environment. If the dividend is reset each quarter according to a pre -established formula 
based on Treasury bill rate, these issues can be considered as company capital .  
Auction rate preferred shares (ARPS)  or Single point adjustable  rate shares (ARPS)  
reset dividend periodically using Dutch auction method. The reset date can be as frequent 
as 49 days. Because of characteristics close to money market securities, they ha ve 
significantly lower yields.  
Concept  Dutch auction  - a method, which allows all investors 
participating in the auction submitting a bid for the stock by 
specified deadline. The bid prices are ranked and minimum 
price for selling of shares is determined. All bids equal or 
above minimum price are accepted, and all bids bellow the 
minimum price are rejected.  
 
Preferred equity redemption cumulative stocks (PERCS)  are shares that pay dividends 
and are automatically converted into common stock at a conversion price and date. These  77 can be callable at any date after the issuance for price above the issue price (e.g. by 40%) 
and gradually declines as the conversion date approaches.  
The cost of preferred equity financing  may be higher, compared to debt financing. 
Preferred dividend is not a tax deductible expense to the company. Besides, investors are 
compensated more, as they assume its risk is higher due to the fact, that the company 
legally is not required to pay preferred dividends. As a rule, preferred equity h as no 
maturity, thus it may force company to permanent preferred dividend payments.

between equity holders and debt holders?  
 
5.1.3.  Private equity  
When companies are organized as part nerships and private limited companies, their shares 
are not traded publicly. The form of equity investments, which is made through private 
placements, is called private equity . 
In such case investors’ liability may not be limited to the amount of contribu ted capital, 
and may be extended to total wealth of private owners. It is used mainly by small and 
medium -sized companies, young or start -up business in need to raise significant funds for 
investment. However, their access to bank or public stock market fi nancing is limited. 
Typically banks do not finance start -ups due to significant risks of their operations, and a 
limited company equity base. On the other hand, a public offering of shares for such 
companies may be feasible only if it has a significant sha reholder base to support an active 
secondary market. Without an active secondary market such shares are illiquid, founders 
of the companies find it difficult to “cash out” by selling their original equity investment, 
can be forced to sell shares at a disco unt to the fundamental company value, fixed costs of 
being public company are high, and this prohibits company from being public. Therefore 
such companies attempt to raise additional capital from wealthy individual or institutional 
investors. This type of investments has grown significantly since late 1990s, mainly in US 
and is slowly gaining ground in European countries.  
The most important sources of private equity investments come from venture capital 
funds , private equity funds and in the form of levera ged buyouts .  
Venture capital funds  receive capital from wealthy individual or institutional investors, 
willing to maintain the investment for a long -term period (5 -10 years). Venture capital 
market brings together private businesses that need equity finan cing and venture capitalists 
(business angels) that can provide funding. Venture capital fund identifies potential of the 
business, negotiates the terms of investment, return from the investments, exit strategy. 
The invested funds are not withdrawn before a set deadline. Common exit strategies are 
either through the public sale of the equity stake in public stock offering, or through cash 
out if the company is acquired by another firm.  
Private equity funds  pool resources of their partners to fund most ofte n new business 
start-ups. They can rely heavily on debt financing, also. Thus, they perform the role of 
financial intermediaries. Private equity funds usually take over the businesses, manage 
them and control the restructuring, charge annual fee for managi ng the fund. Exit 
strategies are similar to the ones used by venture capital funds.  
Leveraged buyouts  are company equity purchases by individual or institutional investors, 
which are financed by a minor portion of share capital and a major portion of debt,  
provided by banks or other financial intermediaries.   78 Check Question  Why does financial distress increase agency conflicts 
between equity holders and debt holders?  
 
5.1.4.  Global shares and American Depository Receipts (ADR)  
Investors may invest into foreign s hares by purchasing shares directly, purchasing 
American Depository Receipts (ADRs), Global Depository Receipts (GDRs). 
Alternatively, investments can be made by investing into international funds or purchasing 
exchange traded funds (ETFs).  
Direct purchase s of foreign shares can be limited due to limited access to the stock 
exchanged, a limited available set of shares, high transaction costs through specialized 
brokerage companies.  
Shares in international funds (International mutual funds (IMFs))  offer pos sibility of 
investing into a portfolio of international securities, created and managed  by various 
financial institutions. Thus individual investors may get access and diversify across 
international stocks. IMFs can be specializing on specific country or a cross several 
countries or regions.  
Exchange traded funds (ETFs)  are passive funds, that track specific index . Thus investor 
can invest into a specific index, representing a country’s (e.g. foreign) stock market.  
Although ETFs are denominated in US dollar s as a rule, the net asset value of an 
international ETF is determined by translating foreign currency value of the foreign 
securities into dollars.  
While the price of each international ETF is denominated in US dollars, the underlying 
securities that mak e up the index are denominated in non -US currencies. Thus the return 
on ETF will be influenced by the movement of the country’s currency against dollar. If the 
country’s currency appreciates, this will increase the value of the index as measured in 
dollars . On the other hand, if the foreign currency depreciates, this will reduce the value of 
the index as measured in dollars. This is also true for IMFs.  
Check Question  
 What are advantages and disadvantages for investing into 
exchange traded funds (ETFs) and  international investment 
funds?  
American Depository Receipts (ADR)  is an arrangement under which foreign shares are 
deposited within a US bank, which in turn issues ADRs in the name of foreign company. 
In this way the shares of a foreign company is admi tted to the well developed stock 
market, like US or UK. When issued in US, they are denominated in US dollars. 
Dividends are also paid in US dollars, even if the underlying security’s cash flows are 
denominated in terms of foreign issuer’s home currency.  
ADR may represent a combination of several foreign shares (e.g. lots of 100 shares). 
Trading takes place in negotiable certificates representing ownership of shares of the 
company.  
Concept  
 American Depository Receipts (ADR)  – a certificate of 
ownership iss ued by a US bank to promote local trading on a 
foreign stock. US bank holds foreign shares and issues ADRs 
against them.  
An ADR program, which is created without company’s involvement, is called an 
unsponsored ADR .  79 If ADR program is created with an assist ance of the company, it is called a sponsored 
ADR . 
Such shares can be registered within the securities exchange commission and comply with 
reporting requirements, and thus be traded on an organized stock exchange. Without such 
registration and reporting co mpliance, they can be traded on the over -the counter market.

Advantages  of ADRs include  
 easy and direct access to funding in the foreign market;   80  building company name recognition in the foreign country;  
 reliable quoting of share prices;  
 close following by investment analysts.  
Disadvantages  of ADRs:  
 A costly investment alternative;  
 For large institutional investors vs small retail investors differences in prices and 
return;  
 Market for ADRs can be illiquid;  
 Multiple listing can result in share price differences in various markets g lobally.  
Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) are negotiable receipts issued by financial institutions 
in developed countries against shares of foreign companies. GDRs can be simultaneously 
issued in US and Europe.  
Financial institution collects and distribu tes dividends paid by the foreign firm to the GDR 
(also ADR) investor. Thus financial institutions facilitate access to world equity markets 
by intermediating between world investors and companies in developing and transition 
countries.

5.2. Primary equity market  
When equity shares are initially issued, they are said to be sold in the primary mark et. 
Equity can be issued either privately (unquoted shares) or publicly via shares that are listed 
on a stock exchange (quoted shares).  
Public market  offering of new issues typically involves the use of an investment bank in a 
process, which is referred t o as the underwriting  of securities . 
Private placement market  includes securities which are sold directly to investors and are 
not registered with the securities exchange commission. There are different regulatory 
requirements for such securities.  
In the private equity market, venture capital is often provided by investors as ‘start -up’ 
money to finance new, high -risk companies in return for obtaining equity in the company.  
In general private placement market is viewed as illiquid. Such a lack of liquidity  means 
that buyers of shares may demand a premium to compensate for this unappealing feature 
of a security.  
 
5.2.1.  Primary public market  
Initial public offering  (IPO)  means issuing public equity, i.e. when a company is engaged 
in offering of shares and is includ ed in a listing on a stock exchange for the first time. It 
allows the company to raise funds from the public.  
If a company is already listed and issues additional shares, it is called seasoned equity 
offering (SEO)  or secondary public offering (SPO) . When a firm issues equity at a stock  81 exchange, it may decide to change existing unquoted shares for quoted ones. In this case 
the proceeds from sale of shares are received by initial investors. However, when a 
company issues newly created shares, the raised fun ds are received by the company.  
Process of going public . The issuing company has to develop a prospectus with detailed 
information about the company operations, investments, financing, financial statements 
and notes, discussion on the risks involved. This  information is provided to potential 
investors for making decision in buying large blocks of shares. The prospectus is 
registered within and approved by the securities exchange commission. Afterwards the 
prospectus is sent to institutional investors, meet ings and road shows are organized in 
order to present the company.  
Concept  
 Road show  – travelling of company managers through 
various cities and making presentations for large institutional 
investors.  
Share issues are often underwritten by banks. A bank , which is underwriting a share issue 
agrees, for a fee, to buy any shares not acquired by investors. This guarantees that the 
issuing company receives the funding that it expects. In the case of rights issues, firms 
sometimes avoid paying a fee to underwr iters by using the deep discount route. In a rights 
issue, failure to sell the new shares would result from the share price (prior to the issue) 
falling below the sale price of the new shares.  
Concept  
 To underwrite – an act of guaranteeing a specific pric e to 
the issuer of the security.  
Lead underwriter  – key investment bank withinn a group of 
investment banking firms that are required to underwrite a 
portion of a corporation’s newly issued shares.  
The deep discount method prices the new shares at such a low level that the market price is 
extremely unlikely to fall so far.  
The share offer price is determined by the lead underwriter, which takes into account the 
prevailing market and industry conditions. During the road show the lead underwriter is 
engaged in bookbuilding , i.e. a process of collecting indications of demanded number of 
shares by investors at various possible offer prices.  
IPO factors.  Public equity markets play a limited role as a source of new funds for listed 
corporations. Because of infor mation asymmetry, companies prefer internal financing (i.e., 
retained earnings) to external financing. Myers and Majluf (1984) have introduced the 
pecking -order theory, which states that companies adopt a hierarchy of financial 
preferences. If external fin ancing is needed, firstly, companies prefer debt funding. Equity 
is issued only as a last resort. Statistics on company sources of financing support this view. 
On the other hand, during equity markets growth and share price increase periods IPO 
market tend  to increase dramatically, while the drop in share prices is followed by 
decrease in net issuance of public equity. A large number of the issues in the late 1990s 
were ‘new economy’ offerings, like the technology, media, and telecommunications 
sector.  
Exercise  
 
 A one for four rights issue assumes offering one new share 
for every four held. A one for four rights issue may be at 160 
Euro when the current share price is 200 Euro. The cost of:  
4 shares each 200 Euro equal to  800 Euro  
1 right each 160 Euro eq uals to  160 Euro  
Thus, 5 shares cost 960 Euro (192 Euro each).   82 It is to be expected that the rights issue would cause the share 
price to fall by  
200 Euro – 192 Euro = 8 Euro.  
Among other factors the economic cycle is considered to play a significant role  in a 
company’s decision to issue public equity. Equity is often used to finance long -term 
investments, which fluctuate over the business cycle. Shiller (2003) has  related the timing 
of equity issuance with investor sentiment. Developments in investor opti mism over time 
may have an impact on the cost of equity, thus influencing the amount of equity issued. 
E.g., excessive increases in risk aversion resulting in falling stock market prices could 
raise the cost of equity, preventing companies from new equity issues. Companies also 
issue equity in order to finance the acquisition of other companies, either by using the cash 
proceeds of public offerings or by issuing shares, which are subsequently exchanged for 
the shares of a target company. Therefore merger an d acquisition (M&A) cycles can also 
be expected to correlate with equity issuance activity.  
There are important  advantages and disadvantages of initial public offerings (IPOs).  
Advantages of IPOs :  
 Possibility to obtain funds to finance investment.  
 The p rice of a company’s shares acts as a measure of the company’s value.  
 Increases of company financial independence (e.g. from banks) due to listing of a 
company’s shares on a stock exchange.  
 Possibility to diversify investments of current company owners by selling stakes in the 
company in a liquid market.  
 Increased recognition of the company name.  
 Improved company transparency.  
 A disciplining mechanism for managers.  
Disadvantages of IPOs :  
 High issuance costs due to underwriters’ commission, legal fees, and other charges.  
 High costs due to disclosure requirements.  
 Risk of wider dispersed ownership.  
 Separation of ownership and control which causes ‘agency problems’.  
 Divergence of managers’ and outside investors’ interests.  
 Information asymmetry problems be tween old and new shareholders.  
 Risk of new shareholders focusing on short -term results.  
 
Exercise  
 Instead of exercising the right to buy at 160 Euro, the investor 
can sell the right. The price could be around 192 Euro – 160 
Euro = 32 Euro, because the bu yer has the right to buy shares 
for 160 Euro when they are prospectively worth 192 Euro.  
A one for one rights issue may be used.  
1 share each 200 Euro equal to  200 Euro   83 1 right each 40 Euro equals to  40 Euro  
Thus, 2 shares cost 240 Euro (120 Euro each)  
Therefore, instead of exercising the right to buy at the 
discounted price an investor could sell the rights. In the one 
for one case, the rights might be sold for  
120 Euro – 40 Euro = 80 Euro  
Note that the one for four rights issue at 160 Euro would raise  
the same amount of money as the one for one rights issue at 
40 Euro (the latter involves selling four times the number of 
shares at a quarter of the price).  
IPO market has received negative publicity due to several problems:  
Spinning.  Spinning occurs, wh en investment bank allocates shares from an IPO to 
corporate executives. Bankers’ expectations are to get future contracts from the same 
company.  
Laddering.  When there is a substantial demand for an IPO, brokers encourage investors to 
place the first day b ids for the shares that are above the offer price. This helps to build the 
price upwards. Some investors are willing to participate to ensure that the brokers will 
reserve some shares of the next hot IPO for them.  
Excessive commissions . These are charged b y some brokers when the demand for an IPO 
is high. Investors are willing to pay the commissions if they can recover the costs from the 
return on the very first day, especially when the offer price of the share is set significantly 
below the market value.  
The literature contains strong evidence that IPOs on average perform poorly over a period 
of a year or more. Thus from a long term perspective many IPOs are overpriced. Since 
introduction of Sarbanes -Oxley Act in US, which aimed at improving company report ing 
processes and transparency, initially returns from IPOs in general have been lower.

5.3. Secondary equity m arket  
Equity instruments are traded among investors in a secondary market , in which no new 
capital is raised and the issuer of the security does not benefit directly from the sale.  
Secondary markets are also classified into organized stock exchanges  and over-the-
counter (OTC) markets .  
Apart from legal structure, numerous historical differences are found in the operations of 
national stock markets. The most important differences are in the trading procedures.  
The trading on secondary markets takes place am ong investors, however most often 
through specialised intermediaries - stock  brokers (dealers) , who buy or sell securities for 
their clients.   84 Securities’ trading in the secondary market form the means by which stocks or bonds 
bought in the primary market c an be converted into cash. The knowledge that assets 
purchased in the primary market can easily and cheaply be resold in the secondary market 
makes investors more prepared to provide borrowers with funds by buying in the primary 
market. Effective secondary  market is an important basis of successful primary market.  
If transaction costs are high in the secondary market the proceeds from the sale of 
securities will be reduced, and the incentive to buy in the primary market would be lower. 
Also high transaction  costs in the secondary market might tend to reduce the volume of 
trading and thereby reduce the ease with which secondary market sales can be executed. 
Therefore high transaction costs in the secondary market could reduce primary market 
asset liquidity. I n consequence there can be adverse effects on the level of activity in the 
primary market and hence on the total level of investment in the economy.  
 
5.3.1.  Organized exchanges  
Stock exchanges  are central trading locations, in which securities of corporations are  
traded. These securities may include not only equity, but also debt instruments as well as 
derivatives.  
Equity instruments can be traded if they are listed by the organized exchange, i.e. included 
in a stock exchange trading list . The list is formed of in struments that satisfy the 
requirements set by the exchange, including minimum earnings requirements, net tangible 
assets, market capitalization, and number and distribution of shares publicly held. Each 
stock exchange specifies the set of requirements.  
Advantages  of listing  on the stock exchange to the corporation and its shareholders are:  
 The ability to sell shares on the stock exchange makes people more willing to 
invest in the company.  
 Investors may accept a lower return on the shares and the company c an raise 
capital more cheaply.  
 Stock exchange provides a market price for the shares, and forms basis for 
valuation of a company.  
 The information aids corporate governance, allows monitoring the management of 
the company.  
 Listing makes takeover bids easier , since the predator company is able to buy 
shares on the stock market.  
 The increased transparency may reduce the cost of capital.  
However there are several disadvantages of listing , which include:  
 Listing on the stock exchange is costly for the company.  
 It requires a substantial amount of documentation to be prepared, e.g. audited and 
prepared according to IFRS financial statements.  
 It increases transparency, which may cause problems in terms of market 
competition and in takeover cases.  
Stock market deale rs and brokers  fulfill specific functions at the equity market. Dealers 
make market in securities, maintain securities inventories and risk their own funds. In  85 contrast to dealers, who risk their own funds, brokers do not own securities, but execute 
matchi ng of buyers and sellers for a specific fee.  
Concept  
 Dealer  – an agent who buys and sells securities as a principal 
on its own account, rather than as a broker for his clients. 
Dealer may function as a broker, or as market maker.  
Dealers stand ready to b uy at the bid price and to sell at the ask price, and making profit 
from the average spread. However, when the stock prices are going down, dealers 
experience loss of value of stock inventory. This forms the primary risk for the dealer.  
Concept  
 Broker  – an agent who executes orders to buy and sell 
securities on behalf of his clients in exchange for a 
commission fee.  
In order to profit from different price movements directions dealers make positioning .  
 If the dealer expects the stock prices to increase, it buys the stock and takes a long 
position . Profit is earned, if the stock is sold at a higher price.  
 If a dealer expects the stock price to decline, he tries to benefit from a short 
position . In a short sale the security is borrowed and sold in the expe ctation of 
buying this security back later at a lower price. The investor tries to sell high and 
buy low, profiting from the difference. Proceeds from a short sale cannot be used 
by the shortseller, and must be deposited at the broker. The shortseller must  pay 
any cash dividends to the lender of the security. This rule is related to the amount 
of drop in stock prices by approximately the after -tax amount of a cash dividend 
after the dividend payment date. Stock exchanges apply downstick restrictions on 
short sales in order to prevent from panic selling and driving stock prices sharply 
down.  
If the dealer’s forecast is wrong, the dealer must close the position at unfavorable price and 
absorb the loss. This creates the risk of dealer bankruptcy, and forces sto ck exchanges as 
well as securities exchange commissions to impose the specific regulations in order to 
prevent this type of price manipulations.  
Concept  
 Short sale  – the sale of the security, which is not owned by 
the seller at the time of trade.  
Securi ty dealers are heavily levered . Typically the dealer’s equity forms a small 
percentage of the market value of his inventory. Most dealers financing is in the form of 
debt (e.g. bank loan). Majority of dealer debt financing is in the form of repurchase 
agreements (REPO, see chapter on Money markets).  
There are several types of stock exchange members : 
 Commission brokers  – who execute buy and sell orders for the public for the fee. 
This is the largest group of market participants, acting as agents of lenders o r 
buyers of financial securities. They may find the best price for someone who 
wishes to buy or sell securities.  
 Odd -lot brokers  – a group of brokers, who execute transactions of fewer than 100 
shares. These brokers break round lots (a multiple of 100 shar es) into odd -lots and 
vise versa for a fee.  
 Registered trader  – who owns a seat on a stock exchange and trades on his own 
account. Large volume of trades, along with the possibility of speedy execution of  86 orders, allow the traders to cover their large inve stments into the seat of a stock 
exchange.  
 Specialists  – who are market makers for individual securities listed on an 
organized stock exchange. Their purpose is to reduce variability of the securities 
prices. When there are too many sell orders, the speci alists have to perfume a role 
of buyers to keep the prices from falling for a period. When there are too many buy 
orders, the specialists have to perfume a role of sellers to prevent the temporary 
rise in prices.  
 Issuing  intermediary  - who undertakes to is sue new securities on behalf of a 
borrower. An issuing house acts as an agent for the borrower in financial markets. 
This task is usually carried out by investment banks  
 Market -maker is an intermediary who holds stock of securities and quotes a price 
at wh ich each of the securities may be bought and sold. Market -making is usually 
performed by the securities  divisions of the major banks  
 Arbitrageur - who buys and sells financial assets in order to make a profit from 
pricing anomalies. Anomalies occur when th e same asset is priced differently in 
two markets at the same time. Since financial markets are well informed and highly 
competitive, usually these anomalies are very small and do not last long. 
Anomalies are usually known, thus there is no risk of arbitra ge, which makes it 
different from speculation.  
 Hedger  - who buys or sells a financial asset to avoid risk of devaluation of 
currency, change of interest rates or prices of the securities in the market.  
Concept  
 Arbitrage  – is the simultaneous purchase of a n undervalued 
asset or portfolio and sale of an overvalued but equivalent 
asset or portfolio, in order to obtain a riskless profit on the 
price differential. It takes advantage of market inefficiencies 
in a risk -free manner.  
Stock exchanges set quite high  commissions  for all member firms. The competition from 
other types of markets, e.g. OTC or third market (direct trading transactions), force stock 
exchanges to move to negotiated commission schedule, where lower fees can be applied to 
larger transactions.  
Majority of transactions at the stock exchanges are fully automated . Small buy and 
sell orders are matched by computers.  
 
5.3.2.  Over -the-counter (OTC) market  
Over -the-counter (OTC) market is the marketplace for trading financial instruments, which 
are generall y unlisted financial instruments. These markets are networks of dealers, who 
make markets in individual securities. Common equity shares that are traded on it can be 
listed and unlisted shares.  
 
Concept  
 Over -the-counter (OTC) market – a market for securi ties 
made up of dealers. It is not an organized exchange, and 
trading usually takes place by electronic means.  
Two large segments of OTC markets  can be distinguished:   87  Unorganized OTC markets  with unregulated trading taking place between 
individuals. Typic ally these markets do not restrict possibilities to buy and sell 
outside of organized exchanges.  
 Highly organized and sophisticated OTC  markets , often specializing in trading 
specific company shares. Examples of organized over -the-counter markets are the 
NASDAQ and upstairs markets in the United States. Trading takes place via a 
computer network. Market makers display the prices at which they are prepared to 
buy and sell, while investors trade with the market makers, usually through 
brokers. The upstairs m arket  is mainly used by institutional investors and handles 
large buy and sell orders (block trades). Institutions place orders through brokers, 
who an attempt to find a transaction counterparty. In the absence of such a 
counterparty, the broker attempts t o execute the order with market makers.  
 
5.3.3.  Electronic stock markets  
Since the middle of 1990s a number of electronic stock markets were created for 
disclosing and executing stock transactions electronically. While publicly displaying buy 
and sell orders of s tock, they are adapted mainly to serve execution of orders institutional 
investors mainly. Registered and regulated electronic stock exchanges developed from 
electronic communication networks (ECN). Some electronic communication networks 
(ECNs) exist along  with official exchanges.  
Concept  
 Electronic communication networks  – order -driven trading 
systems, in which the book of limit orders plays a central 
role. 
The popularity of ECNs stems from the possibility to execute security trade orders 
efficiently. Th ey may allow complete access to orders placed on other organized or 
electronic exchanges, and thus eliminate the practice of providing more favourable quotes 
exclusively to most important clients. As a result quote spreads between the bid and ask 
prices ar e reduced.  
Since ECNs can execute orders of stocks listed and traded on organized or other electronic 
exchanges, they form the increasing competition among the stock exchanges. Examples of 
well known electronic trading systems include Instinet (acquired by  NASDAQ), 
Archipelago (merged into NYSE), SETS (London Stock Exchange’s premier electronic 
trading system).  
As an alternative to organized stock exchanges  the so called alternative trading systems  
(ATS)  have developed, based on the idea there is no necessi ty to use an intermediary in 
order to conduct a transaction between two parties. In fact the services of a broker or a 
dealer are not required to execute a trade. The direct trading of stocks between two 
customers without the use of a broker or an exchange  is called an ATS.  
There are two types of alternative trading systems  (ATS) : 
 crossing networks;  
 dark pools.  
Electronic crossing networks  do not display quotes but match large buy and sell orders of 
a pool of clients (dealers, brokers, institutional invest ors) anonymously. These networks 
are batch processors that aggregate orders for execution. Market orders are crossed once or 
a few times per day at prices, which are determined in the primary market for a security.  88 The trade price is formed as a midpoint b etween bid and ask prices, observed in the 
primary market at a certain time. There is a variety of ECNs, depending upon the type of 
order information that can be entered by the subscriber and the amount of pretrade 
transparency that is available to partici pants. An example of an electronic crossing 
network is POSIT.  
Concept  
 Electronic crossing networks  – order -driven trading 
systems, in which market orders are anonymously matched at 
specified time, determined in the primary market for the 
system.  
Electro nic crossing networks provide low transaction costs and anonymity, which are 
important advantages for large orders of institutional investors. They are specifically 
designed to minimize market impact trading costs.  
However, there is no trading immediacy, since the traders have to wait until the crossing 
session time to execute the orders and an offsetting order entered by other market 
participant. Thus their execution rates tend to be low. Besides, if they draw too much order 
flow away from the main market , they can reduce the quality of the prices on which they 
are basing their trades.  
Dark pools  are private crossing networks, which  perform the traditional role of a stock 
exchange and provide for a neutral gathering place at the same time. Their participa nts 
submit orders to cross trades at prices, which are determined externally. Thus they provide 
anonymous (“dark”) source of liquidity.  
Dark pools are electronic execution systems that do not display quotes but execute 
transactions at externally provided prices. Buyers and sellers must submit a willingness to 
transact at this externally provided price in order to complete a trade.  
The key advantage of dark pools systems is that they are designed to prevent information 
leakage and offer access to undisclos ed liquidity.  
A separate form of computerized trading is program trading , which is defined as 
simultaneous buying and selling of a large portfolio of high rated stocks with a significant 
aggregate value. Another understanding of programme trading refers t o the use of 
computer system (Designated order turnaround (DOT)), which allows traders to send 
orders to many trading posts at the exchange. Program trading is used to reduce the 
susceptibility of stock portfolio to stock market movements, e.g. by selling a number of 
stocks which become overpriced, or by purchasing of stocks which become underpriced.  
The critics of program trading state that it is one of the major reasons for decline or rise in 
the stock market and increases market volatility. Due to these concerns, stock exchanges 
implement collars , which restrict program trading when a wide stock index changes (e.g. 
by 2 percent) from the closing index on the previous trading day. When the collars are 
imposed, program trading for the sell orders becomes al lowed when the last movement in 
the stock price was up (or “uptick”). Conversely, when program trading is for the buy 
orders, it becomes allowed when the last movement in the stock price was down (or 
“downtick”). Such restrictions are supposed to half stab ilizing effect on the market.  
 
5.4. Secondary equity market structure  
Secondary markets are characterized based on the trading procedures.   89 5.4.1.  Cash vs forward markets  
Cash markets are markets where stocks are traded on a cash basis and transactions have 
to be set tled within a specified few days period. Typical period is three days after the 
transaction.  
In order to increase the number of trades most cash markets allow margin trading. 
Margin trading  allows the investor to borrow money or shares from a broker to fi nance the 
transaction.  
Forward markets are markets in which in order to simplify the clearing operations, all 
transactions are settled at a predetermined day, e.g. at the end of a period (month). This is 
a periodic settlement system, in which a price is f ixed at the time of the transaction and 
remains at this value in spite of market price changes by the settlement time. In order to 
guarantee a position, a deposit is required. Such a system does not prevent short -term 
speculation. Some cash markets provide  institutionalized procedures to allow investors to 
trade forward, if they desire.  
 
5.4.2.  Continuous markets and auction markets  
Continuous markets  are markets where transactions take place all day and market makers 
are ensuring market liquidity at moment.  
Deal er market  is the market in which dealers publicly post bid and ask prices 
simultaneously, and these become firm commitments to make transaction at the prices for 
a specific transaction volume. Investors are addressing the dealers offering the best price 
(quote).  
Auction market  is a market in which the supply and demand of securities are matched 
directly and the price is formed as an equilibrium price.  
An open outcry  system allow brokers to negotiate loudly until price, which is an 
equilibrium of buy and se ll orders, is determined.  
In a call auction  market all orders are put into an order book until an auction and are 
executed at a single price. Liquidity requires that such trades take place one or several 
times during a day. Such trading procedures are aim ed at defining the auction price that 
maximizes the trading volume.   
Concept  
 Call auction  – a method of determining the market price of a 
security by finding the price, which balances buyers and 
sellers. Such price fixing  takes place periodically each da y at 
defined time.  
 
5.4.3.  Order -driven markets and quote -driven markets  
The mechanism by which buyers and sellers interact to determine price and quantity of 
securities in the trade is called market structure.   
There are two overall market structures for tradin g financial instruments:  
 order driven and  
 quote driven.   90 Order -driven market structure  allows buyers and seller orders submit their orders 
through their broker. The latter sends these orders to a centralized location, where orders 
are matched and the tra nsaction is executed.  
Concept  
 Order - driven market  – a market without active market 
makers, in which buy and sell orders directly confront each 
other. An auction market . 
There are different forms of order -driven markets. In call markets , the price is de termined 
several times at specified moments. In that way, orders can be collected and the auction 
takes place at the specified time. This type of auction is widely used for initial public 
offerings of equity (and new issues of government debt). The call ma rket mechanism has 
disappeared in secondary markets for bonds and equity, and has been replaced by 
continuous trading systems. In continuous auction markets , public investors send their 
instructions (‘orders’) to buy or sell to brokers.  
Typically order -driven trading systems are computerized. If not all orders at a price can be 
executed, a priority is given to the oldest order. Order driven markets are highly formalised 
as the auction rules for matching trades have to be specified in great detail to ensure  an 
orderly and fair trading process.  
Advances in information technologies have supported the development of order -driven 
markets, in particular for equity trading. The combination of smart trading rules (software) 
with fast computers (hardware) allows an  almost instantaneous matching of orders.  
A group of stock exchanges worldwide (e.g. Paris, Frankfurt stock exchanges) use 
electronic order -driven systems, which allow all limit orders to be stored in the central 
order book. A new arriving order is immedia tely matched with the previously submitted 
orders from the order book. The trader can view all submitted orders and foresee what 
trades will be executed if a new order is entered. The highest limit order and the lowest 
limit order are in fact the bid and a sk prices of the market. One of the examples of trading 
platform of the order -driven system is XETRA, used by Frankfurt stock exchange.  
Quote -driven market structure  is the one , in which market makers or dealers quote the 
prices at which the public market participants are trading. Market makers provide a bid 
quote (to buy) and an ask quote (to sell).  Market makers or dealers earn profit from the 
spread between the two quotes and the turnover of the shares.  
Concept  
 Quote -driven market  – a market in which dealers (market 
makers) adjust their quotes continuously to reflect supply and 
demand. This is a dealer market. Also called price -driven 
market . 
Anyone who wants to trade in a quote -driven market must trade with a dealer. Either the 
investors negotiate wi th the dealers themselves or their brokers negotiate with the dealers.  
Quote -driven markets require little formal organisation, however require mechanisms for 
publishing the dealers’ price quotations and for regulating the conduct of dealers. Stock 
exchang es usually provide the dealers or market makers with privileged access to certain 
administrative procedures or market information. In return for these privileges, dealers 
have particular obligations, i.e. to quote ‘firm’ bid and ask prices at which they gu arantee 
to make trades of up to specified volumes.  
A typical quote -driven system is applied by NASDAQ, in which an automated system 
posts firm stock quotes of the dealers, who place equivalent buy limit orders and sell limit 
orders. However, when posting t he quotes, the dealers do not know, which trades will be 
generated.  
  91 5.4.4.  Hybrid markets  
Hybrid market structures  are the ones, which have elements of, for example, quote -
driven and order -driven market structures.  
A market that integrates traditional floor tra ding with electronic auction trading has been 
developed by NYSE (US). Another example is Euronext, which uses an order -driven 
trading system with a centralised electronic order book. Euronext also enables small and 
medium -sized listed companies to hire a d esignated market maker to act as ‘liquidity 
provider’ in their stock. London Stock Exchange combines electronic order -driven trading 
with liquidity provision by market makers.  
Market structures are often compared from the point of view of their transparen cy and  
liquidity.  In spite of expectations of the same market prices both in quote -driven and 
order -driven markets, in reality quote -driven markets tend to be more fragmented. Dealers 
quote different bid and ask prices, information on executed orders can b e made available 
with some delay (to allow dealers some time to off -load large trades in the market). As a 
result, order -driven markets tend to be more transparent than quote -driven markets.  
Liquidity can be also different. Investors can trade immediately in continuous order -driven 
markets, but have to wait for the next price fixing in a call market. The price, however, 
depends on the availability of sufficient number of orders, i.e. liquidity. Thus investors 
may prefer to negotiate price individually with dealers in quote -driven markets. In quote -
driven markets information about transactions may be delayed also.  
 
5.5. Equity market transactions  
5.5.1.  Bid-ask spread  
When a security is traded, a  dealer, operating as a market -maker, quotes a price at which 
he/she is prep ared to sell – the offer price – and a price at which he/she is willing to buy – 
the bid price. In the transaction t he buyer pays the ask price and the seller receives the bid 
price. The ask price is always above the bid price.  
Concept  
 Ask price  – the pr ice at which market maker is willing to sell 
a security. Also called an offer price . 
 
Concept  
 Bid price  – the price at which market maker is willing to buy 
a security.  
The difference is called the bid –ask spread and is the profit of the dealer :  
Spread  =  ask price – bid price.  
The market bid -ask spread is the excess of the lowest ask price over the highest bid price 
and is normally smaller than the spreads of individual market -makers.  
 
Concept  
 Bid - ask spread  – the difference between the quoted bid and 
ask prices.  
 
Example  Company’s shares are quoted by a broker as bid for 49,8 Euro  92  and 50,0 Euro. The bid - ask spread in percentage is:  
Spread  =  (50,0 Euro – 49,8 Euro)/ 50,0 Euro = 0,2 / 50,0 =  
 = 0,4%  
If investor purchases the share and then immed iately sells it 
before the market price of the share changes, he will incur a 
cost of 0,4% of his investment for the round -trip transaction.  
The bid -ask spread of dealer can be seen as the price to be paid by investors for his 
services. On the other hand , from the perspective of the dealer the spread can be seen as a 
compensation for his costs and risks. The dealer typically holds an inventory of securities 
during the day to be able to sell (and buy) immediately. From his return (i.e., the bid –ask 
spread) , the dealer has to cover the costs of holding his inventory (e.g., interest costs of 
financing the securities inventory) and the risks (e.g., prices may move while the securities 
are in the inventory).  
From the perspective of investors, dealers (in their  role as market -makers) provide two 
important services:  
 possibility to execute a trade immediately from inventory, without having to wait 
for a counterparty to emerge.  
 maintenance of price stability in the absence of corresponding sell or buy orders. 
By trading from their own stockholdings, dealers reduce price fluctuations.  
The dealer costs include the administrative costs of transferring shares.  
The dealer risks arise from price fluctuations and information -based investors.  
For shares that are infrequen tly traded, such as shares in smaller companies, the risks are 
greater, because positions are held for longer periods between trades. If shares are held for 
a long time, the risk of losses from price falls is greater. As a result the bid -offer spreads 
for such shares tend to be relatively high.  
Dealer risk is also related to the possibility of investors possessing information that the 
dealer does not. Such investors are able to make profit at the expense of the dealer. 
Investor can sell shares to the dealer  at a high price, while he is informed about a possible 
fall of share price. As a result the dealer may suffer the loss from a fall in the share price. 
The bid -offer spread is to provide the dealer with compensation for bearing this kind of 
information ris k. 
Dealers have a possibility to negotiate special prices for large transactions. The spread can 
be broader for particularly large transactions (i.e., block trades) to cover the price risk of 
such block trades before the dealer can sell on (or buy) the bou ght (sold) securities to 
(from) other dealers in the market.  
Thus the spread is influenced by the following factors:  
 order costs – costs of processing orders, including clearing costs and costs of 
recording transactions;  
 inventory costs – include the cost s of maintaining an inventory of particular shares;  
 competition – the larger the number of market makers, the greater their 
competition, and the narrower is the spread;  
 volume – the larger the trading volume, the more liquid are the shares, the less risk 
of share price change;   93  risk – the more risky are company operations, the more volatile are its shares, the 
higher spread is set.  
Several research studies showed that bid -ask spreads on specific large stock exchanges are 
wider as they should be. Due to spec ific trading practice, market makers kept their profits 
margins wide. Some analysts called this phenomenon “under -the-table -payment” for order 
flow or the right to execute customers’ trades. Therefore it abuses small investors, who do 
not receive the best price for their quotes.  
Concept  Order flow  – the right to execute customers’ trades.  
 
 
5.5.2.  Placing order  
An investor who wants to buy shares on a stock exchange has a possibility to submit 
different types of orders through a broker.   
Market order  is the simp lest and most common. It requires that the shares should be 
traded at the most favorable price available. The most favorable price is the lowest 
obtainable price for a purchase, and the highest available price for a sale shares. The trade 
then takes place at a price that is currently available in the market.  
Concept  
 Market order  – an order to buy or sell a security 
immediately at the best obtainable price.  
Limit order places a limit on the price at which shares can be bought or sold. Thus it  
specifies pur chase or sale of shares at maximum buying price or minimum selling price, 
respectively.  
The outstanding limit -orders are generally listed in a limit -order book, which allows 
automatic trade matching. However in practice some possibility in setting the pri ority of 
orders remains. Limit orders remain on the limit order book until they are withdrawn by 
the investors, or until they can be executed as a result of new orders arriving.  
Concept  
 Limit order  – an order to buy or sell a security at a specified 
price  or better, i.e. lower for a buy order and higher for a sell 
order.  
Specific types of orders include:  
 Buy limit order (stop buy order) , which specifies that the purchase should take 
place only if the price is at, or below, a specified level.  
 Sell limit o rder (stop loss order) , which specifies a minimum selling price such 
that the trade should not take place unless that price, or more, can be obtained.  
 Market -if-touched order  becomes a market order if the share price reaches a 
particular level. It is diffe rent from a limit order as there is no upper limit to the 
purchase price, or lower limit to the selling price. As soon as trade in the market 
happens at the specified price, the order becomes a market order. However, the 
specified price is not necessarily obtained.  
 Stop order  is also an order that becomes a market order if there is a trade in the 
market at a particular price. However it involves selling of shares after the price 
has fallen to a specified level, or buying after the price has risen to a level . Stop 
orders are aimed at protecting market participants’ profits, or limiting their losses.  94 They seek to ensure that a selling price is not too low, or that a buying price is not 
too high.  
 
Example  
 A broker is intending to by company X shares. He can ac cess 
the central limit order book directly on the internet. The 
following information sell orders (limit prices) and buy 
orders (ask prices) is provided.  
     Sell orders                                                  Buy orders  
Quantity              Lim its                     Limits             Quantity  
1000                         58                          49                    2000  
3000                         54                          48                      500  
1000                         52                          47                    1000  
1000                         51                          46                    2000  
1000                         50                          44                  10000  
A broker has an order to buy 1000 shares  and enter a market 
order to buy those shares. A market order will be executed 
against a best matching order. At what price will he buys the 
shares?  
Another dimension to an order is the length of time for which it remains in force.  
 Fill-or-kill order  is to be cancelled if it cannot be executed immediately.  
 Open order , or good -till-cancelled order , remains in force until it is specifically 
cancelled by the investor.  
 
Example  
 Company X shares is traded at one of European stock 
exchanges and its last transa ction has been at 40 Euro per 
share. An investor entered a limit order to sell the shares at 41 
Euro while the market price was still 40 Euro.  
Company X shares are also traded on NASDAQ as an ADR. 
One ADR represents one fourth of the share (4 ADRs equal 1 
share). ADR price is quoted by a market maker at 10 -10,20. 
Suppose favourable information is disclosed to the market 
participants, which drives company share prices to 45 Euro. 
Who are the parties exposed to losses at the European stock 
exchange and on NAS DAQ if they do not react immediately?  
 
Investors can also specify the period of time for which the order should remain open, e.g. a 
day, a week, or a month.  
 
 
Example  
 Market orders for a company X shares have been entered on a 
crossing network for Europ ean shares. There is one order 
from participant Z to buy 60000 shares, one order from  95 participant Y to sell 30000 shares and one order from 
participant V to sell 40000 shares. Assume that the orders 
were entered in a chronological order and that the networ k 
gives priority to the oldest orders. At the time specified for 
the crossing session, the company X shares are transacted at 
30 Euro on their primary market.  
What trades would take place on a crossing network?  
Assume now that all orders are AON (all or n othing), which 
means that the whole block has to be traded at the same price. 
What trades would take place?  
 
5.5.3.  Margin trading  
Investors can borrow cash to buy securities and use the securities themselves as collateral. 
A transaction in which an investor bor rows to buy shares using the shares themselves as 
collateral is called margin trading  or buying on margin .  
Concept  
 Margin trading  – an arrangement in which an investor 
borrows money or shares from a broker to finance a 
transaction.  
The funds borrowed t o buy the additional stock are provided by the broker, who in his turn 
borrows from a bank. The interest rate that bank charges broker for funds for this purpose 
is called the broker call  rate or call money rate . The broker charges the borrowing 
investor t he call money rate plus a service charge.  
Stock exchange regulations set margin requirement , which does not allow brokers to 
lend more than a specified percentage of the market value of the securities. The aim of 
margin requirement is to discourage excess ive speculation and ensure greater stability in 
the markets. Margin requirement has to ensure that investors can cover their position in 
case the value of their investments into shares reduces. In such a away the possibility of 
default on broker loans shou ld be reduced.  
In order to purchase shares on margin investors have to create an account with a broker, 
which is called a margin account. The initial deposit of cash is called initial margin . 
Concept  
 Margin deposit – the amount of cash or securities that must 
be deposited as guarantee on a futures position. The margin is 
a returnable deposit  
Stock exchange regulations set initial margin requirement , which  is the proportion of the 
total market value of the securities that the investor must pay as an equity  share, and the 
remainder is borrowed from the broker.  
Example  
 Assume an investor buys 200 shares of a stock at 30 Euro per 
share for 6000 Euro of stock on 50% margin and the 
maintenance margin is 30%. By purchasing 6000 Euro of a 
stock on 50% margin, the  investor must put up 3000 Euro of 
cash (or other equity) and so borrows 3000 Euro. The 
investor, however, must maintain 30% margin. Accordingly, 
if the stock price declines 21,43 Euro the stock position has a 
value of 4286 Euro (21,43 Euro × 200 shares). With a loan of 
3000 Euro, the equity in the account is 1286 Euro (4286 Euro 
– 3000 Euro), or 30% of the account value (1286 Euro / 4286  96 Euro = 30%). If the price of the stock decreases below 21,43 
Euro, the investor must deposit more equity to bring the 
equity level up to 30%.  
As time passes, the market value of the shares is changing. The investor’s equity position 
then represents the value of shares, which is left to the investor after the loan from the 
broker is paid back. In order to reduce the possib ility of default, the stock exchange 
regulation rules establish a maintenance margin requirement . This is the minimum 
proportion of the equity in the investor’s margin account to the total market value.  
Concept  
 Maintenance margin – the minimum margin tha t an investor 
must keep on deposit in a margin account at all times.  
 
Example  
 Consider a margin example for a short position. An investor 
shorts (borrows and sells) 200 shares of a stock at 30 Euro for 
a total stock value of 6000 Euro. With an initial ma rgin of 
50%, the investor must deposit 3000 Euro (in addition to 
leaving the 6000 Euro from the sale in the account). This 
leaves the investor with a balance of 9000 Euro (which does 
not change with the stock price since it is in cash).  
However, the invest or owes 200 shares of the stock at the 
current market price. Assuming the maintenance margin is 
30%, if the stock price rises to 34,62 Euro the 200 shares are 
worth 6923 Euro or 30% of the market value of the position 
(2077 Euro / 6923 Euro) and additional  margin must be 
posted.  
The use of borrowed funds for investments into shares can magnify the returns on the 
investment. However, when borrowed funds are used, any losses are also magnified.  
 
Exercise  
 
 Assume investor X has 59500 Euro to invest and is 
considering buying corporation’s shares at a price of 59,5 
Euro per share. With his 59500 Euro investor X can buy 1000 
shares (ignoring commissions). Suppose investor’s X broker 
can arrange for him to borrow an additional 59500 Euro so 
that investor X can b uy an additional 1000 shares. Thus by 
investing 119000 Euro, he can purchase a total of 2000 
shares. The 2000 shares will be used as collateral for the 
59500 Euro borrowed, and investor X will have to pay 
interest on the amount borrowed.  
By borrowing funds , an investor creates financial leverage. 
Investor X, for a 59500 investment, realizes the consequences 
associated with a price change of 2 000 shares of the 
corporation rather than 1 000 shares. He will benefit if the 
price rises but will be worse off if the price falls (compared to 
borrowing no funds).  
If the price of corporation’s shares rises to 68,5 Euro per 
share, ignoring commissions and the cost of borrowing, 
investor X will realize a profit of 9 Euro per share on 2,000 
shares, or 18000. Had investo r X not borrowed 59500 Euro to  97 buy the additional 1000 shares, his profit would be only 9000.  
If the price of corporation’s shares decreases to 52,5 Euro per 
share, then, by borrowing to buy 1000 additional shares, 
investor X will lose 7 Euro per share on  2000 shares instead 
of 7 Euro per share on just 1000 shares.  
The return from the investment into securities is influenced by the proportion of the 
investment that comes from borrowed funds.  
The return on stock purchased on margin is defined:  
r = (SP – INV – L + D ) / INV  
where SP – is the selling price of securities,  INV – is initial investment by investor not 
including borrowed funds,  L – loan payments on borrowed funds including principal and 
interest payments,   D – dividend payments on the security . 
Example  
 Assume investor decides to purchase on margin company 
shares, which have current market price of 60 Euro per share. 
Annual dividend is 3 Euro per share. The investor pays 30 
Euro per share in cash and borrows the remaining amount 
from a broker a t 10% interest p.a. After a year the share is 
sold in the market at 90 Euro per share.  
The return for the investor is equal:  
r = (90 – 30 – 33 + 3 ) / 30 = 100%  
However, if the share price declines to 40 Euro and is sold for 
that price, the return over a year will be equal to:  
r = (40 – 30 – 33 + 3 ) / 30 = - 66,7%  
 
If the investor’s margin account falls below the minimum maintenance margin (which 
would happen if the share’s price fell), the investor is required to transfer additional cash. 
The investor r eceives a margin call  from the broker specifying the additional cash to be 
put into the investor’s margin account. If the investor fails to put up the additional cash, 
the broker has the authority to sell the securities for the investor’s account. Because of 
potential margin calls, a large volume of margin lending exposes the stock market to 
potential crisis. When a sudden huge downturn in the market happens, many margin calls 
are submitted. This may force investors to sell their share holdings, if they do not have 
sufficient cash to transfer in order to reach required maintenance margin. Such sales place 
additional downward pressure on share prices and magnify the negative effect in the 
market.  
 
5.5.4.  Short selling  
In a short selling, investor place an order to s ell a security that is not owned by the investor 
at the time of sale. Investors sell the stock short (or short the stock) when they expect 
decline of the stock price.  
They arrange to have their broker borrow the stock from other investor, and the borrowed 
stock is delivered to implement the sale. To cover their short position, investors must 
subsequently purchase the stock and return it to the party that lent the stock. Thus investor,  98 who owns the stock is unaffected when his shares are borrowed, are not aw are about the 
fact that their shares were borrowed.  
If the stock price declines by the time the short -seller purchases it in the market in order to 
return to the investor, from whom he has borrowed, the short seller earns a profit from the 
difference betwe en the initial selling price and the subsequent purchase price of the stock. 
However, his profit will be less, if he has to pay to the investor, from whom he has 
borrowed the stock, dividends which the investor would have received if he had not 
borrowed th e stock.  
The risk of a short sale is that the stock price may increase over time, which forces the 
short -seller to pay a higher price for the stock than the price at which it was initially sold.  
Stock markets and financial analysts provide information on l evel of short sale. Several 
indicators are used to measure the short position on stock:  
 a degree of short positions.  It is a ratio of the number of shares that are currently 
sold short, divided by the total number of shares outstanding. Statistics shows, t hat 
most often this measure is in the range of 0,5 -2%. A high measure of 3% shows a 
large number of short positions in the market, which may indicate that a large 
number of investors expect the stock price to decline.  
 Short interest ratio for specific shar es. It is the number of shares which are 
currently sold short, divided by the average daily trading volume over the recent 
period. The higher the ratio, the higher the level of short sales. The ratio of 20 or 
more reflects an unusually high level of short sales, indicating that many investors 
believe that the stock price is currently overvalued. For some stock this ratio may 
exceed 100 at particular points in time.  
 Short interest ratio for the market . The higher the ratio, the higher the level of 
short sell ing activity in the market overall.  
Investors, who have established a short position, quite often request a stop -buy order to 
limit their losses.  
 
 
5.5.5.  Stock trading regulations  
Stock market regulations aim at ensuring fair treatment of all investors in the m arket. 
Stock trading is regulated by national securities exchange commissions and by individual 
stock exchanges. It is widely understood, that the development of financial markets and 
success of new issues of securities cannot be handled without efficient and fair secondary 
stock markets.  
Analysis of average real returns on stock in the well developed markets indicate that 
historically it has been about 6% percent higher than return on Treasury bills, which 
reached on average only 1% p.a. The difference bet ween the return on stocks and the risk -
free-rate is a measure of risk premium on equities. However, the size of this risk premium 
is not justified by the stock market’s risk exposure, if only investors are assumed to be 
unreasonably averse to risk. The res earch has shown that only 0,35% of an equity premium 
can be justified as risk premium. Such persistent overpricing of risk premium is called an 
equity premium puzzle . 
 Concept  
 Equity premium puzzle  – the persistent overpricing of risk 
premium on stocks.   99 If the equity premium puzzle is the result of security mispricing, then there is an arbitrage 
opportunity. It means that investor can gain by borrowing at the Treasury bill rate and 
investing in stocks. Borrowing limitations and transaction costs may reduc e this arbitrage 
profit, but not eliminate it.  
The concern about the fair and ethical stock market trading require imposing discipline on 
individuals and institutional investors. The organized stock exchanges introduce 
surveillance of all transactions at the exchanges. Computerized systems are installed to 
detect unusual trading of any particular stock. Any abnormal price or trading volume of 
particular stock or unusual trading practices of market participants is investigated.  
Additional regulations on imp osing good corporate governance practice for listed 
companies are imposed through introduced corporate governance codes. Regulations 
require disclosure of financial statements, having a majority of independent directors (not 
employees of the companies) on their boards of directors. Such requirements are aimed at 
reducing existing or potential conflicts of interest between management and minority as 
well as majority shareholders, focusing management on maximizing stock value for 
company shareholders.  Specifi c regulation concerns are related to restrictions on trading in 
case of market downturns.  
Stock exchanges can impose circuit breakers , which are restrictions on trading when 
stock prices or stock indexes reaches a specified threshold level. The necessity of such 
restriction became vivid during stock market crashes, e.g of NYSE in October 1987 and 
the later ones. When market maker swamp market with sell orders, stock prices cannot 
reflect the fair value any longer and move into a freefall. The market experi ences huge 
liquidity crisis, which feeds panic and exacerbates the price decline. As a result of such 
experience, in order to provide time for market participants to regroup and obtain backup 
sources of liquidity, a series of circuit breakers are put to us e.  
Concept  
 Circuit breakers  – automatic halts or limitations in trading 
that are triggered upon the attainment of certain stipulated 
price moves.  
The NYSE prevailing circuit breakers have three threshold levels for a daily change of 
Dow Jones Industrial  average index from its previous closing level: Level 1 – 10%, Level 
2 – 20%, Level 3 – 30%. If the Level 1 threshold is reached, there is a brief 30 or 60 
minute halt in trading. If the Level 2 threshold is reached, there is a slightly longer 1 to 2 
hour halt in trading. If the Level 3 threshold is reached, the market is closed for a day. 
NASDAQ and other large international exchanges impose similar circuit breakers.  
Concept  
 50 point collar  – provision that prohibits computer assisted 
trading if Dow Jones  Industrial average index rises or falls by 
50 points.  
 
Concept  
 250 point rule  – provision that halts all trading for one hour 
if Dow Jones Industrial average index falls by 250 points in a 
day. 
Trading halts  may be imposed on particular stocks if stock  exchanges believe that market 
participants need more time to receive and absorb material information, which can affect 
stock price. Such trading halts are imposed of stocks that are associated with mergers and 
acquisitions, earning reports, lawsuits and o ther important news. The purpose of them is to 
ensure that market has complete information before trading on the news. A halt may last a 
few minutes, hours or several days. Trading is resumed after it is believed that the market 
has complete information. T his does not prevent investors from a trading loss in response  100 to the news. However, it can prevent from excessive optimism or pessimism about a stock, 
and can reduce stock market volatility. Drawbacks of trading halts are related to slowing 
down the inevi table adjustment of stock prices to the news.  
 
5.6. Equity market characteristics  
5.6.1.  Stock indicators  
Trading of stocks in the secondary market is related to stock price changes.  Investors 
monitor stock price quotations, provided in financial websites and press. Though format is 
different, most of tem provide similar information.  
Stock exchanges provide information on market  capitalization , which  is the market’s 
valuation of the firm and is found by multiplying the number of shares by their market 
price.  
Earnings per share  are net profits attributable to common shar eholders divided by the 
number of common shares outstanding.  
Annual dividend  is a net profit portion distributed to the shareholders over the last year on 
a per share basis.  
Dividend yield  is the annual dividend per share as a percentage of the stock’s actual price.  
The price/earnings ratio (P/E ratio)  is the reciprocal of the earnings yield. It conveys the 
same information but avoids the use of percentages.  
Concept  
 Price / earnings ratio (P/E ratio)  – the ratio of the stock 
market price to the earnings per share. Sometimes called 
earnings multiplier . 
If a firm has a high P/E ratio, the indication is that the market values it highly for some 
reason other than current earnings. The usual presumption is t hat future earnings are likely 
to grow rapidly and the price increased in its anticipation. Shares of another company in 
the same sector might be judged ‘cheap’ if their P/E ratio were low by comparison (for no 
obvious reason).  
Stock quotations also includ e volume  of shares traded the previous day. Stock price 
quotations show the “last” or closing price  on the previous session.  
 
5.6.2.  Stock market indexes  
Stock market indexes are measures of the price performance of stock portfolios, which are 
formed to represent  a stock market as a whole or a specific segment of the market, or sub -
indexes. The well - known indices include the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard 
& Poor’s 500 in the United States; the FTSE 100 in the United Kingdom; the Nikkei 225 
in Japan; t he DAX in Germany; the CAC 40 in France; and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong. 
National stock markets have at least one index, and some countries with well developed 
stock markets (in particular the United States) have numerous indexes.  
Indices can be categorize d by the way:  
 the number of stocks included;  
 the method of weighting the stock prices;  
 the method of averaging.   101 The number of stocks  can vary from a small number of largest most liquid company 
stocks to a wide portfolio of all stocks traded on a particul ar market. The indexes based on 
a small number of stocks have the advantage of easy calculation; however they can hardly 
represent stock market as a whole.  
Weighting of the stock prices is diverse. Contribution of individual stock prices to an 
index may be   
unweighted (as in the case of the Financial Times Ordinary Share Index),   
value weighted (for example the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100) ,  
price weighted (such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average).  
In the case of unweighted indexes all stocks  equal influence irrespective of the sizes of the 
companies. Average of daily rates of share price change is calculated each day and gives 
stock price change average on one day. The product of such changes starting from a base 
date provides the index. The calculation involves two stages: 1) averaging stock price 
changes on a single day; 2) compounding the daily averages over time.  
Example  
 An average of 10% rise of share prices on one day is 
followed by an average 20% rise of share prices the next.  
This gi ves a rise of 32% over the two days: 1.1 x1.2 =1.32 . 
Thus unweighted index is equal to 1,32.  
Indexes have a number of uses:  
 to measure and monitor market movements;  
 To provide a means of ascertaining changes in aggregate wealth over time.  
 To perform a rol e as barometers of the economy; in particular stock market 
movements tend to be leading indicators which means that they provide indications 
of likely future changes in the level of activity in the economy as a whole. Fourth, 
they provide a means of evalua ting the performance of fund managers by providing 
benchmarks against which portfolio managers can be compared.  
 To provide the basis for derivative instruments such as futures and options;  
 To provide the framework for the creation of tracker funds, which is to reflect the 
performance of a stock market.  
 To be used by capital market models, in particular the capital asset pricing model 
(for discount rates for capital projects, estimating required rates of return on shares, 
deriving fair rates of return for utilities).  
Value weighted and arithmetically averaged indexes a key ones. In order to measure stock 
market values, an index has to reflect accurately the total market capitalization. An 
arithmetically averaged value -weighted index accurately measures the aggregate value of 
the stocks covered by its index. A reliable measure of the total value of the market is also 
required for measuring changes in aggregate wealth over time and as a basis for derivative 
instruments.  
 Example  
 Suppose index is based on just  three stocks whose prices and 
numbers of shares issued are the following.  
Stock A      Price 50Euro, total 10 million shares  
Stock B      Price 100Euro, total  10 million shares   102 Stock C      Price 200Euro, total 5 million shares  
The changes relate to just  one day (so no compounding over 
time is involved). Supposed  
(a) that stock A rises in price by 15% during the day while 
the other two prices remain unchanged, and  
(b) that stock C undergoes a 15% price rise while the other 
two prices remain constant dur ing the day.  
Before the price rise, the index equals 100.  
In the event of a 15% rise in the price of A, the new index 
will be (using arithmetic means):  
(New value / Old value) x 100 =  
= (1, 15 + 1 + 1) / (1 +1 +1)  x 100 = 1,05 x 100 =105  
If the price of  C rises by 15%, the new index will be:  
(New value / Old value) x 100 =  
 = (1 + 1 + 1,15) / (1 +1 +1)  x 100 = 1,05 x 100 =105  
It can be seen that a 15% rise in either stock price has the 
same effect on the index despite the fact that C has a higher 
stock  price and is issued by a larger company.  
Arithmetically averaged value -weighted stock indices are the only indices that are 
macroconsistent, i.e. it is possible for all investors to hold the index portfolio 
simultaneously.  An index portfolio is a portfol io of shares that matches a stock index in 
terms of its constituent shares and their relative proportions.  
The large r number of stocks is covered by an index, the more effective it is.  
Indices that provide a very broad coverage, and hence reliably reflect the whole market, 
are referred to as broad capitalization  indices. A good broad capitalization index is 
characterized by completeness  and investability . This should make it possible for fund 
managers to buy all the shares in the index. Investability is par ticularly important for the 
managers of index tracker funds , but may require some sacrifice of completeness in order 
to eliminate illiquid stocks.  
The calculation of value -weighted indices has moved towards a free -float basis and away 
from a total capital ization basis. Free float includes only those shares that are available for 
purchase, rather than all shares. The free float basis excludes shares held by governments, 
founding families, and non -financial companies.  
The stock -index weighting is thus based on the total value of a company’s shares available 
for purchase, and not on the full market capitalization of the company.  
Weighting for multi -country stock indices is subject to discussion. One view is to weight 
each country by its contribution to global market capitalization. However the ratio of stock 
market capitalization to national income (GDP) varies considerably between countries. 
Another view is to use national income (GDP) rather than market capitalization for 
weighting. .This approach would provi de a more stable weighting since relative GDP is 
less volatile than relative market capitalization.  
Exercise  
 Three companies belong to a group and are listed on the stock 
exchange:   103 Company A owns 20% of company B,  
Company B owns 30% of company C,  
Company C owns 10% of company A.  
Each company has a total of market capitalization of 100 
million Euro.  
You wish to adjust for cross -holding to reflect the weights of 
these companies in a market capitalization -weighted index. 
What adjustments would you make to ref lect the free -float?  
Two types of emerging -market stock index are available. There are indices based on total 
market capitalization and indices based on the shares available for foreign investors. The 
performances of the two different types of index can b e significantly different.  
Stock indexes are used by institutional investors as benchmarks for performance 
measurement. Index tracker funds aim to replicate the performance of an index.  
Although most stock indexes are based on arithmetic averages, there are some that use 
geometric averaging. However geometric averaging has particular problems. The 
geometric mean overestimates the effects of rises in the prices of smaller company stocks 
and underestimates the effects of changes in the stock prices of large r companies. Since 
large corporations are large because of rapid growth in the past, it follows that the use of 
geometric means gives too little weight to the stock prices of rapidly growing companies 
and too much weight to the stock prices of slow growth companies. So the use of 
geometric means underweights stocks, whose prices rise rapidly, and overweights stocks, 
whose prices increase slowly. In consequence, over time, indices based on geometric 
means tend to understate the true rate of increase in stock  prices. The cumulative effect of 
such understatement over time can substantially distort the calculated market rise.  
 
5.6.3.  Stock market indicators  
In order to characterize and compare national as well as international stock markets, a 
number of indicators are being used.  
Market size  is characterized by market capitalization. Relative national market 
capitalizations give indications of the importance of each country to international 
investors. Market capitalization weights are used in the global benchmarks. Thus  market 
size forms the basis for global investment strategies.  
Market liquidity.  In liquid markets investors can be more active and design various 
arbitrage strategies. Market illiquidity tends to imply higher transaction costs. Thus those 
investors, who m easure performance relative to a global benchmark, will tend to be more 
passive on such illiquid markets.  
Market illiquidity can be measure by transaction volume  and turnover ratio . Turnover 
ratio is sometimes called share turnover velocity . 
Concept  
 Turno ver ratio or share turnover velocity  – is the ratio 
between the annual transaction volume and the market 
capitalization.  
Price volatility is an important measure in the secondary market, but might also be 
important to the operations of the primary market.  High volatility means that buyers in the 
primary market are subject to a considerable risk of losing money by having to sell at a  104 lower price in the secondary market. This can reduce the motivation to buy in the primary 
market.  
Two factors that affect th e price volatility of securities in the secondary market are the 
depth and breadth of that market.  
The depth of the market  is based on the likely appearance of new orders stimulated by 
any movement in price. If a rise in price brings forth numerous sell o rders, the price rise 
will be small. A decline in price that stimulates many buy orders would be a small decline. 
A deep market would be characterized by the appearance of orders that tend to dampen the 
extent of any movement in price. Greater depth is thu s associated with lower volatility.  
Breadth of that market reflects the number and diversity of the traders in the market. If 
there is large number of market participants with differing motivations and expectations, 
then there is less likely to be substant ial price changes, compared to when there is small 
number of traders, or when the traders have common views such that they buy or sell 
together. A broad market is a large heterogeneous market characterized by relative price 
stability . 
Concentration. Also c alled degree of concentration  can be measured based on market 
capitalization for specific stock exchanges, as well groups of stock exchanges in a region. 
This an important measure for investors interested to know if a national market is formed 
of a large n umber of diverse companies, or concentrated on a few companies. Institutional 
investors are reluctant to invest in small companies, fearing that they offer poor liquidity. 
Besides, it is easier for investors to track performance of a market index (based on  market 
capitalization weights), if it is dominated by a few large issues. A market dominated by a 
few large companies provides less opportunities for risk diversification and active 
portfolio strategies.  
 
5.6.4.  Transaction execution costs  
Transaction costs are an important aspect of implementing an investment strategy. 
However, measurement of trading costs meets difficulties.  
Trading costs consist of two major components:  
 explicit costs and  
 implicit costs.  
Explicit trading costs  are the direct costs of tradin g, such as broker commissions, fees, 
and taxes. The main explicit cost is the commission fee, which is paid to the broker for 
execution of an order. Commission costs are fully negotiable and vary systematically by 
broker type and stock market mechanism. Th e commission fee may be set, dependent upon 
both the price per share and the number of shares in the transaction.  
In addition to commissions, other explicit costs include custodial fees, which are the fees 
charged by an institution that holds securities i n safekeeping for an investor, and transfer 
fees, consisting of the fees associated with transferring an asset from one owner to another.  
Implicit trading costs  represent such indirect costs as the price impact of the trade and the 
opportunity costs of fai ling to execute in a timely manner or at all. Whereas explicit costs 
are associated with identifiable accounting charges, no such reporting of implicit costs 
occurs.  
Implicit trading costs include  
 impact costs,   105  timing costs, and  
 opportunity costs.  
The impact cost of a transaction is related to the change in market price due to supply and 
demand imbalances, caused by the trading transactions. Bid -ask spread estimates fail to 
capture the fact that large trades — those that exceed the number of shares the ma rket-
maker is willing to trade at the quoted bid and ask prices — may move prices in particular 
direction. That is, large trades may increase the price for buy orders and decrease the price 
for sell orders. The resulting market impact, or price change due to the transaction can be 
described as the deviation of the transaction price from the “unperturbed price” that would 
prevail if the trade did not occur.  
The timing cost of a trade is measured as the price change between the time the market 
participants as sume responsibility for the trade, and the time they complete this 
responsibility for the transaction. Timing costs occur when orders are on the trading desk 
of a buy side company (e.g., an investment management company), but are not yet 
released to the br oker, because the trader fears that the trade may swamp the market.  
The opportunity cost of a trade is the “cost” of securities not traded. This cost results from 
missed or only partially completed trades. These costs are the natural consequence of the 
trade order delays. For example, if the price moves too much before the trade can be 
completed, the asset manager will not make the trade. In practice, this cost is measured on 
shares not traded based on the difference between the market price at the time of decision 
and the closing price 30 days later.  
Commission fees and impact costs are actual and visible; however, the opportunity costs 
and timing costs are the costs of forgone opportunities and are invisible. Opportunity costs 
can arise for two reasons. F irstly, some orders are executed with a delay, during which the 
price moves against the investor. Secondly, some orders incur an opportunity cost because 
they are only partially executed or are not executed at all.  
Exercise  
 An asset manager follows an act ive international asset 
allocation strategy . The average execution cost for a buy or a 
sell order is forecasted at 0,5 percent. On average the 
manager turns the portfolio over 1,5 times a year. The annual 
expected return before the transactions costs is 10  percent. 
What is the annual return net of execution costs?  
Several methods of reduction of transaction costs  are applied by institutional investors:  
 Internal crossing , i.e. manager attempts to cross the order with an opposite order 
for another client of the firm;  
 External crossing , i.e. manager sends the order to an electronic crossing network;  
 Principal trade , i.e. the manager trades through the dealer, who guarantees full 
execution at a specified discount or premium to the prevailing price. The dealer 
then acts as principal, because he commits to taking the opposite side of the order 
at the firm price.  
 Agency trade , i.e. when fund manager negotiates a competitive commission fee 
and selects a broker on the basis of his ability to reduce total execution co sts. This 
way the search for the best execution is delegated to the broker.  
 Use of dealer indications of interest (IOI) . Some party may wish to engage in an 
opposite trade for a stock or a basket of stocks. Pooling IOIs from various dealers 
helps to identi fy possible pools of liquidity.   106  Use of futures. There is an opportunity cost associated with the delay of execution 
of large trade. The fund manager could use futures to monitor the position while 
the trade is executed.  
Seeking to control (minimize) the c osts, institutional investors have developed computer -
automated programs to enter trading orders. The use of computer programs for this 
purpose is known as algorithmic trading . Once an asset manager makes a decision to buy 
or sell a large stock position, t he program separates the trade into several smaller orders so 
as to minimize transaction costs. Sometimes algorithmic trading is confused with 
automated trading. The latter uses computer programs to make investment decisions about 
which shares to buy or se ll. Algorithmic trading is used to determine how to place the 
order. However, algorithmic trading does not require that the decision of which shares to 
buy or sell be made by automated trading.  
 
5.7. Stock market efficiency  
Investors do not like risk and they m ust be compensated for taking on risk —the larger the 
risk, the more the compensation. An important question about financial markets, which has 
implication for the different strategies that investors can pursue, is:  
Can investors earn a return on financial  assets beyond that necessary to compensate 
them for the risk?  
Economists refer to this excess compensation in the stock markets as an abnormal  return . 
Whether this can be done in a particular financial market is an empirical question. If a 
strategy is id entified that can generate abnormal returns, the attributes that lead one to 
implement such a strategy is referred to as a market anomaly.  
This problem of how efficiently financial market is pricing the assets traded in  those 
market, is referred to as market efficiency. An informationally  efficient market is defined  
as a financial market where asset prices rapidly reflect all available public information.  
Concept  Efficient market  – a market in which any relevant 
information is immediately impounded in asse t prices.  
This means that all available information is already impounded in an asset’s price, so 
investors should expect to earn a return necessary to compensate them for their 
opportunity cost, anticipated inflation, and risk. That would seem to preclude  abnormal 
returns.  
Check question  
 What are market forces that tend to make financial markets 
informationally efficient?  
As investors attempt to capitalize on new information, which is not already accounted for 
in prices, the stock prices should adjust i mmediately. It is commonly agreed that investors 
over- or under -react to information. This does not mean markets are inefficient unless the 
reaction is biased (consistently over - or under -reacting). In this case investor, who 
recognizes the bias, will be a ble to earn abnormally high risk adjusted returns.  
Check question  
 How should investors behave in a market that is 
informationally efficient? How does this differ from 
behaviour in a market that is not informationally efficient?  
This concept is illustrate d in Figure 14. Before the information becomes public, the 
security has an old value. The new information hits the market. In an efficient market the 
price instantly adjusts to its new equilibrium level. If the market is inefficient, the market  107 may underreact or overreact to new information. If there is underreaction, the price 
adjustment is gradual. If there is overreaction, the market price overshoots the new 
equilibrium value. If market is inefficient, between the time of the news r evelation and the 
adjustment to the new equilibrium value, informed investors would be able to profit at the 
expense of less sophisticated investors.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 14. Market reaction to new information  
 
According to Fama (1 970), there are three levels of efficiency:  
 Weak form efficiency  
 Semi -strong form efficiency  
 Strong form efficiency  
Weak form of market efficiency  suggests, that current asset prices reflect all past prices 
and price movements, i.e. all trade -related infor mation. In other words, all worthwhile 
information about previous prices of the stock has been used to determine today’s price. 
So the investor cannot use the same information to predict tomorrow’s price and still earn 
abnormal profit. Empirical evidence f rom the most of world stock markets suggests that 
these markets are weak -form efficient. In other words, it is not possible to outperform 
(“beat”) the market by using information on past stock prices.  
Concept  
 Random walk theory  – a theory stating that all  current 
information is reflected in current security prices and that 
future price movement are random because they are caused 
by unexpected news.  
The view that price changes cannot be predicted has been called the random walk 
hypothesis. According to it,  price changes are drawn from a probability distribution which 
does not change over time. This constant distribution assumption is a subset of weak form 
of efficiency. Weak form of efficiency can hold, even though the distribution of prices 
shifts over tim e. New information  Underreaction  Perfect 
efficiency  Overreaction  
Old v alue New value  
Time  Price   108 Semi-strong form of market efficiency  suggests that current stock prices reflect all 
publicly available information. The difference between public information and market 
related information is that public information also includes announcements of compa ny 
events, economic and political news and events. Thus, if investors employ investment 
strategies based on the use of publicly available information, they cannot earn abnormal 
profits. It does not mean that prices change instantaneously to reflect new inf ormation, but 
rather that information is accounted for rapidly in stock prices.  
Testing semistrong efficiency raises two serious problems. First, a model of the 
determinants of the stock prices has to be chosen. Second, tests of the model have to 
distingu ish between the anticipated and unanticipated information. Fully anticipated 
information should be already incorporated into security prices. Only unanticipated 
information or surprises have an impact on stock prices.  
Empirical evidence supports the idea t hat the largest world stock markets are for the most 
part semi -strong efficient. This, in turn, implies that careful analysis of companies that 
issue stocks cannot consistently produce abnormal returns.  
Strong form of market efficiency assumes that  asset p rices reflect all public and private 
information. In other words, the market (which includes all investors) knows everything 
about all securities, including information that has not been released to the public. The 
strong form implies that you cannot make abnormal returns from trading on inside 
information, where inside information is information, which is not yet public.  
Corporate insiders (directors, large shareholders) are a group of market participants, who 
are involved in management and have access to  non -public information. Profit from 
insider information through short -term trading gains is illegal. However, they are allowed 
to buy and sell securities of the company they are employed in, for long -term investment 
purposes. Such transactions are called insider trading and have to be disclosed to securities 
exchange commission and to the public.  
Stock market analysis has shown that when insiders are trading company shares, usually 
their results are good. Therefore, insider reports to securities exchange c ommission has 
become an important source of investor’s information.  
In merger and acquisition transactions the price of the acquired firms stock tends to rise 
significantly before public announcement of the transaction. The assumption is made, that 
some i nsiders may be profiting from non -public information.  
Another group of research is related to investment fund earnings analysis. For example, it 
has shown that average fund earns fair rates of return at the certain the risk levels. 
However in some studies the experts forecasted interest rates do not beat the simple 
extrapolation of the current interest rates. The studies showed that the current interest rate 
is a better forecast of the next period interest rate than the experts’ forecasts.  
Besides, investme nt advisory services have not managed to produce return larger than a 
fair return. This evidence is consistent with market efficiency hypothesis.  
On the whole, the strong form of market efficiency is not supported by the empirical 
studies. In fact, event studies state that the opposite is true; gains are available from inside 
information. Thus, various stock markets, as the empirical evidence suggests, are 
essentially semi -strong, but not strong efficient.  
Check question  
 What are the differences among the  three forms of market 
efficiency?  
  109 Check question  
 How can you describe empirical evidence concerning the 
three forms of the efficient market hypothesis?  
The implications for market efficiency for issuers of shares is that if the financial markets 
in wh ich they issue securities are semi -strong efficient, issuers should expect investors to 
pay a price for those shares that reflects their value. This also means that if new 
information about the issuer is revealed to the public (for example, concerning a ne w 
product), the price of the security should change to reflect that new information.  
Concept  
 Volatility – a measure of uncertainty about the future price of 
an asset. Typically measured by the standard deviation of 
returns on the asset.  
 
5.8. Stock valuation  
In order to make investment decisions investors conduct valuation of stocks. They search 
for undervalued stocks for investing and sell holdings of stocks if they are considered 
overvalued.  
There are two approaches to what information is useful in the sele ction of stocks and the 
timing of the purchase of stocks:  
 fundamental analysis and  
 technical analysis.  
 
5.8.1.  Fundamental analysis  
Fundamental analysis  is one of the methods of valuing stocks, which  involves the 
analysis of a company’s operations to assess its  economic prospects. It is based on 
fundamental financial characteristics (e.g. earnings) about the company and its 
corresponding industry that are expected to influence stock values. The analysis is based 
on financial statements of the company in order to  investigate the earnings, cash flow, 
profitability, and financial leverage. The fundamental analysis includes analysis of the 
major product lines, the economic outlook for the products (including existing and 
potential competitors), and the industries in which the company operates.  
This analysis results in projections of earnings growth. Based on the growth prospects of 
earnings, the fair value of the stock using one or more of the equity valuation models is 
determined. The fair value is based on present value calculations.  
Concept  
 Present value  – the current value of a future cash flow. It is 
obtained by discounting future cash flow by the market –
required rate of return.  
There are various models to estimate the fundamental value of company shares. One 
approach is to estimate expected earnings and then multiply by expected price/ earnings 
ratio. Another approach is to estimate the value of the assets of the company.  
Check question  
 Describe the price/earnings multiple approach to investing. 
What determin es the company’s multiple? Are multiples 
stable over time? What does this approach assume about 
market efficiency?   110 The estimated fair value is compared to the market price to determine if the stock is fairly 
priced in the market, cheap (a market price bel ow the estimated fair value), or rich (a 
market price above the estimated fair value).  
Traditional fundamental analysis has several limitations. It does not quantify the risk 
factors associated with a stock and how those risk factors affect its valuation.   
In a perfectly efficient market all securities are always correctly priced. The market price 
equals to the fundamental value of the security. In a market that is partially inefficient, the 
market prices deviate from fundamental value. Financial analysts aim to discover the 
fundamental value ahead of the rest of the market participants before the market prices 
approach the fundamental value in order to make profits. The actions of such profit -
seeking investors push the market towards efficiency.  
 
5.8.2.  Technica l analysis  
The aim of the technical analysis is to identify stocks that are candidates for purchase or 
sale, and the investor can employ technical analysis to define the time of the purchase or 
sale. Such analysis is used not only for investigation of comm on shares, but also in the 
trading of commodities, bonds, and futures contracts. This analysis can be traced back to 
the seventeenth century, where it was applied in Japan to analyze the trend in the price of 
rice. The father of modern technical analysis i s Charles Dow, a founder of the Wall Street 
Journal and its first editor in the period of 1889 -December 1902.  
Technical analysis  ignores company fundamental information, focusing instead on the 
study of internal stock market information  on price and tradi ng volume of individual 
stocks, groups of stocks, and the overall market, resulting from shifting supply and 
demand. Technical analysts believe that stock markets have a dynamic of their own, 
independent of outside economic forces.  
Concept  
 Technical anal ysis – a forecasting method for asset prices 
based solely on information about the past prices.  
Technical analysis  is aimed to determine past market trends and patterns from which 
predictions of future market behavior are derived. It attempts to forecast short -term price 
movements. The methodology of analysis is based on the belief that stock market history 
tends to repeat itself. If a certain pattern of prices and volumes has previously been 
followed by particular price movements, it is suggested that a r epetition of that pattern will 
be followed by similar price movements.  
Question  
 What is technical analysis? Why is there a difference between 
technical analysis and efficient markets?  
The study of past patterns of variables such as prices and trading vol umes allows investors 
to identify times when particular stocks (or sectors, or the overall market) are likely to fall 
or rise in price. The focus tends to be on the timing of purchases and sales.  
H. Levy has suggested that technical analysis is based on t he following assumptions:  
1. The market price of securities (such as shares and bonds) is determined by supply and 
demand.  
2. Supply and demand are determined by numerous rational and irrational factors. These 
include both objective and subjective factors.   111 3. Apart from minor fluctuations the prices of individual securities, and the level of the 
market as a whole, tend to move in trends which persist for significant periods of time.  
4. Trends change in reaction to shifts in supply and demand. These shifts i n supply and 
demand can be detected in the action of the market itself.  
Assumptions 3 and 4 are controversial.  
Supporters of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) take the view that new information is 
very quickly reflected in security prices. If informat ion is very quickly reflected in prices, 
trends do not have an opportunity to emerge. Technical analysts believe that new 
information does not arrive in the market at a single point in time; they take the view that 
new information comes to the market over a period of time. For example new information 
may be available first to insiders, second to professionals, and lastly to the public.  
As the information gradually becomes more widely available, the share price gradually 
moves to its new equilibrium price. T echnical analysts look for the beginning of a 
movement from one equilibrium price to another without attempting to predict the new 
equilibrium price.  
They attempt to profit from forecasting the direction of movement; that is they try to 
identify trends and  profit from them.  
Whatever the reason for a change in price, if the share price responds sufficiently slowly, a 
trend emerges. A slow response of prices to shifts in supply and demand provides the 
potential to profit from technical analysis.  
There are man y technical analysis  and trading techniques, including chart and non -chart 
ones.  
Price charts  are a more frequent technique. Price charts are made for each day, or other 
chosen time interval, with the help of a vertical line. The top of the vertical line i ndicates 
the highest price reached during the day and the bottom shows the lowest price. A short 
horizontal line on each vertical line indicates the closing price on the day.  
A variety of price charts include line charts, Japanese candlestick charts, a po int-and-
figure.  
One aim of the charts is to find areas where price reversals are frequent since this is seen 
as presaging a substantial price movement (break out from a trading range).This would 
appear as a horizontal stretching out of the chart.  
Technical  analysts use a vast number of chart patterns .  
Price channels (Trend channels).  Trend channels can be horizontal, upward or downward 
sloping. The share price remains within the channel, and some points in time breaks out of 
the channel. If it breaks out o f the channel in a downward direction, the chartist may 
interpret this as a signal to sell the stock since it is seen as forecasting a fall in the stock 
price, and vise versa. Price channels are often interpreted in terms of the bounds providing 
limits to the extent of variation of share prices, such that share prices tend to remain within 
the bounds.  
Reversal patterns.  Chartists frequently believe that when the direction of a share price (or 
market index) changes, characteristic chart patterns may develop as the turn occurs. One of 
those reversal patterns is head -and-shoulders  configuration. The highest peak is the head, 
and the lower peaks are the shoulders. When the share price falls below the lower peak, 
further price fall is forecasted and eventually co nstitutes a sell signal.  
Converse reasoning would explain the use of reverse head -and-shoulders, which indicates 
that stock prices will rise and that therefore shares should be bought.   112 Moving averages.  Technical analysts use not only prices relating to ind ividual dates, but 
also moving averages. A moving average is an average of a series of previous prices, for 
example the average of the last 200 daily prices. (Each day the oldest price is removed 
from the calculation of the average and the most recent pric e introduced). Chart patterns 
can be based on moving averages as well as daily prices.  
One popular technique is to use moving averages and daily prices on the same chart. If the 
current price is a predetermined percentage above or below the moving average , a buy or 
sell signal may be indicated. For the market as a whole, the proportion of stocks currently 
above their moving average is seen as an indicator of general market sentiment. Points at 
which a chart of daily prices crosses a chart of moving average s are seen as significant. A 
daily price chart that crosses a moving average chart from below might be seen as 
providing a buy signal. The signal may be dependent upon whether the moving average is 
rising or falling at the time.  
Studies have suggested that  moving average strategies could be successful, e.g. stock 
returns following buy signals from a moving average rule were higher than those 
following sell signals.  
Dow theory . This is  one of the oldest technical tools, aimed to forecast the future direction  
of the overall stock market. Dow theory is based on the belief that market movements are 
analogous to movements of the sea. It sees three simultaneous movements in the market. 
Daily and weekly fluctuations correspond to ripples. Secondary movements (which  last a 
few months) are the waves. Primary trends of a year or more are analogous to tides. It is 
the primary trend that is referred to as either a bull or a bear market. The daily or weekly 
movements are seen as having little or no predictive value. Howev er, secondary 
movements in stock indices are used to forecast changes in the direction of the primary 
trend. A bull market is characterized by both high and low points of successive secondary 
movements moving in an upward trend, especially if this were acc ompanied by rising 
volumes of stocks traded.  Each new peak is above the previous peak, and each new trough 
is above the previous trough.  
Trading volume should increase with moves made in the direction of the primary trend; for 
a rising primary trend, volu me should be heavier for advances than for falls. The market is 
sustained by rising support levels and would break through successively higher resistance 
levels. When the market eventually falls through a support level and then is unable to 
bounce back bey ond a previous resistance level, the beginning of a bear market is signaled.  
A bullish primary trend is seen as being initiated by informed investors, who anticipate a 
recovery. Subsequently uninformed investors start buying, thereby reinforcing the upward  
trend.  
While the uninformed investors continue to buy, the informed investors start to sell. Sales 
by informed investors cause the temporary downturns (the waves).  
Elliot wave theory. The theory sees markets as moving in cycles. There are very long -run 
cycles that last many decades. Superimposed on these are cycles of shorter duration. In 
turn there are cycles of even shorter duration superimposed upon the latter cycles. This 
pattern of cycles within cycles continues down to cycles of very short duration.  
Analysis of the Elliot cycles is based on waves. Each cycle has eight waves. Five waves 
carry the market up and three waves carry it down. At the end of the cycle the market is 
higher than at the beginning.  
The pattern of waves entails a succession of su pport and resistance levels, similarly to 
Dow theory. Elliot wave theory assumes that markets are driven by investor psychology. 
After a fall in prices, investor optimism is seen as growing slowly at first but later the  113 optimism becomes excessive and leads  to a bubble at which prices peak. The bubble bursts 
and the market is then carried lower in the wave pattern.  
Elliot wave theory is sometimes supplemented by the use of Fibonacci numbers . Fibonacci 
numbers seem to fit the pattern of development of a range  of natural phenomena from the 
reproduction of petals on a flower to the formation of galaxies. They are also believed to 
explain stock market developments. Fibonacci numbers are taken from a sequence in 
which each number is found by adding together the pr evious two in the series. The 
sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so forth. Users of the theory employ various 
combinations and ratios of Fibonacci numbers to predict market tops and bottoms, along 
with support and resistance levels. Elliot wav e theory sees cycles as comprising eight 
waves, five on the upswing and three on the downswing, which are Fibonacci numbers.  
Technical analysts also use other indicators , such as filter rules, relative strength, and 
short interest ratios.  
Filter rule  states that an investor should buy when a stock price (or market index) has 
risen by a predetermined percentage above a previous low point. Conversely, the investor 
should sell when the price or index falls by a particular percentage below a previous high. 
The percentages are decided by the investor, but they should be established prior to the 
market movements.  
Relative strength  is measured by the ratio of a stock price to a market index. Changes in 
the ratio are taken to indicate buy or sell opportunities. Fo r a momentum trader a rise in the 
ratio is a signal to buy the stock (and a fall is a signal to sell).A contrarian trader would 
interpret a rise in the ratio as a sell signal (and a fall as a buy signal).  
The short interest ratio  is the ratio of short sale s to total trading. A rise in the ratio has 
two opposite interpretations. First, a rise in the ratio as indicative of bearish sentiment, and 
hence is a sell signal. Second, a rise is a buy signal, since it is believed that the short 
positions will have to be covered by stock purchases. These stock purchases would tend to 
push up stock prices.  
Trin statistic  is the ratio of the average trading volume in stocks with declining prices to 
average volume in stocks rising prices. Ratio above 1 show a bearish mark et, since a 
relatively high volume of trades in declining stocks is indicating net selling pressure. 
Conversely, ratios below 1 are seen as indications of a bullish market.  
Trading volume  is considered an indication of the strength of a trend. If a price m ovement 
is accompanied by a relatively high quantity of trades, it is considered more significant 
than the price movement in a low trading volume market.  
Breadth of the market  shows the extent to which movement in a market index is 
reflected widely in the price movements of individual stocks. The most common measure 
of breadth is the difference between the number of stocks that rise and the number that fall. 
If the difference is large, the market movement is considered to be strong, since it is 
widespread. A market rise is viewed stronger, if prices of large majority of stocks are 
rising. Conversely, market rise is viewed as weaker, when only prices of stocks of a few 
large capitalization companies are increasing.  
Mutual fund cash holdings, if they increase,  might an indication  of a market rise based 
on belief that the cash will be used to buy shares. This demand for shares would tend to 
push prices up. Conversely, low mutual fund cash holdings are seen as a bearish signal.  
Put-call ratio.  Put options give t he right to sell shares at a specified price, and are bought 
by investors who expect share prices to fall. Call options give the right to buy shares at a 
specified price, and are bought by investors who expect share prices to rise. The ratio of 
puts bought  to calls bought is used as an indicator of the expectations of investors.  114 However technical analysts have different interpretations of the ratio. Some see a high put -
call ratio as a sign of a bearish market based on the belief that it indicates that inves tors in 
general expect stock price falls. Others have a contrarian view, and see a high put -call ratio 
as a buy signal. Contrarian analysts base their analysis on the belief that investors are 
usually wrong.  
Technical analysis is often, though regarded as an essential tool of investment analysis by 
market practitioners, however is criticized by academics. The criticism from academics 
tends to focus on the absence of a coherent body of theory to explain technical analysis, 
and on the difficulty of using stat istical tests to ascertain its effectiveness.  
The past theories proposed by technical analysts tended to be ad hoc and inconsistent. 
There has been no coherent rationale as to why technical analysis should work. However, 
the recent development of behaviora l finance is contributing to the emergence of 
theoretical justifications of technical analysis.  
If social and psychological forces influence stock market behavior in consistent ways, 
technical analysis could be seen as a technique for identifying those fo rces and forecasting 
their effects. Besides, behavioral finance can also be applied to explain the behavior of 
technical analysts. Technical analysts may be influenced by the same social and 
psychological biases as other market participants. Those biases w ould tend to influence 
technical analysts’ interpretations of their charts and other data. The forecasts of technical 
analysts could be affected by the same biases, which the analysts may be seeking to 
identify among other market participants.  
Institutiona l investors tend to use technical analysis alongside other methods of investment 
analysis. The research evidence on the ability of institutional investors to outperform stock 
market indices indicates that, at best, such outperformance is marginal.  This ev idence 
throws doubt on the effectiveness of investment analysis, including technical analysis. 
However since the stock market in aggregate is equal to the sum of investment portfolios, 
such findings might be expected. Investment analysis may be a zero -sum game in that 
those making profits make them at the expense of other analysts.  
 
5.9. Processes of consolidation of stock exchanges  
The importance of equity finance in the world markets is growing, although there are large 
differences across stock exchanges. The market capitalisation of the largest world markets 
(e.g. NYSE, NASDAQOMX, Euronext, London Stock Exchange (LSE)) are much higher 
than those of other stock exchanges. Stock market is highly concentrated.  For example, 
measured by trading activity, the market  share of the five largest stock exchanges in 
Europe exceeded 90 per cent in 2009, with the LSE having the largest share of total EU 
turnover. The stock -market concentration level is almost identical in terms of market 
capitalisation. This high level of co ncentration may be explained by the fact that financial 
exchanges exhibit network externalities, as higher participation of traders on both sides of 
the market positively affects market liquidity and increases traders’ utility. For some of the 
key stock ma rkets it appears that even if market capitalisation is similar in value (e.g. LSE 
and Euronext), there are significant differences in the turnover. This suggests that when 
shares are more actively traded, the stock market provides for a deeper and more liq uid 
market.  
Despite the increase in equity finance, public equity markets play a limited role as a source 
of new funds for firms that raise external financing generally via bank loans or debt 
securities. Still, the number and value of initial public offeri ngs (IPOs) grew spectacularly 
from the mid -1990s.   115 The recent development of the stock exchanges has shown an intensive regional cross -
border consolidation, which is especially vivid among EU stock markets. Euronext 
resulted from a merger of the Paris, Amst erdam, Brussels, and Lisbon stock exchanges 
during 2000 –2002. Stock exchanges of Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, Tallin, Riga, 
Vilnius, and Iceland merged between 2004 and 2006, creating the OMX Nordic Exchange. 
It was followed by a merger of NASDAQ and O MX Nordic Exchange to form 
NASDAQOMX.  In June 2007 Italy’s stock -exchange operator Borsa Italiana accepted a 
takeover from the LSE. In 2006, a trans -Atlantic stock exchange merger took place 
between Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), strengt hening its position 
as the largest securities trading venue in the world.  
In 2007, two other trans -Atlantic deals were announced: an acquisition of the  International 
Securities Exchange (New York) by Deutsche Börse and a merger between NASDAQ and 
OMX to fo rm NASDAQOMX.  
Processes of consolidation are fostered by multiple share listings of the companies. 
Multiple share listing happens when company shares are listed on more than one stock 
exchange. They can also be simultaneously traded on formal stock exchang es and OTC 
markets. Stocks of very large multinational companies list their shares on several national 
stock exchanges. Trading in such stocks can effectively be global and may operate on a 
24-hour basis (as one exchange closes, trading may continue on oth ers). 
Further globalization of financial markets is related to the tendency for financial markets 
in different countries to become integrated into a single market. A major factor leading to 
globalization has been the development of telecommunications. Othe r factors have been 
the tendencies towards international diversification of portfolios, and deregulation of 
national financial markets.  
Consolidation is viewed to have several advantages. Larger exchanges enjoy economies of 
scale that reduce trading costs,  which in turn attracts more traders and listed companies. 
After the merger market capitalisation of the merged stock exchanges has grown faster  
than that of its smaller competitors.  
While consolidation allows an exchange to exploit economies of scale, it may also reduce 
competition and thus lower an exchange’s incentive for financial innovation (in the form 
of developing new, cheaper, trading mechanisms). The impact of competition is interesting 
in equity trading. Competition may reduce trading fees, but f ragmentation of the order 
flow between exchanges may reduce the liquidity of equity trading. However, some of the 
stock market studies have found evidence of reduced fees and improved liquidity. 
Liquidity is improved as some brokers automate the routing de cision between the two 
exchanges to obtain the best execution price. In that way, the order flow at the two 
exchanges is indirectly combined.  
There are still some challenges for further consolidation in stock markets. First, the 
clearing and settlement inf rastructure in Europe has remained fragmented so far. Studies 
suggest that post -trading costs per transaction in the EU are substantially higher than in the 
US. Next, cross -border exchanges like Euronext and NASDAQ OMX force national 
financial supervisors to co -operate.  
 
5.10. Summary  
Equity markets exist to facilitate the transfer of funds from savers of funds to investors, 
which need to raise money. Organized stock exchanges as well as over the counter markets 
ensure that a secondary market provides a means fo r existing investors to sell their equity 
securities.   116 Newly issued shares are sold in the primary market by public offer, tender, placement, or 
through a rights issue. In addition to common (ordinary) shares there are various types of 
preferred shares.  
Stock exchanges may be order -driven, quote -driven, or a hybrid of these two systems. In 
all stock market trading systems share prices are determined by the demand and supply. 
The key types of orders are market orders, which accept the existing share price, an d limit 
orders which specify upper limits to buying prices or lower limits to selling prices.  
Most individual investors buy equity instruments indirectly through institutional investors 
such as pension funds, insurance companies, and investment funds. The refore most of the 
trading on stock exchanges is done through institutional investors. Some types of 
institutional investment, like investment funds or exchange -traded funds (ETFs), trade 
their own shares on a stock exchange directly.  
Stock markets operat e most efficiently if they have sufficient depth and breadth. A deep 
market has a large number of traders, who ensure that small price movements raise many 
new buy or sell orders. This helps to avoid excessive share price volatility, since price falls 
are met by new purchase orders, and price rises are met by new sell orders. A broad 
market contains traders with differing opinions such that some will be forecasting price 
rises whilst others expect falls.  
The diversity of views helps to prevent large price swings. When stock markets are 
characterized by uniformity of opinion, extreme share price movements can result. If the 
overwhelming majority of investors expect a rise, there would be many buyers and few 
sellers. Sharp price rises (a bubble) would result.  If the majority expects a price fall, sales 
would dominate purchases and share prices could fall dramatically (and a stock market 
crash can occur).

 Definition of derivatives markets  
 Financial futures and hedging against risk  
 Options and their use  
 
6.1. Hedging against risk   
Investments based on some underlying assets are known as derivatives. The capital 
invested is less than the p rice of the underlying asset. This creates financial leverage and 
allows investors to multiply the rate of return on the underlying asset. Because of this 
leverage, derivatives have several uses,  
 Speculative or taking an advantage over specific profit oppo rtunity,  
 Hedging a portfolio against a specific risk.  
Participants in derivative markets own portfolios of financial securities, which must be 
taken into consideration when understanding impact of any particular derivatives 
transaction.  
Any derivatives t ransaction involves cash flows, which are more or less opposite to the 
cash flows generated by the other securities in the portfolio. When the two sets of cash 
flows moves in the opposite direction, it is a hedge . When the two sets of cash flows 
moves in t he same direction, it is a speculative position . This is why speculative trades 
increase risk exposure, while hedging reduces risk exposure.  
Hedging ensures counterbalancing cash flows, which reduce dispersion of possible 
outcomes and therefore reduces the  risk. Conversely, by adding more cash flows, which 
move in the same direction, speculating increases profit when outcomes are favourable, 
but increases losses when outcomes are unfavourable. Thus the risk is increased.  
The underlying cash position is the twin transaction that is undertaken simultaneously with 
the derivatives trade. The underlying cash position motivates the hedge transaction. If the 
underlying cash position consists of only one financial security, then it is called 
microhedge. If the under lying cash position consists of a portfolio of financial securities, 
then it is called macrohedge.  
Macrohedging is prevalent in financial institutions than in non -financial companies, which 
may be hedging only a single financial security on their balance sheets. The hedge is 
always tailored to the hedger’s underlying cash position. The hedger’s cash flows as well 
as his goals will determine the configuration of the derivatives transaction.  
 
6.2. Description of derivatives markets  
The establishment and growth of  financial derivatives markets has been major 
development trend in financial markets over the past thirty -five years. Financial innovation 
and increased market demand led to a rapid growth of derivatives trading. Development of 
financial derivatives was sp eeded up by the globalization of business, the increased 
volatility of foreign exchange rates, and increasing and fluctuating rates of inflation.   121  
Concept  
 Derivatives - securities .bearing a contractual relation to 
some underlying asset or rate.  
In gene ral derivatives  contracts promise to deliver underlying products at some time in the 
future or give  the right to buy or sell them in the future.  They can be based on different 
types of assets (such as equities or commodities), prices (such as interest rat es or exchange 
rates), or indexes (such as a stock -market index).  
The derivative contract can then be traded in a different market from that in which the 
underlying product (equity, bonds, currency) is itself traded. Markets in which underlying 
products ar e traded (such as the forex market) are often referred to as cash markets to 
distinguish them from derivatives  markets.  Although cash and derivatives markets are 
separate, the derivatives markets are linked to cash markets through the possibility that a 
delivery of the underlying product might be required.  
There is a close relationship between the prices of derivatives contracts and the prices of 
the underlying assets they represent, and that the value of a derivative, and hence its price, 
varies as the pr ice in the cash market fluctuates. However, in practice, derivatives seldom 
lead to the exchange of the underlying product. Instead, contracts are closed out or allowed 
to lapse before the delivery date arrives.  
For portfolio managers change of the risk pr ofile through derivative transactions takes a 
very low cost. Without derivatives, portfolio managers have to conduct transactions in the 
underlying cash markets (i.e., money, bond, or equity markets) at a higher cost, including 
the costly transfer of secur ities. Thus the dynamic growth of hedge funds can be explained 
by the rise of low -cost derivatives markets. Hedge funds typically exploit small price 
differences of similar financial products. Only when the transaction cost is smaller than the 
price differ ential, then hedge fund takes a position.  
The types of derivatives  include:  
 Options,  
 Forwards,  
 Futures,  
 Swap contracts  
 Various forms of bonds.  
 A forward contract gives the holder the obligation to buy or sell a certain underlying 
instrument (like a bond)  at a certain date in the future (i.e., the delivery or final settlement 
date), at a specified price (i.e., the settlement price). Forward contracts consist of futures 
and swaps. Futures contracts are forward contracts traded on organised exchanges. Swaps 
are forward contracts in which counterparties agree to exchange streams of cash flows 
according to predetermined rules. For example, an interest -rate swap is a derivative in 
which one party exchanges a stream of interest payments for another party’s stream  of 
cash flows. The most important difference with options is that options give the holder the 
right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a certain underlying instrument at a certain date 
in the future at a specified price.  
Derivatives are traded on org anised exchanges or over -the-counter (OTC) market. 
Derivatives contracts traded and privately negotiated directly between two parties belong 
to the OTC market, generally interest -rate linked derivatives, like swaps and forward -rate 
agreements. All contract  terms, such as delivery quality, quantity, location, date, and price,  122 are negotiable in it. The total value of derivative contracts  outstanding in global OTC 
markets is substantially higher than the exchanges -traded amount. A trend is a provision of 
stand ard contracts, which makes it easier for more participants to access the OTC markets. 
Besides, OTC trades are increasingly being cleared through clearinghouses in much the 
same way as exchange -based contracts.  
Derivative contracts like futures and options , which are traded in organised exchanges are 
generally standardised, based on electronic trading. The traditional distinction between 
exchange -based and OTC derivatives is becoming less clear.  
 
6.3. Forward and futures contracts  
6.3.1.  Principles of forward and futu res contracts  
A futures contract  is a legally binding commitment to buy or sell a standard quantity of a 
something at a price determined in the present (the futures price) on a specified future date.  
The buyer is called the long, and the seller is called the short . Futures contracts are “ zero 
sum games ”.  
Concept  
 Futures contracts - a customized contract to buy (sell) an 
asset at a specified date and a specified price (futures price). 
The contract is traded on an organized exchange, and the 
potential gain / loss is realized each day (marking to market).  
 
The forward contract  is a private agreement between the two parties and nothing happens 
between the contracting date and the date of delivery.  
Concept  
 Forward contract - a customized contract to buy (sel l) and 
asset at a specified date and a specified price (forward price. 
No payment takes place until maturity.   
Forwards and futures contracts markets include diverse instruments on:  
 Currencies;  
 Commodities;  
 Interest rate futures;  
 Short -term deposits;  
 Bond s; 
 Stock futures;  
 Stock index futures;  
 Single stock futures (contract for difference).  
There is no money exchanged when the contract is signed. To ensure that each party 
fulfills its commitments, a margin deposit  is required. The exchanges set a minimum 
margin for each contract and revise it periodically. Margin is determined depending upon 
the risk of the individual contract  
Futures prices fluctuate every day. Therefore all contract positions are marked to market  
at the end of every day. If net price movem ents result in gain on a position of the previous 
day, the customer immediately receives cash in the amount of the gain. And vise versa, if 
there is a loss, the customer must cover the loss. As soon as a customer’s account falls  123 below the maintenance margi n, the customer receives a margin call to fill up the initial 
margin. If this is not done immediately, then the broker closes down the position on the 
market.  In effect future contracts are canceled every day and replaced by new contracts 
with a delivery price equal to the new futures price, i.e. the settlement price at the end of 
the day.  
It is rare for a futures contract to be used for the exchange or physical delivery of the 
underlying instruments. Many contracts have no facility for the exchange of the  financial 
instrument. Thus financial futures markets are independent of the underlying cash markets, 
and are operating in parallel to those markets. Most future contracts are closed out by an 
offsetting position  before the delivery occurs.  A long offsets  by going short and the short 
offsets by going long at any time before the delivery date.  
Offsetting does not involve incremental brokerage fees because the fee to establish initial 
short position includes the commission to take the offsetting long positio n, i.e. the round 
trip commission . 
The total number of outstanding contracts is called open interest . For every outstanding 
contract one person is short (has taken a short position) and one is long (has taken a long 
position. If a particular transaction in volves a new long and a new short, the open interest 
increases by one contract. If a transaction involves offsetting by an existing long and 
offsetting by an existing short, the open interest decreases by one contract. However, if a 
transaction is made by offsetting an existing short or long, and if the other side of 
transaction is a new investor, the open interest remains unchanged. Each futures exchange 
has a clearing house to keep track of the short and long positions.  
Concept  
 Open interest  or a financi al instrument at some specified 
future date.  
The main economic function of futures is to provide a means of hedging. A hedger seeks 
to reduce an already existing risk. This risk reduction could be achieved by taking a futures 
position that would provide p rofit in the event of a loss on the underlying position (and a 
loss in the case of a profit on the underlying position).  
Concept  
 Long hedge – a long anticipatory hedge generally involving 
buying futures contracts in anticipation of spot purchase . 
 
Concep t 
 Short hedge – a short hedge involves selling futures 
contracts to cover the risk on a position in the spot market. 
This is the most common use of hedging in investment 
management . 
The most common products underlying futures contracts are foreign curren cies (exchange 
rates), interest rates on notional amounts of capital, and stock exchange indices. The 
futures contracts are themselves tradable – that is, they can be bought and sold in futures 
markets. To increase their tradability, futures contracts are standardized in terms of both 
time period and amount. They specify the quantity and quality of the underlying product, 
the agreed price and the date of delivery.  
The procedure of marking to market of futures contract, which implies that all potential 
profi ts and losses are immediately realized, is the basis for the key difference between the 
forward and future contracts.  
A forward contract may or may not be marked to market. Where the counterparties are two 
high-credit -quality entities, the two parties may agree not to mark positions to market.  124 However, if one or both of the parties are concerned with the counterparty risk of the 
other, then positions may be marked to market. When a forward contract is not marked to 
market, then there are no interim cash flo ws. 
Because there is no clearinghouse that guarantees the performance of a counterparty in a 
forward contract, the parties to a forward contract are exposed to counterparty risk, the 
risk that the other party to the transaction will fail to perform.  
When hedging the specified source of risk two questions have to be answered:  
 Which contract should be used?  
 What amount should be hedged?  
The answer to the first question depends upon the source of risk, which will dictate the use 
of some specific stock market index, interest rate or currency contract.  
The answer to the second question depends upon optimal hedge ratio to be used .  
The hedge ratio is the ratio of the size of the (short) position to be taken in futures contract 
to the size of the exposure (the val ue of the portfolio to be hedged).  
Hedge ratio = ( Number of contracts x Size x Spot price ) / V  
where V – is the market value of the underlying asset position.  
The number of contracts to be sold if hedge ratio, that is to be implemented, is known, can 
be derived from this equation:  
 N = Hedge ratio x V / ( Size x Spot price)  
Example  
 Assume the manager of a futures fund has 1000000 Euro. 
The fund manager buys FTSE 100 futures relating to 
1000000 of shares when the FTSE 100 stands at 5000.The 
futures matur e in one year.  
Let’s determine the key characteristic of the contract  
The number of futures contracts bought will be equal:  
1,000,000/(5000 x 10) = 20 contracts  
Does any of the 1000000Euro need to be used in the purchase 
of the futures? Yes, the initial ma rgin must be provided  
The approximate capital gain on the fund over a year, if the 
FTSE 100 rises by 7%, will be equal to 7% (minus the net 
cost of carry).  
In order to find the total return on the fund, interest on the 
money on deposit plus interest on mai ntenance margin (i.e. 
interest on approximately 1,000,000) should be added to the 
capital gain.  
 
6.3.2.  Forward and futures valuation  
Valuation of all derivative models are based on arbitrage arguments. This involves 
developing a strategy or a trade wherein a p ackage consisting of a position in the 
underlying (that is, the underlying asset or instrument for the derivative contract) and 
borrowing or lending so as to generate the same cash flow as the derivative. The value of 
the package is then equal to the theor etical price of the derivative. If the market price of  125 the derivative deviates from the theoretical price, then the actions of arbitrageurs will drive 
the market price of the derivative toward its theoretical price until the arbitrage 
opportunity is elimin ated.  
The pricing of futures and forward contracts is similar. If the underlying asset for both 
contracts is the same, the difference in pricing is due to differences in features of the 
contract that must be dealt with by the pricing model.  
A futures price  equals the spot (cash market) price at delivery, though not during the life of 
the contract. The difference between the two prices is called the basis : 
Basis = Futures price – Spot price = F – S 
The basis is often expressed as a percentage of the spot pri ce (discount or premium) =  
Percentage basis =  ( F – S ) / S  
Futures valuation models determine the theoretical value of the basis. This value is 
constraint by the existence of profitable riskless arbitrage between the futures and spot 
markets for the asse t. 
In a well -functioning market, when arbitrageurs implement their strategy by selling the 
futures and buying underlying asset, this would force the futures price down so that at 
some price for the futures contract, the arbitrage profit is eliminated. This  strategy that 
results in the capturing of the arbitrage profit is referred to as a cash-and-carry trade . The 
reason for this name is that implementation of the strategy involves borrowing cash to 
purchase the underlying asset and “carrying” that underlyin g asset to the settlement date of 
the futures contract.  
In general, the formula for determining the theoretical price of the contract, assuming that 
lending and borrowing rates are both the same and equal to financing cost, and that there is 
no margin,  be comes:  
Theoretical futures price = Spot price + ( Spot price) x (Financing cost  - Cash yield)  
where financing cost -  is the interest rate to borrow funds, cash yield -  is the payment 
received from investing in the asset (e.g. dividend) as a percentage of  the cash price.  
Example  
 Assume that the underlying asset price is 100 Euro, financing 
cost is 1% and cash yield is 2%. Then the theoretical futures 
price is:   100 Euro + [100 Euro × (1% − 2%)] = 99 Euro  
The future price can be above or below the spot (cash) price depending on the difference 
between the financing cost and cash yield. The difference between these rates is called the 
cost of carry  and determines the net financing cost . 
Positive carry  means that the cash yield exceeds the financing cost, while the difference 
between the financing cost and the cash yield is a negative value.  
Negative carry means that the financing cost exceeds the cash yield.  
Zero futures  happen when the futures price is equal to the spot (cash) price.  
At the settlement date of the futures contract, the futures price must equal the s pot (cash 
market) price. The reason is that a futures contract with no time left until delivery is 
equivalent to a s pot (cash market) transaction. Therefore, as the delivery date approaches, 
the futures price is converging to the s pot (cash market) price. This happens as financing 
cost and the yield that can be earned by holding the underlying asset, and finally the cost 
of carry, approaches zero, when the delivery date approaches.   126 However, th e borrowing rate is usually higher than the lending rate. The impact of this 
difference is important when defining theoretical futures price.  
In the cash -and-carry trade, the theoretical futures price based on borrowing rate becomes  
Theoretical futures pri ce = Spot price + ( Spot price) ×(Borrowing rate -Cash yield)  
In the reverse cash -and-carry trade, the theoretical futures price based on lending rate 
becomes:  
Theoretical futures price = Spot price + ( Spot price)×(Lending rate - Cash yield)  
Both equations together provide a band between which the actual futures price can exist 
without allowing for an arbitrage profit. The first equation establishes the upper value for 
the band while the second equation provides the lower value for the band.  
The reverse cas h-and-strategy  trade requires the short selling of the underlying. It is 
assumed in this strategy that the proceeds from the short sale are received and reinvested. 
In practice, for individual investors, the proceeds are not received, and, in fact, the 
individual investor is required to deposit margin (securities margin and not futures margin) 
to short sell. For institutional investors, the underlying may be borrowed, but there is a cost 
to borrowing. This cost of borrowing can be incorporated into the mode l by reducing the 
cash yield on the underlying.  
For strategies applied to stock index futures, a short sale of the components stocks in the 
index means that all stocks in the index must be sold simultaneously. This may be difficult 
to do and therefore wou ld widen the band for the theoretical future price.  
For valuation of stock index futures the fair value premium is used.  
The excess of the fair futures price over the spot (i.e. actual) stock index is called the fair 
value premium. The formula for the fair  value premium is:  
FP = I x [{(r - y)/100} x{d/365}]  
where FP is the fair value premium,  I is the spot FTSE 100 Index, r is the interest rate, y is 
the expected percentage dividend yield on the index portfolio, and d is the number of days 
to maturity of t he futures contract.  
Exercise  
 Assume that the rate of interest on risk -free bank deposits 
were 2.5% p.a.. If money could be borrowed at the same rate 
of interest, estimate the price of a FTSE 100 futures contract 
which matures in four months on the basis  of a spot index of 
4000 and a zero expected rate of dividend yield on the FTSE 
100 portfolio. How would the answer change if the expected 
rate of dividend yield were 0.5% p.a. (while the other values 
were as before)?  
Short cash and carry involves selling  the borrowed stock and buying futures. In this case 
the excess of interest over dividends is a net inflow and this gain should be matched by 
having a guaranteed future purchase price that exceeds the spot sale price by the amount of 
this net inflow. The m oney from the stock sale is put on deposit. In the case of short 
selling, the borrower of the stock must pay sums equivalent to the dividends to the lender 
of the stock. The excess of interest over dividends is a net inflow that should be matched 
by a capi tal loss guaranteed by the futures price.  
Exercise  
 Assume a fund manager has 10000000 Euro for a futures 
fund. The fund has an investment horizon of one year. The 
FTSE 100 stands at 5000.The one -year interest rate is 4% and 
the expected rate of dividend yield on the FTSE 100 over the  127 coming year is 2%.The fund manager puts 10000000 Euro in 
a bank deposit and obtains market exposure by buying FTSE 
100 futures.  
a) How many futures contracts, with a one -year maturity, are 
required for a fund that has a 10000 000 Euro exposure to the 
FTSE 100?  
b) What is the fair futures price?  
c) What is the rate of capital gain on the fund if the FTSE 100 
rises by 6% over the year, and the futures price is initially at 
its fair level?  
d) What is the total return on the fund i f the FTSE 100 rises 
by 6% over the year?  
e) How would the answers to (a),(c), and (d) change if the 
futures contracts were to provide a market exposure of 
20000000 Euro (while the sum of money on deposit remains 
at 10000000 Euro)?  
f) Is it the case that t he whole of the 10000000 Euro can be 
kept in a bank deposit?  
 
Exercise  
 Assume that the FTSE 100 is 4500, the three -month interest 
rate is 3% p.a., and the expected rate of dividend  
yield on the FTSE 100 over the next three months is 2% p.a.  
a) What is t he fair price of a futures contract due to mature in 
three months?  
b) If financial institutions face transaction costs of 0,1% on 
both purchases and sales of stock, plus 0,2% tax on 
purchases, what is the no -arbitrage band of futures prices?  
c) If speculat ors expect that the FTSE 100 will be 4700 in 
three months from the present, what would you expect to 
happen in the futures and spot markets?  
 
6.3.3.  Use of forwards and futures  
Going long or short in futures market without any offsetting position is described a s taking 
a speculative position . 
In a futures hedge  an investor offsets a position in the cash (spot) market with a nearly 
opposite position in the futures market. The objective is to reduce the overall risk position. 
The hedged position has lower expected  return than an unhedged position.  
In a long hedge  the investor takes a long position in futures. In a short hedge  the investor 
takes a short position in futures. A very important type of hedge occurs when an investor 
with the long position in the spot ma rket simultaneously take a short position in the futures 
contracts.  
In short hedging the hedger may be able to find a futures contract for a virtually identical 
item as hedgers cash (spot) position. Then the gains (losses) in the spot market are offset 
by the gains (losses) in the futures market. This offset is shown in the figure  bellow.   128 Figure 15 . Profit profile for perfect hedge  
The Figure 15 provides profit profiles. Assume, the investor goes long in the  spot market 
at 50 Euro. As the spot price increases (decreases) the investor gains (loses) exactly the 
same amount. The profit profile for a spot position is offset exactly by t he short futures 
position. P rofit profile for the net position is a horizontal  line, indicating no change in the 
value of the net position a s the spot price changes. F lat profile represents a perfect hedge.   
However most often identical or similar future contracts do not exist. In this situation, the 
hedger must utilize a short pos ition in a similar, but different asset. This is called a cross 
hedge . The relationship between a spot position and a futures contract in a cross hedge is 
not a perfect straight line. It is shown as a dotted line in the figure below. Here it is 
assumed tha t the investor takes a long position in the spot market in grade A investment 
assets, and offsets by taking short position in the futures market in grade B investment 
assets. Grade B asset prices are assumed to move half as fast as grade A asset prices. Th e 
Figure 16 shows profit profile for long spot grade A investment assets, short futures grade 
B investment assets and the net position. The gains and losses on the spot position are cut 
in half for grade A investment assets by the sho rt hedge.

The hedger can estimate the slope of the line (β) by using r egression analysis in order to 
find the best -fitting relationship. For every unit of the spot asset (cash market),  the hedger 
shorts β units of the futures. β is called the optimal hedge ratio.  
Exercise  
 Assume a fund manager anticipates the receipt of 5 million 
Euro in one month. The intention is to invest the money 
equally between the three stocks X, Y, and Z. Thes e stocks 
have betas of 0,9, 1,1, and 1,3 respectively. The FTSE 100 is 
equal now to 8800.How can the fund manager hedge against 
a rise in stock prices using futures?  
The optimal hedge ratio is not a perfect hedge, because the link between the spot and 
futures is not perfect. The optimal hedge ratio is the best in the sense that the expected 
change in the hedged position is zero.  
6.3.4.  Futures contracts: stock index futures  
For stock index futures the deliverable commodity (underlying asset) is a common stock 
index. Some stock index futures are actively traded contracts.  
The stock index future price depends upon the value of the stocks in the index, the 
dividends on these stocks, and the interest rate until the delivery date on the futures 
contract.  
Arbitrage en sures that the futures contract should be equivalent of a buying the stock in the 
index, borrowing the funds for this purchase, paying interest on the borrowed funds at the 
delivery date, and receiving any dividends.  
F stock = P stock ( 1 + r d ) d – Div 
when  P stock - is the current market value of stocks in the index, r – the spot interest rate 
from now until delivery date, Div – amount of dividends on these stocks.  
Unless the futures price is equal to P stock ( 1 + r d ) d – Div, arbitrage occurs. This a rbitrage 
is called program trading. The figure below illustrates the case, when the futures price is 
above P stock ( 1 + r d ) d – Div.  
Figure 17. Program trading arbitrage  Actual futures  Arbitrage profit  
Theoretical futures  
Spot price  
Time  Price   130  
This arbitrage is to take short position in futures and b uy the stocks in the index. The 
arbitrage position is held until the futures and spot prices are once more in line. Both 
positions are closed for profit.  
Such type of arbitrage involves the purchase and sale of large number of stocks in the 
index. In orde r to uncover the arbitrage opportunity initially, a computer program is 
needed. Afterwards, the buy or sell orders for a large number of stocks must be executed 
rapidly by computer program before the arbitrage profit opportunity disappears.  
 
6.3.5.  Contracts for difference (CFD)  
A contract for difference (CFD) is an instrument that has similarities with a futures 
contract. Frequently it is related to a particular stock, but could relate to any marketable 
asset (or even non -marketable instruments such as stock indi ces).  
CFD contracts do not have fixed expiry dates and can be closed at any time. A CFD is a 
deal between an investor and a broker. The investor is expected to pay a deposit (typically 
10% of the value of the shareholding to which the CFD is related). If l osses are made from 
the transaction, the broker takes cash from the deposit (margin) and the investor is required 
to provide more cash in order to maintain the value of the deposit at 10%. If the position 
makes a profit, the investor receives cash.  
An inve stor who takes a long position in a CFD relating to a share would profit from a 
share price rise, and lose in the event of a share price fall. The profits or losses would be 
calculated by reference to a specified share price (typically slightly above the s hare price 
when the contract was entered into; the offer price of the share might be used). If the share 
price were above the specified price, there would be a profit equal to the difference 
between the current price and the specified price.  
Conversely, t here would be a loss equal to the extent to which the current stock price is 
below the specified price. An investor with a long CFD is treated as if the shares are 
bought with borrowed money and the broker can do in the absence of offsetting short 
position s. The investor pays interest and receives dividends.  
An investor who takes a short position in a CFD profits from price falls and loses from 
price rises. The extent of profit or loss is based on the difference between the current share 
price and a share p rice slightly below the share price at the time that the contract was 
entered into. The bid price of the share might be used also.  
An investor with a short CFD is treated as if the shares are sold short and the receipts are 
put on deposit. The investor re ceives interest and pays sums equal to the share dividends. 
Bid/offer prices might be quoted.  
Potential losses are very large in the event of prices moving heavily against the 
anticipations of an investor. The use of stop -loss order ensures automatic closu re of a 
position in the event of a price movement beyond a particular level. However, there is a 
risk that the price movement is so rapid, that closure occurs only after the price has moved 
significantly beyond the chosen stop -loss price.  
A broker, who is providing CFDs, can take corresponding positions in the share. However 
if a broker has investors on both the long and short sides, the need to take positions in the 
share is reduced since the cash flows of long and short investors would match each other. 
Some concern has been expressed that if investors use CFDs as a substitute for share 
purchases, liquidity is taken from the stock market. Although brokers take offsetting  131 positions in the stock market, liquidity is reduced to the extent that there is matchi ng 
between long and short positions.  
By using CFDs investors can obtain leveraged investments or short positions on a share (or 
other instrument).An almost identical alternative to CFDs is spread betting.  
 
6.4. Swaps  
A swap  is an agreement whereby two parties ( called counterparties ) agree to exchange 
periodic payments. The cash amount of the payments exchanged is based on some 
predetermined principal amount, which is called the notional principal amount  or simply 
notional amount . The cash amount each counterpart y pays to the other is the agreed -upon 
periodic rate times the notional amount. The only cash that is exchanged between the 
parties are the agreed -upon payments, not the notional amount.  
A swap is an over -the-counter (OTC) contract. Hence, the counterpart ies to a swap are 
exposed to counterparty risk . 
Swap can be decomposed into a package of derivative instruments, e.g. a package of 
forward contracts. However, its maturity can be longer than that of typical  forward and 
futures contracts, it is negotiated separately, can have quite high liquidity (larger than 
many forward contracts, particularly long -dated (i.e., long -term) forward contracts).  
The types of swaps typically used by non -finance corporations are:  
 interest rate swaps,  
 currency swaps,  
 commodity  swaps, and  
 credit default swaps.  
Interest rate swap  is a contract in which the counterparties swap payments in the same 
currency based on an interest rate. For example, one of the counterparties can pay a fixed 
interest rate and the other party a floati ng interest rate. The floating interest rate is 
commonly referred to as the reference rate . 
Currency swap  is a contract, in which two parties agree to swap payments based on 
different currencies.  
Commodity swap is a contract, according to which the exchang e of payments by the 
counterparties is based on the value of a particular physical commodity. Physical 
commodities include precious metals, base metals, natural gas, crude oil, food.  
A credit default swap  (CDS)  is an OTC derivative that permits the buying and selling of 
credit protection against particular types of events that can adversely affect the credit 
quality of a bond such as the default of the borrower.  
Although it is referred to as a “swap,” it does not have the general characteristics of a 
typica l swap. There are two parties in the CDS contract: the credit protection buyer and 
credit protection seller . Over the life of the CDS, the protection buyer agrees to pay the 
protection seller a payment at specified dates to insure against the impairment of  the debt 
of a reference entity due to a credit -related event. The reference entity is a specific issuer. 
The specific credit -related events are identified in the contract that will trigger a payment 
by the credit protection seller to the credit protection  buyer are referred to as credit events . 
If a credit event does occur, the credit protection buyer only makes a payment up to the 
credit event date and makes no further payment. At this time, the protection buyer is  132 obligated to fulfill its obligation. The  contract will call for the protection seller to 
compensate for the loss in the value of the debt obligation  
 
6.5. Options  
6.5.1.  Options definition  
An option  is a contract in which the option seller grants the option buyer the right to enter 
into a transaction with t he seller to either buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified 
price on or before a specified date.  
Options, like other financial instruments, may be traded either on an organized exchange 
or in the over -the-counter (OTC) market.  
The specified price i s called the strike price  or exercise price  and the specified date is 
called the expiration date .  
The option seller grants this right in exchange for a certain amount of money called the 
option premium or option price. The option seller is also known as t he option writer, while 
the option buyer is the option holder.  
The asset that is the subject of the option is called the underlying . The underlying can be 
an individual stock, a stock index, a bond, or even another derivative instrument such as a 
futures contract.  
The option writer can grant the option holder one of two rights. If the right is to purchase 
the underlying, the option is a call option . If the right is to sell the underlying, the option 
is a put option . 
.Concept  
 Call options: Options that g ive the right to buy a given 
amount of a financial instrument or commodity at an agreed 
price within a specified time but, like all options, do not 
oblige investors to do so.  
 
Concept  
 Put options: Options that give the right to sell a given 
amount of a financial instrument or commodity at an agreed 
price within a specified time, but that do not oblige investors 
to do so.  
An option can also be categorized according to when it may be exercised by the buyer or 
the exercise style:  
 European option can only b e exercised at the expiration date of the contract.  
 American option  can be exercised any time on or before the expiration date.  
 Bermuda option or Atlantic option – is an option which can be exercised 
before the expiration date but only on specified dates  is called . 
The terms of exchange are represented by the contract unit and are standardized for most 
contracts. The option holder enters into the contract with an opening transaction. 
Subsequently, the option holder then has the choice to exercise or to se ll the option. The 
sale of an existing option by the holder is a closing sale.  
A profit profile for a call option is provided in the figure bellow. Suppose an investor is 
buying a bond, which is currently selling at its exercise price of 100 Euro, and hol ds this 
bond for three months until the option expires. Possible profits or losses will be on the 
solid line. If a call option costs 4 Euro, this will be the maximum loss for a call option  133 buyer. If the bond price at expiration is above the exercise, the p rofit equals P – E – 4 
Euro.  
 
Figure 18. Profit profiles for a call option  
The maximum profit that the option writer can realize is the option price. The option buyer 
has substantial upside return potential, while the option write r has substantial downside 
risk.  
The described call option is called a naked call option. This is a risky position because the 
potential of loss is unbound.  
Another less risky contract is writing a covered call. Such a contract involves the purchase 
of the underlying security and the writing of a call option on that security.  Profit profile 
for the covered call is shown in the  Figure 19.  If a call option is profitable, then it it is 
exercised and the covered call writer must sell t he underlying security at the exercise price 
(100 Euro). The maximum gain is 4 Euro, i.e. the original sale price of the call option. If 
the call option is unprofitable, the covered call option writer receives 4 Euro for writing 
the call, and this reduces the loss from owning the underlying security.  
The purchase of a call option creates a position referred to as a long call position . 
The writer of a call option is said to be in a short call position . 
The buying of a put option  creates a financial position referred to as a long put position .  
The profit or loss for this position at the expiration date depends on the market price of the 
underlying asset. As with all long option positions, the loss is limited to the option price. 
The profit potential, however,  is substantial: The theoretical maximum profit is generated 
if asset’s  price falls to zero.  
Writing a put option  creates a position referred to as a short put position . The profit and 
loss profile for a short put option is the opposite of the long put o ption. The maximum 
profit from this position is the option price.  100

The theoretical maximum loss can be substantial, if the price of the underlying falls. If the 
price fa lls to zero, the loss would be as large as the exercise price less the option price.

   135 To summarize, buying calls or selling puts allows the investor to gain if the price of the 
underlying asset rises. Selling calls and buying puts allows the investor to gain if the price 
of the underlying asset falls.  
 
6.5.2.  Components of the Option Price  
The theoretical price of an option is made up of two components:  
 intrinsic value;  
 premium over intrinsic value.  
The intrinsic value is the option’s economic value if it is exercised immediately. If no 
positive economic value would result from exercising immediately, the intrinsic va lue is 
zero.  
For a call option, the intrinsic value is the difference between the current market price of 
the underlying and the strike price. If that difference is positive, then the intrinsic value 
equals that difference; if the difference is zero or ne gative, then the intrinsic value is equal 
to zero.  
Concept  Intrinsic value of an option: The profit available from 
immediately exercising an option. Where the value of the 
right granted by the option is equal to the market value of the 
underlying instrum ent (the intrinsic value is zero), the option 
is said to be at-the-money.  If the intrinsic value is positive, 
the option is in-the-money . If exercising an option would 
produce a loss, it is out-of-the-money.  
For a put option, the intrinsic value is equal to the amount by which the underlying’s 
market price is below the strike price.  
Time premium  of an option, or time value of the option , is the amount by which the 
option’s market price exceeds its intrinsic value. It is the expectation of the option buyer  
that at some time before the expiration date the changes in the market price of the 
underlying asset will increase the value of the rights of the option. Because of this 
expectation, the option buyer is willing to pay a premium above the intrinsic value.  
An option buyer has two ways to realize the value of an option position.  
The first way is by exercising the option. The second way is to sell the option in the 
market.  
Put-Call Parity Relationship.  For a European put and a European call option with the 
same underlying,  strike price, and expiration date, there is a relationship between the price 
of a call option, the price of a put option, the price of the underlying, and the strike price. 
This relationship is known as the put-call parity relationship .  
The relationship is equal to:  
Put option price − Call option price = Present value of strike price + Present value of cash 
distribution − Price of underlying asset  
Put-call parity implies that:  
Call option price >= Put option price - Lending present value of exercise price  
The value Put option price - Lending present value of exercise price  has been called 
Merton’s lower bound . It follows that the cash flows from buying a call option can never 
be less than buying the underlying security and borrowing the underlying value of the  136 exercis e price. Merton’s bound is illustrated in the   Figure 21. As the price of the 
underlying asset rises, the value of the call approaches Merton’s bound, and consequently, 
the value of a put gets very small. When the price of the underl ying asset is small, the 
value of the call option is small, and the value of a put becomes large.  
  Figure 21. Merton‘s bound  
 
6.5.3.  Determinants of the Option Price  
The factors that affect the price of an option include:  
 Market price o f the underlying asset.  
 Strike (exercise) price of the option.  
 Time to expiration of the option.  
 Expected volatility of the underlying asset over the life of the option.  
 Short -term, risk -free interest rate over the life of the option.  
 Anticipated cash paym ents on the underlying over the life of the option.  
The impact of each of these factors may depend on whether (1) the option is a call or a put, 
and (2) the option is an American option or a European option.  
Market price of the underlying asset.  The optio n price will change as the price of the 
underlying asset changes. For a call option, as the underlying assets’s price increases (all 
other factors being constant), the option price increases. The opposite holds for a put 
option, i.e. as the price of the un derlying increases, the price of a put option decreases.

  137 The exercise price is fixed for the life of the option. All other factors being equal, the 
lower the exercise price, the higher the price for a call option. For put options, the higher 
the exercise price, the higher the option price.  
Time to expiration of the option.  After the expiration date, an option has no value. All 
other factors being equal, the longer the time to expiration of the option, the higher the 
option price. Th is is because, as the time to expiration decreases, less time remains for the 
underlying asset’s price to rise (for a call buyer) or fall (for a put buyer), and therefore the 
probability of a favorable price movement decreases. Consequently, as the time re maining 
until expiration decreases, the option price approaches its intrinsic value. The impact of 
longer remaining life is shown in Figure 22

being equal, the greater the expecte d volatility (as measured by the standard deviation or 
variance) of the underlying, the more the option buyer would be willing to pay for the 
option, and the more an option writer would demand for it. This occurs because the greater 
the expected volatility , the greater the probability that the movement of the underlying will 
change so as to benefit the option buyer at some time before expiration.  
Figure 24. Impact of higher interest rate on value of call option  
Short -term, risk -free interest rate  over the life of the option. Buying the underlying 
asset requires an investment of funds. Buying an option on the same quantity of the 
underlying makes the difference between the underlying’s price and the option price 
available for investme nt at an interest rate at least as high as the risk -free rate. 
Consequently, all other factors being constant, the higher the short -term, risk -free interest 
rate, the greater the cost of buying the underlying asset and carrying it to the expiration 
date of  the call option. Hence, the higher the short -term, risk -free interest rate, the more 
attractive the call option will be relative to the direct purchase of the underlying. As a 
result, the higher the short -term, risk -free interest rate, the greater the pri ce of a call option.  
Anticipated cash payments on the underlying  over the life of the option cash payments 
on the underlying tend to decrease the price of a call option. The cash payments make it 
more attractive to hold the underlying than to hold the opt ion. For put options, cash 
payments on the underlying tend to increase the price.  
 
6.5.4.  Option pricing models  
An option pricing model uses a set of assumptions and arbitrage arguments to derive a 
theoretical price for an option. Deriving a theoretical option pr ice is much more 
complicated than deriving a theoretical futures or forward price because the option price 
depends on the expected volatility of the underlying over the life of the option.  
Several models have been developed to determine the theoretical pr ice of an option. The 
most popular one was developed by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes (1973) for valuing 
European call options on common stock.

Call and put options and the buying and writing of options can be combin ed to try to profit 
from expected conditions in the market. Some of such strategies are as follows:  
Cases where a trader either buys or writes options but does not do both  
Straddle – a call and a put at the same strike price and expiry date  
Strangle – a call and a put for the same expiry date but at different strike prices  
Strap – two calls and one put with the same expiry dates; the strike prices might be the 
same or different  
Strip – two puts and one call with the same expiry date; again strike prices mig ht be the 
same or different  
In general, the buyer of these options is hoping for market prices to move sharply but is 
uncertain whether they will rise or fall. The buyer of a strap gains more from a price rise 
than from a price fall; the buyer of a strip g ains more from a price fall. The writer in all 
four cases is hoping that the market will remain stable, with little change in price during 
the life of the option.  
Spreads: combinations of buying and writing options  
Butterfly – buying two call options, one with a low exercise price, the other with a high 
exercise price, and writing two call options with the same intermediate strike price or the 
reverse.  
Condor – similar to a butterfly, except that the call options which are written have 
different intermediat e prices.  
Both a butterfly and a condor are vertical spreads – all options bought or sold have the 
same expiry date but different strike prices. Horizontal spreads have the same strike prices 
but different expiry dates. With diagonal spreads both the strik e prices and the expiry dates 
are different. Other mixed strategies have equally improbable names. They include vertical 
bull call; vertical bull spread; vertical bear spread; rotated vertical bull spread; rotated 
vertical bear spread.  
 
6.6. Summary  
The need fo r sophisticated risk management in the face of highly volatile exchange rates 
provides one of the principal reasons for the growth of derivatives markets. These allow 
firms to hedge risk by taking out contracts in derivatives markets, which carry the oppos ite 
risk to that which they face in the underlying markets. The principal types of derivatives 
are futures, forwards, swaps and options. Futures promise the delivery of an underlying 
asset of a specified kind on a given date, although delivery is seldom ma de. 
Options give the right to buy and/or sell an underlying asset, although that right need not 
be taken up. In order to increase tradability, futures and options are highly standardised. 
Both offer the possibility of very high rates of profit. Futures do this through the system of 
margin payments. In the case of options, this occurs because buyers of options pay only 
the premium for the right to trade at the specified price.  
Derivative contracts are offered in relation to exchange rates, short -term and lon g-term 
interest rates and stock exchange indices. They are widely used for speculation as well as 
for risk management. In recent years, options have become extremely complicated, with 
new forms of options contracts appearing regularly.   140 Forward and futures  contracts are likely to provide cheaper protection against loss than 
options, but remove the profit opportunity if prices move in favour of the firm. Thus, 
options are generally preferable if the hedger is uncertain about the direction the price of 
the un derlying asset is likely to move. A hedger who is confident about the direction in 
which the price will move is more likely to choose forward or futures contracts or remain 
in an open position and accept the risk of a price change.  
A trader who is confide nt that the price will fall may (a) sell the product before the price 
falls; (b) take an offsetting short position by selling futures contracts; or (c) sell the 
currency forwards. This eliminates entirely her exposure to the price fall.  
A trader who is un certain in which direction the price will move may choose options. Even 
then, if she thinks that the price is more likely to fall than to rise, financial futures are 
preferable to options because they are likely to offer her cheaper protection. Options are  
preferable if the trader has no view or thinks that the price is more likely to rise than fall.  
Derivatives markets have been controversial in recent years. Many companies have 
experienced losses badly in these markets, and fears about causing serious pro blems for 
the international financial system  continue to be widespread

Review questions and problems  
1. Consider the relative advantages and disadvantages of using forward contracts, 
futures contracts and options as m eans of speculation.  
2.  How do futures markets seek to protect themselves and their clients against 
default risk?  
3. Why might the increased protection provided to individual traders by the 
derivatives markets increase the risk of the whole financial system run ning into 
difficulties?  
4. Why did the US central bank (the Federal Reserve) feel the need to rescue a 
privately owned and run hedge fund (LTCM) in late 1998? Should public 
resources be used in this way?  
5.  How many ways are there of a Latvian investor going sh ort in US dollars or 
giving itself the opportunity of going short? Why might a Latvian investor wish 
to go short in US dollars?  
6. Why is it more risky to write (sell) options contracts than to buy them?  
7. Consider the following statement: A speculator who felt  that interest rates were 
likely to rise or a currency’s value decline would go short in the relevant asset 
by selling a futures contract.  
a) Why would a speculator go short rather than long in these two cases?  
b) What does going short in interest rates me an? 
c) How does selling a futures contract allow one to go short?
