Introduction 
This book  is a simple,  pract ical gu ide to swing trading .  For years I have been 
reading books and exploring web sites that are dedicated to swing trading.  Yet, I 
could not fi nd any si mple description of how to enter and exi t a trade.  So I 
developed some basic rules that have  been published on my web site 
www.mrswi ng.com .  I call t hese ru les The Master Plan .  Over the years, thousands 
of investors have used my Master Plan to swing trade .  It is my fi rm bel ief that a 
swing trader  must trade w ith disciplin e.  While it is import ant to keep things 
simple,  the rules of  the Master Plan  might seem a l ittle intimidating.  The mai n 
reason I wrote this book was to make swing trading more accessible to the 
beginner.  These rational behind swing trading and th e entry and exit rules are 
presen ted very clearly  – bot h the begin ner and the experien ced sw ing trader will now 
have a simple gu ide to follow. 
To quote Albert Einstein:  "Things shoul d be made as simple as possible, but not 
any simpler" .  This is t he prin ciple I f ollowed while writing this book . 
 
q  Why does swing trading work? 
Because you are trading in the direction of the trend.  You 
wait for a pul lback before enteri ng the trade, and you enter 
only if the stock shows a sign  that it’s price w ill con tinue in 
the di rection of the trend. 
 
The main objective of a swing trader  is to profi t from swings  in price 
movement over the course of several days.  While we might trade every day, we are 
not day traders.  As swing traders , we have the patience to wait until our prof it 
goals h ave been  reach ed.  Fortunately, the wait is not too lon g.  A typical t rade is 
only in play from a few days to a few weeks.  When a trade i s closed, the funds go 
into the next trade. 
Money management i s very i mportant i n swing trading.  I divide my trading 
capital by 15.  Thi s is the amount that I put into each trade.  As the total  account 
grows, the amount of each trade grows.  If you can handl e a larger number of 
 Visit:  http://www.mrswing.com/      or      emai l: larry@mrswi ng.com A Pract ical Gu ide to Swin g Trading by Larry Swi ng 
trades, you mi ght increase the number of trad es that are acti ve to 20.  Of course 
you can also start with 2 or 3 trades at a time. 
Each day I i dentify 20 to 25 candi dates for swi ng tradi ng.  If I have 10 trades 
active and enough addi tional investment capi tal for 5 more trades, I pi ck the best 10 
from my  list of 25, and place t he orders.   Only some of  orders w ill get  filled.  I don ’t 
worry about runni ng out of money – i f there i s no cash l eft in the account, addi tional 
orders w ill simply  not get filled.  (Make sure that your own accou nt works this way, 
otherwise, your brokerage f irm migh t fill the order an d expect addit ional funds within 
the next few days.) 
You must make a personal de cision as to whether you want to trade on margi n 
or not.  If you are more con servative, you will only trade w ith the cash  that you have 
on hand.  As I discuss later in the book, margin is necessary for selling stocks 
short , so it is import ant to have your account approved for margi n tradi ng, even i f 
you don’t pl an to trade on margi n. 
The stocks I i dentify as good swing trading  opportunities are made available 
each day through my MasterSwings service.  Once a week, my picks are made 
available on  my website – www.mrswi ng.com  – or by e-mai l, through my free 
MrSwing Lite  service. 
Swing trading should be bot h profitable an d fun.  Through the guidelin es 
outlined in this book , you can achieve both of these simple objectives.

2 About the book 
2.1 Who should read this book 
• If you (l ike many i nvestors) are di senchanted wi th buy-and-hol d investing, 
swing trading may  be righ t for you.  Even if you invested in great  compan ies, 
it is likely that the value of your investments has dimin ished su bstantially 
over the past few years. 
• If you’re not a stock mark et expert, yet would still like to make money in the 
stock market. 
• Day trading requ ires bot h stock mark et expertise an d the abilit y to constantly 
watch the market.  If day trading  is not for you, swing trading  might 
satisfy your needs. 
• If you are disciplin ed an d patient – the swing trading met hodology  outlined in 
this book  will teach you how to trade su ccessf ully with very little risk .  
However, you must careful ly follow the Master Plan,  and you must be 
patient – prof its come slow ly, but surely.  The total value of your investment 
accou nt will go u p.  This is in  sharp con trast to the buy-and-hold st rategy, 
where losing money is more commo n than we woul d like to admi t. 
 
Swing trading  allow s you to accumulate small gain s weekly, ultimately making 
money through a disciplin ed, low-risk trading approach .  While sw ing trading is n ot 
for everyone, this book  will help you determine if swing trading is righ t for you.  It 
provides a treasure map to the pot of gol d which is found at the end of the rai nbow.

2.4 Prefaces 
Suri Duddella, siXer.com  
Traders and investors study markets throug h price charts.  These powerful visual 
tools offer a common l anguage for al l stocks, options, and indices.  The theory 
behind this is called Technical Analysis .  Technical Analysis  begins with a simple 
observati on that al l market acti vity is reflected i n the acti vity of pri ce and vol ume 
over time.  These three pieces of informatio n create a profound vi sual representation 
when properly presented in a chart. 
Prices rise an d fall, with rising prices bein g stimulated by  greed an d falling prices by  
the awakening of fear.  This emot ional war between greed and fear generates a 
swinging price movement that pr ovides a perfect opportunity for swing trading .  
Swing Traders  capit alize on the emot ions of others while they caref ully control their 
own emot ions and systematically enter and exit trades.  Swing Traders recognize the 
levels of support and resistance.  They understand the concepts of momentum and 
volatility and can  identify a trading range or ch annel.

Equity trading provides a natural arena for Swing Traders .  As price seeks an 
equilibriu m state, Swing Traders seek  to exploit direct  price t hrusts as t hey enter 
positions at support and resi stance.  By examining chart pattern characteristics they 
make money in both trending and range bo und markets.  Swing Trading is a classic 
strategy that involves holding stocks for a short peri od of ti me, typi cally between a 
few days to a few weeks.  Unl ike day tradi ng, Swing Trading is independent of time – 
nevertheless, some Sw ing Traders w ill exit a slow -moving posit ion and mov e onto 
the next opportuni ty. 
Swing Trading is very popular among short-te rm and medi um-term traders.  It offers 
many vi rtues compared to the hyperacti vity of day trading.  With recent changes in  
SEC regul ations that affect the way brokerage fi rms admi nister margi n to 'Day 
Trading' accounts, many day traders have  moved away from day trading towards a 
swing trading style. 
Larry Swing has developed a wonderful software program called SwingTracker  that 
allows users to scan all list ed stocks using his Swing Trade Identifiers to identify 
swing tradi ng opportuni ties.  The program al lows the user to moni tor thei r trades i n 
real-time.  His technica l analysis concepts of EquiVolume  and Force Index  coupled 
with his Swing Trading tactics are a marv elous contri bution to the swi ng tradi ng 
communi ty. 
Larry Swing has mastered the art of Swing Trading .  His websi te – 
www.mrswi ng.com  – not onl y presents the theoreti cal underpi nnings of swi ng 
trading, but provides a detailed road map of how to use them.  This book – A 
Practical Gu ide to Swing Trading – commu nicates the essence of his ideas in a simple 
and straightforward way.  It describes the tools necessary to identify swing trading 
opportunities, and the guidelines n eeded to implement his strategy. 
This book  is filled w ith innovative, import ant trading techniques.  This book  is a great  
asset to both beginner and experienced swing traders.

Nowadays, when the number of online trader s is growi ng very fast, the need for a 
good book is obvious.  Larry’s new book provides a unique combination of 
profession alism an d simplicit y, presen ted in an easy -to-read st yle.  This kind of book  
is currently in short supply. 
Larry writes about real trading situatio ns, expl aining how to reduce ri sks and 
enhance returns.  The book contai ns practi cal exampl es and expl anations how to 
handl e the vari ous scenari os that mi ght ari se.  I feel  comfortabl e sayi ng that thi s is 
the best  pract ical man ual for swing trading that I have ever read.   
His focus on short-term (swing) trading is  very understandable.  In the current, 
turbulent market environment, many people consider “buy-and-hol d” investing to be 
an outdated strategy.  However, they  are not sure what el se to do.  Swing Trading  
offers a real  opportuni ty to produce profi ts while keepi ng risk under control . 
The algorithms that Larry uses in SwingTracker  are great at identifying swing 
trading opportunities – they are extremely valuable to both beginners and 
experienced swing traders.  
Larry covers the whole process of swing tr ading, from soup to nuts.  He even 
recommends brokerage firms that have feat ures whi ch are parti cularly useful  to 
swing traders. 
Not only does t his book  introduce a set  of helpful tools an d tips, it describes w ay of 
thinking about trading and philosophy that a llows the reader to feel confident about 
swing trading which leads to success and profits.

Well, you sure know how to cut the greed,  I almost heard "grab another 
fifty as fast as you can!" Vive le Master  plan, I'll stick to it this week with 
more affordable stocks though! But he y, The Plan is a major "How to".  
When you're through with MA's and Fibonacci toolbox, you got a good feel 
of the music, but still not dancing.   I'm a novice so your money 
management principles are crucial.  Everywhere you read "be careful not 
to be greedy but don't fear, protect yo ur principal" … but HOW?  It's like 
this doctor that always prompted hi s patient to get better and never told 
him how. Guess where the patient is no w!  Although the plan is rather 
"mishna" style, I would have handled prior trades more successfully with 
it.   Arie Bensim on, Israel 
I really do appreciate your web site . I have gone to many others for 
advise/information and always felt th at the message given was lacking.  
After examining your system, your information on how to Swing Trade 
offers a solid but flexible alternative to Swing Trading that I have studied 
in the past.   Ross McKnight, USA

4 An Introduction to Swing Trading 
To make money i n the stock market i t is necessary to have a disci plined approach to 
trading.  We also believ e that it is also import ant to keep things simple.   While ou r 
goal is t o keep things simple,  the trading rules migh t initially seem a bit  complex .  
However, once you learn  the rules an d you trade w ith disciplin e, you will mak e 
money i n the stock market. 
Swing trading allow s you to make money when the mark et is bu llish, or bearish , or 
just going sideways.  That is why it has a distinct advantage over other approaches 
to investing.  The goal  is to make money, not to rest one’s hopes on the future of a 
stock, a sector, or the economy. 
4.1  What is Swing Trading 
Everyone is familiar w ith waves.  A wave alternates from posit ive to negative, then 
to positive and nega tive, and so on.  Waves are fo und in nature – you see waves 
when you throw a rock i nto a lake.  Sound is transmitted in waves.  And when stock 
prices ch ange, they follow a wave-like pattern.  The wave is rarely  as orderly  a sin e 
wave, but they are waves neverthel ess, an d we use these waves in Swing Trading. 
4.2  Let’s Look at an Up Trends 
The chart below shows the price movement  of Myriad Genetics (MYGN) in an 
uptrend.  Noti ce that after the pri ce moves up, it takes a rest, or pulls back.  When 
we swing trade  an uptrend, we buy on the pull-back. 
An uptrend can be identified by a series of  higher highs and high er lows (the bottom 
of each  pull-back). In other words, an uptrend is a series of  successiv e rallies w ith 
each rally going higher than the previous one and each pull-back  stopping above the 
previous one.  
The price movement looks more like the zig- zag of a saw blade than a sinusoid, but 
once an uptrend is established the pa ttern tends to repeat i tself.  In swing trading  
we capit alize on the predict ability of the pattern.  We buy during the pull-back  to 
increase our chances of making a profit.

Figure 1 : up trend  
4.3  Let’s Look at a Down Trend 
The chart below shows the price movement of Verisign (VRSN) in a downtrend.  
Notice that after the pri ce moves down, i t takes a rest , or pu lls up.  The price 
movement follows a zig zag pattern. 
A downtrend  can be i dentified by a seri es of l ower lows and l ower hi ghs (the peak 
of each  pull-up). 
When we swing trade  a downtrend, we sell short  during a pull-up .  If you are 
unfamiliar w ith selling short , we discuss it in the next session.

Figure 2: down trend  
4.4  The Steps in Swing Trading 
First, restrict your select ion to the universe of  stocks that fulfill cert ain criteria.  
Choose stocks that … 
• Have a price of at least $7 
• Have an average daily volume  of at least 500,000 shares 
Then … 
STEP 1 – Identi fy a stock that i s in an uptrend or a downtrend. 
STEP 2 –  For stocks i n an uptrend, i dentify those that are experiencing a pull-back.  
For stocks i n a downtrend, i dentify those that are experiencing a pull-up. 
STEP 3 –  Once an appropriate candidate is id entified, place a limit order to buy 
(uptrend) or sel l short (downtrend) the stock based on the Master Plan. 
STEP 4 –  Once a stock has been traded (a posi tion opened), place a stop-loss order 
to limit downside risk  and place a limit  order t o identify the price at  which 
you will take profits.  (Ideally , these two orders are placed t ogether as an  
 Visit:  http://www.mrswing.com/      or      emai l: larry@mrswi ng.com A Pract ical Gu ide to Swin g Trading by Larry Swi ng 
OCO (One C ancels Other) order; this  is sometimes called an OCA (One 
Cancels All)  order.  
STEP 5 –  At the end of each day, adjust the stop loss prices based on the Master 
Plan. 
4.5 What Can You Expect? 
First –  only a port ion of your trades w ill be ex ecuted.  The Master Plan  is designed 
to only trade st ocks that initially move in the anticipated direct ion.  If the 
price mov es in the opposit e direct ion (continues pulling back  or pu lling 
up), the trade i s not pl aced. 
Second – you will be h olding posit ions for a limit ed amou nt of time.  While swing 
trading  is not day trading, you are on ly holding posit ions until targets are 
met. 
Third –  some of  your trades w ill resu lt in losses,  however losses are min imized by 
the Master Plan which raises the stops as the stock price rises; this is 
known as trailing stops .  Being disciplined, and following the Master 
Plan will insure that profits exceed losses w hich mean s you will make 
money . 
4.6 How Do You Identify Stocks that are Appropriate 
for Swing Trading? 
All of the methods that are used to i dentify stocks that are appropriate for swing 
trading  are based on technical analysis .  Technical an alysis is a w ay of using 
historical price/ volume pat terns to predict  future behavi or.  It is not necessary to 
have a detai led understandi ng of technical analysis  in order t o swing trade .  
There are tools available that can assist in vestors at every l evel – from novi ce to 
expert.  While there are man y sources of  information and tools t hat help iden tify 
swing trading  opport unities, this book  will focus on those prov ided at  
www.mrswi ng.com .  Once you understand the pri nciples, you can expl ore other 
sources of information. 
4.7 What Tools are Available? 
The tools f all into several cat egories.

• Subscript ions serv ices t hat provide daily  swing trading recommen dations – 
www.mrswi ng.com  offers a servi ce called BestSwings .  Larry Swing uses 
technical an alysis and pattern recogn ition software (SwingTracker)  to 
identify candi dates for swing trading .  Every evening, subscribers receive e-
mails that i dentify several  different ty pes of patterns that are conduci ve to 
swing trading .  Aside from showi ng you the pattern, the emai l indicates the 
current price, the entry price, the target  (limit) price f or taking profit, and the 
stop loss price f or limit ing dow nside risk .  This serv ice can  be used by  
investors at  all knowledge lev els. 
An example of a BestSwings  email alert for ZIGO is shown on the next page.  
A candlestick chart shows the recent pr ice acti on, and a tabl e indicates the 
closin g price an d all t hree act ion prices  – the price to buy (using a buy stop 
order), the target price which is 7% above the purchase price (using a buy 
limit order) , and the prot ective stop price w hich is approx imately 4% below  
the purchase price (using a sell stop  order).  The 20- and 50-day moving 
averages (MA) are also shown so that  you can more easily  visualize the 
direction of the trend. 
The rational behind these prices ar e discussed in the section entitled The 
Master Plan .

• Software that scans historical stock prices and identifies swing 
trading patterns – SwingTracker  is a real time charting program available 
at www.mrswi ng.com  that i s designed to i dentify swing trading  
opportunities.  While SwingTracker  has many features (descri bed in the 
Appendix), the scan feature is used to identify stocks whose price action 
show patterns that make them good candi dates for swi ng tradi ng. 
The scan feature al lows you to i dentify patterns based on price history, 
volume history, moving averages,  technical in dicators, candlestick criteria, 
and fundamental company characteristics.  Scan  criteria are sav ed in a scan 
library  so they can be used over and ov er again.  A scan scenarios (also 
called a template ) can be used to evaluate pa tterns in over 6000 stocks on 
the NYSE, the AMEX, and the NASDAQ.  Th is evaluation happens i n real time. 
During the day, you can use SwingTracker  to watch the pri ce and vol ume 
behavior of individual stocks.  You can easily monitor stocks on a favorites  
list, and set al erts to tel l you when pa rticular prices are reached.  These 
features are available from other serv ices, usual ly at a hi gher cost than

5 Pattern Recognition Criteria 
While look ing at a chart can often tell you whether a st ock is appropriat e for swing 
trading , it is very time con suming to look at charts, particularly if you look for 
opportunities every day.  Another way to iden tify good stocks i s to use software that 
can scan all of the listed stocks based on  a series of algebr aic equations that 
represent the characteristics of a good chart pattern.  I use Swi ngTracker to 
accomplish  this task. 
Before discussing the specifics of pattern recognition criteria , we’ll brief ly 
consider the measures used in the algebrai c equations.  Some of the measures are 
simple descriptive variables (e .g., the high price for the previous day  or the average 
volume over the past 20 days).  Other measures are based on technical analysis  
which is discu ssed in  more det ail in the Appen dix.  Technical analysis  has many 
different indicators from a simple mov ing average t o a complex  oscillat or.  It is not 
necessary to have an i n-depth understandi ng of technical analysis  to be a successful 
swing trader, however, it is helpful to have a rudi mentary understandi ng of how we 
approach swing trading pattern recognition. 
5.1 Technical Analysis Measures used to Recognize 
Swing Trading Patterns 
To begin with, we typi cally restrict our selections to stocks that are at least $12 in 
price, having an average (20 day) daily volume of at least 500,000 shares.  Since 
market makers can  more easily  manipulate low price,  low volume st ocks, we stay 
away from them. 
For long swings  we are i nterested i n identifying stocks that are i n an uptrend.  One 
of the i ndicators we use i s a simple moving average (SMA).  A movi ng average i s 
simply the average closing price for a partic ular number of days.  It’s cal led a moving 
average because on each new day, the curre nt day’s price is added to the average 
while the oldest price is dropped.  We typically focus on three moving averages, 
those based on 10 days, 20 days and 50 days.  All moving averages smooth the 
price movement and make it easier to identify  trends.  It is also sign ificant to know 
where today’s pri ce is relative to the movi ng averages and whether the shorter time-
frame moving average is above or below th e longer time-frame moving average.  
Two indicators that a stock is in an uptrend are: 
 Visit:  http://www.mrswing.com/      or      emai l: larry@mrswi ng.com A Pract ical Gu ide to Swin g Trading by Larry Swi ng 
• Today’s closing price is above both the 10-day and 20-day moving averages 
• The 10-day moving average is above the 20-day moving average 
When looking for a long swing , we woul d like to identify stocks that are 
experien cing a brief  declin e (pullback ).  We can  identify a 3-day pullback  as follows. 
• Today’s high price is lowe r than yesterday’s high 
• Yesterday’s high is lower th an the high the day before 
We also use a technical indicator deve loped by Dr. Alexander Elder called the Force 
Index .  This index combin es the magn itude of the pri ce change wi th the di rection of 
the change and the trading volume.  In orde r to confi rm the rel ative force behi nd an 
uptrend and a pullback, we use a 3-da y moving average and a 13-day moving 
average of the Force Index.  The following  condi tions demonstrate that the bears 
have been wi nning the short-term battl e while bu lls are domin ating the longer 
frame: 
• The 3-day moving average of the Force In dex is less t han 0, and 
• The 13-day moving average of the Force Index is greater than 0 
Another technical in dicator we like to use is the Directional Movement Index (DMI) 
that was dev eloped by  J. Welles Wilder J r.  It is used to determine whether a st ock is 
trendi ng or not trendi ng (i.e., movi ng sideways).  In SwingTracker we provide the 
two components of thi s indicator – the Positive Directional Index (+DI) and the 
Negati ve Directional Index (-DI) – al ong with a 20-day moving average based on 
these two measures (ADX).  An uptrend is confirmed if … 
• ADX is higher than 30 
• +DI is greater than –DI

charge) at www.mrswi ng.com  in the SwingLab  section of the web site.  You can 
copy the formul as into SwingTracker and scan all listed stocks at any time..  These

6 The Master Plan – Entry and exit rules that 
insure successful swing trading 
s The secret to swing trading success is: 
Confidence, Discipline, Focus and Patience 
6.1 WHAT is the Master Plan 
The Master Plan  is a set of rul es that determi nes wh en to enter and exit a trade.  At 
first, it might seem a l ittle compl icated, but once you have pl ace a few trades usi ng 
the system, you’ll realiz e it’s really  quite simple.   The best  part abou t the Master 
Plan is that you don’t need to use judgm ent.  The rules are mechanical.  Two 
obstacles to successful trading are the hum an emoti ons of fear and greed.  By 
following the Master Plan, these emot ions will not influence your behavior, nor will 
they interfere with your success. 
To keep i t simple, we’l l first focus on the long trade.  The rules for a short trade are 
simply the mirror image of the rules fo r a long trade.  An example of a long swing  
opport unity is sh own below .  The price h as declin ed (pulled back ) and you are bu llish 
on the stock.

6.2 Taking a Profit and Preserving Capital 
An important aspect of the Master Plan  is setting a profit target and preserving 
capital.  The approach  is fairly conservative – the prof it target is approx imately 7% 
with a pot ential loss capped at  4%.  The actual prof it is likely to be more t han 7% 
while a loss is lik ely to be smaller t han 4%.  Here’ s how it works.  
• Once the target price is reached (7% above the entry price), half of the 
shares are sold,  locking in a 7%  profit.  The other shares remain  invested to 
benefi t from any further i ncrease i n price. 
• If the pri ce moves agai nst the trade, the maxi mum l oss tol erated i s 4%.  Thi s 
preserves capi tal for future trades. 
• Typically , more t rades w ill produ ce a prof it than a loss.   The net result is 
profit. 
• The movement of the entire market is very powerful.  When the market is 
moving with your trades,  a very high percen tage of your trades w ill be 
profitable. 
• When the entire market is moving agains t your trade, a higher than expected 
percen tage of your trades w ill lose.   The stop loss  protects you from 
excessive losses. 
6.2.1 Profit is taken using a “sell limit” order – once the 
price is reached, the specified number of shares 
are sold. 
6.2.2 Capital is protected using a “stop loss” order – 
when the stop price is reached, all the shares are 
sold.

s  Buying AFTE R the open is BE TTER 
 Wait a few moments to allow the market to 
breath normally   
6.3 When to Enter the Trade  
Using the Master Plan , swing trading opportunities ar e identified after the market 
closes.  Trades are entered in the morning,  usual ly within the fi rst hal f hour of 
trading.  When you enter the trade (and the decision rule you use) depends on 
whether or not the stock has gapped up or  down from the previous day’s closing 
price.   Accordin g to the Master Plan , a stock is considered to have gapped up when 
it opens 50 cents or more higher than the pr evious day’s close;  it is con sidered t o 
have gapped down when it opens 50 cents lower than the previous day’s close.  
Most frequently , the stock price w ill open  within 50 cents of the previous day’s 
close, nei ther gappi ng up nor gappi ng down. 
• The most common occurrence – the stoc k opens within 50 cents ($0.50) of 
the previous day’s close – the order ca n be placed a few minutes after the 
market opens. 
• Occasionally a stock gaps up 50 cents or more compared to the previous 
day’s close – the order is placed at le ast 30 minutes after the market opens. 
• Occasionally a stock gaps down 50 cent s or more compared to the previous 
day’s close – the order is placed appr oximately 5 minutes after the market 
opens. 
• To summarize, if the stock gaps in the same direction  as the trade, wai t 30 
minutes , and if the stock gaps in the opposite direction  of the trade, wai t 
5 minutes . 
6.4 How to Enter the Trade  
As with when to trade , how to enter depends on whether the stock gaps up/down 
or not.  Typically, the stock price doesn’ t gap up or down and the entry price is 
based on the previous day’s prices.  When the stock gaps up or down, the entry price 
is not based on the previous day’s prices, but on the current day’s prices.  Whether 
 Visit:  http://www.mrswing.com/      or      emai l: larry@mrswi ng.com A Pract ical Gu ide to Swin g Trading by Larry Swi ng 
based on the previous day’s prices or the current day’s prices, the entry rules are the 
same. 
• The most common occurrence – the stock opens within 50 cents 
($0.50) of the previous day’s close  – buy the stock the moment i t trades 
6 cents  (1/16) above the previous day’s high.  This can be accomplished by 
using a buy stop order.   This increases t he likelihood that the price is mov ing 
in the direct ion of the bullish (long) trade. 
• Occasionally a stock gaps up or down 50 cents or more  – buy the stock 
the moment it trades 6 cents  above the high of the new day .  This would be 
30 minutes after the market opens for a gap up or 5 minutes after the 
market opens for a gap down . 
6.5 What to do After the Trade is Executed 
Once the trade is executed, the exit orders are placed. 
• The profit order – a sell limit  order is placed at a price that is 7% above the 
entry price. 
• The capital preservation order – a sell stop (stop limit)  order is placed at 
4% below the entry price OR 6 cents below  the low of the day that was 
used for the trade (whichever is higher ) – for a stock that opened without a 
gap the previous day sets the prices; fo r a stock that opened with a gap, the 
price action before the day (high and low) sets the prices.

6.6 What to do the Day After the Trade is Executed 
As with when to trade and how to enter , the fol lowing day’s acti vity  depends on 
whether the stock gaps up/down or not.  If the stock price doesn’t gap up or down, 
the stop loss  is changed based on the previous day’s prices.  If the stock gaps up or 
down, the stop loss is changed based on the current day’s prices.  Whether based 
on the previous day’s prices or the current day’s prices, stop loss ru le is t he same.  
• When the stock opens within 50 cents ($0.50) of the previous day’s 
close  – if 6 cents  below the previous day’s low is higher than yesterday’s 
stop loss , raise the stop loss to thi s new pri ce.   This is k nown as raisin g the 
trailing stop , which further limit s the dow nside risk . 
• When the stock gaps up or down 50 cents or more  – wait 30 minutes  
for a gap down  or 5 minutes  for a gap up  – if 6 cents  below the today’s 
low is higher than yesterday ’s stop loss , raise the stop loss  to thi s new 
price. 
6.7 What happens if the Trade is Not Executed 
Let’s say that you are receiving recommendations from MasterSwings  or MrSwing 
Lite and your trade is not executed on the day the order is placed.  You can repeat 
the process for up to 5 tradi ng days. 
• If the stock gaps up or down, wait the appropriate amount of time (30 
minutes for a gap up and 5 mi nutes fo r a gap down) – determine the entry 
and exit prices based on the current day’s prices. 
• If the stock opens within 50 cents of yesterday’s close, the entry and exit 
prices are based on the previous day’s prices.

6.8 Once half the shares close at a 7% profit, the 
other half remains open to “ride the wave”.  
When do we close the second half of the trade? 
A trailing stop  is used to close the 2nd half of the trade.  Remember that a trailing 
stop is used to raise the sell stop  (stop loss) during the trade.  The same rules 
apply (see 6 .6 above).  The shares are sold when the price drops to 6 cents below 
the low of previous day (no gap on open ) or the current day (gap on open). 
6.9 The Short Swing – how we make money when we 
think the price of the stock is going down 
A short swing is used to make money when a stock’s price is predicted to go down.  
We sell short the stock.  For those u nfamiliar w ith shorting stocks, we sell the 
stock wi thout havi ng previ ously owned i t.  Additional detai l about shorti ng stocks can 
be found the Appendi x.  For now, i t is only necessary to know that our goal  is to sel l 
the stock and buy it back at a lower price. 
While anyone can sell short, you must make  sure that your brokerage account is 
approved for trading on margin .   If you do not have a margin account , simply  fill 
out the necessary forms with your current brokerage fi rm or open an account wi th 
one of the firms recommended for swing trading. 
A short swing  is a mirror image of a long swing .  The price of a stock in a 
downtrend tends to have periodic,  short-term rallies ( pull-ups) as the price mov es 
lower.  The set up for a short swing  is the brief  rally (or pull-up).  The decision  
rules in  the Master Plan help enter the trade when th e stock is resuming it’s 
downward path. 
A chart showi ng a downtrend that i s conduci ve to short swing trading  is shown on 
the next page.

Notice in the chart below  that the dow ntrend is in terrupted by  short-term rallies 
(pull-ups).  The trade is placed af ter a sh ort-term rally  (or pull-up), once the stock 
resumes its downtrend. 
The trade is entered on a day when the pric e falls below  the low  of the prev ious day. 
The rules for entering and exiting a short swing  are shown schematically on the 
next page. 
While the rules might seem somewhat co mplicated, several brokerage firms make 
the process quite easy.  Interactive Brokers  – described in the next section – 
allows you to enter the three components of  the trade al l at the same ti me.  For a 
short swing  they are: 
• A sell stop  to sell the stock when the price moves below the stop price  
• A buy stop  to buy back the shares if the price moves up 4% 
• A buy limit  to lock in profits (on ½ the shares) when the price drops 7% 
The schematic diagram prov ides in structions for how to adjust these prices on the 
second day, third day, and so on, based on whether the stock has been sold short  
or not.  The schematic prov ides ex it instructions as w ell.

8 The Essentials of Technical Analysis 
8.1 Intro 
We humans have a very hard ti me maki ng fast decisions with complicated info. That 
is why, as human traders, we try to si mplify trading as much as possible, in order to 
scan fast & accurate trading opportunities in  a few seconds. As Al bert Ei nstein used 
to say: keep thi ngs as si mple as possible nut not any simpler! 
The following Technical An alysis (TA) tools are part  of the daily  charting arsen al: 
 Candle stick 
 Volume 
 Equivolume 
 MA (???) 
 Force Index 
 DMI 
 Up/Down/In/Out 
 ... 
8.2 Why does Technical Analysis work? 
Simply because the l arge professi onal traders cannot hel p leaving behi nd 
considerable ev idence regardin g their opin ion on the direct ion of the mark et: volume 
provides clues as to the i ntensity of a gi ven pri ce move... 
The key i s psychol ogy: you trade peopl e, not stocks. Peopl e never change...most 
traders keep on maki ng the same mi stakes agai n and agai n...luckily for us. Read thi s 
again and think about it! 
8.3 The Basics  
A stock price is det ermined by  an exchange between buyers and sellers. If there 
happens to be more buyers than sellers then  the market goes up. On the contrary, if 
there happens to be more sellers than buye rs then the market goes down. Logical! 
 Visit:  http://www.mrswing.com/      or      emai l: larry@mrswi ng.com A Pract ical Gu ide to Swin g Trading by Larry Swi ng 
The pri ce at whi ch a stock i s offered affects the trader's deci sion. If a trader i s long 
and the stock starts to decl ine, the trader coul d be forced to cl ose hi s posi tion. If 
short, he mi ght do l ikewise on a rising stock. 
 
When a trader t akes a lon g posit ion, he becomes a pot ential seller,  while sh ort 
positions are h eld by potential bu yers. As prices ch ange du e to buying and sellin g 
pressu re, information abou t the con dition of the stock is rev ealed by  the combin ation 
of price and volume action. 
8.4 Japanese Candle sticks  
In the 1600s, the Japanese developed a method  of technical analysis to analyze the 
price of rice contracts. This technique is called candlestick charting. Steven Nison is 
credit ed with popu larizing candlestick charting and is n ow recogn ized as t he leadin g 
expert on their interpretation.  
Candlestick charts display  the open , high, low, and closin g prices in  a format similar 
to a modern-day bar-chart, but in a manner that extenuates the rel ationshi p 
between the open ing and closin g prices.  Candlestick charts are simply  a new way of 
looking at price;  they don't involve any calcu lations.

Figure 4: a closed candle stick chart  
8.5 Volume  
Volume is simply  the number of  shares t raded duri ng a gi ven ti meframe (e.g., hour, 
day, week, month, etc.). The analysis of  volume is a basi c yet very i mportant 
compon ent of technical an alysis. Volume prov ides clu es as t o the intensity of a giv en 
price move. 
High volume lev els are ch aracteristic of market tops when there is a strong 
consensus that prices w ill mov e higher. High volume lev els are also v ery common  at 
the begi nning of new trends (i.e., when pri ces break out of a tradi ng range). Al so, 
just before mark et bottoms, volume w ill often increase du e to panic-driven sellin g.  
Volume can  help det ermine the strength of an exi sting trend. A strong up-trend 
should have higher volume on  the upward legs of  the trend, and lower volume on the 
downward (correct ive) legs.  Similarly , strong downtrends usually have higher volume 
on the downward legs of the trend and lo wer volume on the upward (corrective) 
legs.  
8.6 Equivolume 
Equivolume display s prices in  a man ner that emph asizes the relat ionship bet ween 
price an d volume. Equivolume w as dev eloped by Richard W. Arms, Jr., and is 
explained in greater detail in his book “Volume C ycles in the Stock Market”  
Instead of di splaying vol ume as an "after thought" on the l ower margi n of a chart, 
Equivolume combin es price an d volume in  a two-dimen sional box. The top line of the 
box is the high for the period and the botto m line is the low for the period. The width 
of the box is the unique feature of E quivolume - it represents the volume for the 
period.

Figure 5: Equivolume 
The shape of each E quivolume box provides  a picture of the supply and demand for 
the security during a specific trading pe riod. Short and wi de boxes (heavy vol ume 
accompan ied w ith small ch anges in  price)  tend to occur at turning poin ts, while tall 
and narrow boxes (light volume accompan ied w ith large ch anges in  price)  are more 
likely to occur in established trends.  
Especially important are boxes that penetr ate support or resistance levels, since 
volume con firms pen etrations  
A "power box " is on e in which both height and width increase su bstantially. Power 
boxes prov ide ex cellen t confirmat ion of a breakout. A narrow box, due to light 
volume, casts dou bt on the validity of a break out in question.  
We alw ays look at volume in  relation with price mov ement: 
q 
Volume  Trend Reversal 
 Above-Average Volume with LITTLE price movement 
 Above-Average Volume after a huge advance or decline  
Trend Continuation 
 Above-Average Volume with STRONG price movement 
 Above-Average Volume with breakout 
 Below-Average Volume with NO price movement

8.7 Moving Averages 
A Moving Average (MA) is an indicator that  shows the average value of a security's 
price over a period of time. When calcul ating a moving average, a mathematical 
analysis of the security's average value over a predetermined time period is made. 
As the security's price changes, it s average price moves up or down. 
Simple MA = (P1 + P2 + ... + Pn) / n 
where P is the pri ce being averaged and n is the number of days i n the MA  
There are five popular types of moving averages: simple (also referred to as 
arithmetic), exponential, triangular, variable, and wei ghted. Movi ng averages can be 
calculated on any data series including a se curity's open, hi gh, low, close, vol ume, or 
another indicator. I use only the 10- 20 & 50 day  simple M A on closin g prices.

8.8 Force Index 
Force In dex is an  oscillat or developed by  Dr. Alexander Elder in  his excellen t book : 
“Trading for a Living”. 
Force Index combines the three most esse ntial pieces of  mark et information: 
 the direction of price change 
 its extent  
 its trading volume. 
It provides a n ew, pract ical way of using volume to make trading decision s. 
Force Index Force Index = Volume(today) * (C lose(today) - Close(yesterday))  
Although Force Index can be used raw, I prefer to smooth them with moving 
average: 
Larry’s Index FI-3days MA & FI-13days MA

A 3-day MA of Force Index i s a very sens itive indicator which shows the short-term 
battle between the bul ls and th e bears. And the 13-day MA of Force Index identifies 
the longer-term battle be tween bulls and bears. 
Force Index  BUY opportunity : 
 FI-13MA => 0 
 FI-3MA <= 0 
 UPTREND  
SELL opportuni ty: 
 FI-13MA =<0 
 FI-3MA >= 0 
 DOWNTREND

8.9 Directional Moving Index  
The Di rectional Movement Index (DMI) i s a trend-following indicator developed by J. 
Welles Wilder,  Jr., design ed to determine whether a secu rity is in a trending or non-
trending market. Since the market is in a strong trend onl y about 30% of the ti me 
and in sideways about 70% of the ti me, thi s indicator i s used to capture the peri od 
when the market shows significant tr ending or directional behavior.  
The calcu lation of the DMI is fairly complex  and con sists of three lin es:  
DMI +DI: current positive directional in dex, the range of highs divided 
by the price range over the last day and previous close, smoothed 
over a given number of periods. 
-DI: current negati ve directional index, the range of lows divided 
by the price range over the last day and previous close, smoothed 
over a given number of periods. 
ADX: modified moving average of the difference of +DI and -DI 
divided by the sum of +DI and -DI, multiplied by 100. 
UpTrend: 
 ADX > 30 the hi gher the better 
 +DI > -DI 
DownTrend: 
 ADX > 30 the hi gher the better 
 -DI > +DI  
8.10  Up/Down/In/Out   
Up/Down/In/Out is a ch art overlay available on  SwingTracker (software I recen tly 
developed) that color-code s individual bars or cand lesticks based on price 
movement. It rel ates the current hi gh and low price with the previous high and low 
price. 
Up (Green) indicates the current high is higher than the previous high and the 
current low is higher than the prev ious low.

current low is low er than the prev ious low. 
In (Yellow) indicates the current high is low er than the prev ious high, and the 
current low is higher than previous low.

10 FREE SwingLab 
SwingLab works alon gside w ith SwingTracker, my real- time ch arting software. One 
of the best features of Swi ngTracker i s the "Scan" feature, whi ch lets you bui ld your 
own stock screens to find the specific  stocks you'd like to swing trade. 
 
I will 
show 
you 
some of 
the 
formulas I use, and how I use them. There is also a step-by-step description of how 
to set the screens up. q  Why does swing trading work? 
Because you are trading in the direction of the trend.  You 
wait for a pul lback before enteri ng the trade, and you enter 
only if the stock shows a sign  that it’s price w ill con tinue in 
the di rection of the trend. 
On www.mrswi ng.com , you will find regular update in the SwingLab sect ion of the 
site. Let's get started.  
10.1 Starting with SwingLab  
Swing traders seek pivot points in stocks - gaps, breakouts and reversals - with a 1 
to 5-day ti me hori zon. Here are some of th e scans that I use... i f you fi nd one that

12 Appendix A–Short Selling 
Traditionally the premise of  investing is that you buy an asset  and hold it until it rises 
enough to make a sizable profit, it doesn' t get much easi er than that. What about 
the times you come across a stock that you wo uldn't invest a cent i n, you know that 
thing is doomed,  a sure loser.  If you knew that the stock was goin g to declin e 
wouldn't be nice to be able t o profit from its declin e.  
Well y ou can profit from the declin e of a stock and although it sounds easy, there are 
substantial risk s and pitfalls that you need to watch out for. The mechani cs of a short 
sale are somewhat complicated and the invest or's risks are high so it is important 
that you understand the transacti on befo re getti ng into it. Let’s di ve in! 
12.1.1 What does it mean to sell short?  
If you sell a st ock you don't own, you are sellin g short. (Yes, it's legal. ) You are n ow 
short the stock. 
A short seller sells a st ock that he believ es will fall in value. A short seller does n ot 
own the stock before he sells it. Instead,  he borrows i t from someone who al ready 
owns i t. Later, the short sel ler buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock 
to close out the l oan. If the stock has fal len in price since he sold short, he can buy 
the stock back  for less t han he receiv ed for sellin g it. The difference is h is prof it. 
Short sellin g allow s investors to profit from falling stock prices.  "Buy low, sell h igh" is 
the goal of  both short sellin g and purchasing shares ( "going long"). A short sale 
reverses the order of a typical stock purc hase: the stock is sold first and bought 
later. 
For example, in September 1987, Bob thinks  IBM is overvalued. She sells short 100 
shares of IBM at $175 per share. The stoc k market crashes in October and IBM's 
shares fall to $125 per share. Bob buys ba ck 100 shares of IBM and closes out the 
short sale. Bob gains the difference betw een the sales proceeds and the purchase 
costs and pockets $5,000 from the short sale, excluding transaction costs. 
12.1.2 Where Does The Broker Get The Stock? 
The short answer is from other customers.  Oddly enough, he doesn't have to ask 
permission!

Short selling is a marginable ( ???) transaction. In plain E nglish, that means you must 
open a margin account to sell short. This is the same account you woul d use i f you 
want to use your stocks as col lateral to borrow money from your broker.  
When you open a margi n account, you must si gn a hypothecati on / rehypothecati on 
agreemen t. This hypothecation agreemen t says you will pledge y our stocks as 
collat eral again st your loan. The re-hypothecation agreemen t allow s your broker to 
loan your stocks to a bank, or to other customers!  
12.1.3 How Do I Sell Short? 
Unlike a st ock purchase transaction, which involves two part ies (the buyer and the 
seller) , short sellin g involves three part ies: the origin al ow ner, the short seller,  and 
the new buyer. The short seller borrows shares from the original owner, and 
immediat ely sells t hem on  the open  mark et to any willing buyer. To finalize ("close 
out") the short sal e transacti on, the shor t seller must then go out i nto the stock 
market and buy the same amount of shares as  he sold so that the broker can return 
them to the ori ginal owner. 
To sell short you first must set up a marg in account wi th your broker. A margi n 
account al lows you borrow fr om your brokerage company using the value of your 
portfolio as collat eral. The gen eral ru le is t hat the value of your portfolio mu st equal 
at least 50% of the si ze of the short sal e transacti on. In other words, If you have 
$1,000 worth of stock in your margin account, you can borrow $2,000 of stock to sell 
short. 
To sell a stock short, you must borrow stock.  To initiate a short sale,  you simply  call 
up your broker and ask to sell short a spec ific number of shares of your selected 
stock. Your broker then checks with th e Margin Department to see whether the 
shares are available or can be borrowed fr om another brokerage, usual ly while you 
wait on the phone for a minute. If they are available, the brokerage borrows the 
shares, sells them in the open market, and puts the proceeds into your margin 
account. To close out your sh ort sale,  you tell your broker that you want to buy the 
same n umber of  shares t hat you shorted. The brok er will purchase the shares f or 
you usi ng the money i n your margi n account, return the shares and cl ose out the 
short sale transaction. 
While your short sale is ou tstanding, your accou nt will be ch arged in terest again st 
the val ue of the short posi tion. If the stock you shorted goes up in price, or the value 
 Visit:  http://www.mrswing.com/      or      emai l: larry@mrswi ng.com A Pract ical Gu ide to Swin g Trading by Larry Swi ng 
of the stock you are u sing as collat eral goes dow n in price,  so that your collat eral is 
less than the "maintenance" requirement (u sually 30%  of the value of the short 
position) you will be requ ired t o add mon ey to your margin  accou nt or bu y back  the 
stock that you sold short. You must also  pay any dividends issued by the company 
whose stock you sold short. 
12.1.4 Up Tick Rule 
To sell your stock short, you must adhere to the up-ti ck rule. The transacti on before 
your short sale must have been executed  at a higher price than the transaction 
before i t. In other words, the transacti on befo re your short sal e must be an up-ti ck.  
In pract ice, you cannot short a stock that is already  falling in price.  Otherwise, short 
selling would amplif y the declin e.  
12.1.5 Why Sell Short? 
The two primary  reason s for sellin g short are opport unism an d port folio prot ection. 
Occasionally investors see a st ock that they bel ieve has b een hyped to a ridiculously 
high level. They believ e that the stock price w ill fall when realit y replaces t he hype. A 
short sal e provi des the opportuni ty to prof it from the overpriced stock. Short sales 
are also used to protect an investor's portfolio against a market downturn. By 
shorting stocks that the investor believ es will fall sharply when the mark et as a 
whole falls, investors can  help insulate the value of their port folios again st sudden 
market drops. 
Zitel provides an example of opportunistic short selling. In 1996, Zitel was caught up 
in a wave of investor enthusiasm becau se it has a stake in a company that fixes the 
computer glitch that causes computers to interpret dates in the next century (2000s) 
as dates in this century (1900s). This pr oblem, known as the "Year 2000" problem, 
suddenly became a hot topic of  conversati on and made i t to the covers of Ti me and 
Newsweek. In September 1996, Zitel was se lling for $7 per share. By December, the 
shares topped $70. At this point, many in vestors thought the stock was overpriced 
and saw  an opport unity to make money by sellin g it short. If an investor had sold 
short in December 1996, he could have bought the stock back for $15 per share in 
April 1997. Selling short would have allowed the investor to take very profitable 
advantage of the opportunity presente d by the overpriced Zitel stock.

Short sellin g is also u sed to protect portfolios again st erosion  due to a broad mark et 
declin e. Short sellers mak e money when stock prices f all. An investor can  diversify a 
long portfolio by  addin g some sh ort posit ions. The port folio will then have posit ions 
that make money both when pri ces rise and when they fal l. This reduces the 
volatility in the port folio's returns and helps prot ect the value of the port folio when 
prices are f alling. 
By shorting caref ully select ed stocks that are priced n ear their peak  but that will fall 
sharply if the mark et falls, an investor can use the profits from the short sales to 
help offset losses in  his long posit ion to protect the value of his port folio. 
For exampl e, Bob has most of hi s weal th tied up i n stocks whi ch she has bought 
because she expects them to appreciate in price. But she is concerned that the stock 
market is vulnerable to a sharp drop and wants to protect his savings while staying 
invested in the market. She knows that market drops are often caused by a change 
of investor sentiment from optimism to pessimism. She id entifies businesses that are 
not worth much today, but whose stock pri ce is high because peopl e hold high hopes 
for their future prospects. These stocks shou ld be especially  suscept ible to a negative 
shift in sentiment since optimism is w hat principally  drives their stock price.  She then 
sells these stocks short. If investors beco me more pessimistic and the market falls 
these stocks shoul d fall more than most. Larry can use the profits from these short 
sales t o offset losses in  the rest  of his port folio. This will help to protect the value of 
his port folio.

UkrainexiWith growth in Europe and Central Asia having peaked at 2.7 percent in 2017, policy mak-
ers face new challenges. How can they navigate the expected cyclical downturn? How can 
they boost underlying potential growth that has slowed, especially since the global finan-
cial crisis? How should they adjust regulations and reform policies to benefit from the digi-
tal revolution while mitigating the transition costs? This report summarizes the economic 
outlook for the region and examines the adoption of new blockchain technologies. In doing 
so, it touches on all three challenges. 
The 2017 rates of growth of GDP (2.7 percent) and private consumption (2.5 percent) 
were faster than at any time since the global financial crisis of a decade ago. Growth was 
especially strong in Central Europe and in Turkey, but it was robust in other parts of the 
region as well. Unemployment rates are now close to their 2007 levels in most countries, 
and average inflation exceeds 2 percent, indicating that little spare capacity is left. 
Deceleration of growth is expected to be modest, but a sharper correction remains pos-
sible. Cyclical forces can easily reinforce one another, and additional shocks—rising pro-
tectionism, geopolitical tensions, larger than expected disruptions caused by Brexit—could 
materialize. There is little room for further monetary stimulus if the expected slowdown is 
sharper than expected. The region has rebuilt some fiscal buffers, however. The average 
fiscal deficit in 2017 is estimated at just above 1 percent of GDP , down from 6 percent dur -
ing the 2009 crisis and close to levels at the end of the boom that preceded that crisis. Fiscal 
stimulus is thus an option in several countries in case of a sharper than expected slow-
down. Under the baseline scenario of only a modest deceleration, however, a further 
buildup of fiscal buffers seems the best strategy. 
Many countries in the region have proven to be fertile ground for the development of 
cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. The emergence of these technologies is part 
of a broader wave of technologies that facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) commerce, the indi-
vidualization of products, and the flexibilization of production methods. 
For a variety of reasons, these trends gained traction after the global financial crisis a 
decade ago. Blockchain technologies aim to organize P2P transactions and P2P informa-
tion flows without intermediaries and central banks have opportunities to use blockchain 
technologies to improve their services. 
It is unclear how these technologies will develop in the long run; their ultimate impact 
may be very different from the current applications. In response, policy makers should 
strike a balance between curbing the hype surrounding these new technologies and un-
leashing potentially transformational new opportunities. While encouraging and facilitat-
ing these innovations, they should prepare to craft new regulations to create a level playing 
field for new and old industries, by adjusting financial oversight, consumer protection, 
and tax administration. They should also address the massive volume of electricity used 
to mine cryptocurrencies. Executive SummaryPART
Economic OutlookI3

3Overview
Growth is strong in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), stronger than at any time 
since the global financial crisis of a decade ago. GDP rose 2.7 percent, and annual 
private consumption rose 2.5 percent. Growth was especially strong in Central 
Europe and Turkey, but it was robust in other parts of the region as well. 
Growth has likely peaked, however. Increased capacity utilization, unemploy-
ment rates close to their 2007 levels, and average inflation now exceeding 2 per -
cent are all signals that growth is likely to decelerate. 
The peaking of growth raises several questions
• How well is the region prepared for a sharper than expected cyclical down-
turn? As fiscal deficits have fallen to an average 1.5 percent of GDP , fiscal 
policy could be used. But in most countries, monetary tightening would prob-
ably be more appropriate. 
• Why is the underlying structural growth so low? Growth in 2017 was 0.4 per -
centage points below the average growth rate between 2000 and 2007. The 
decelerating growth trend is associated with the shift toward services, the de-
cline in capital deepening, and a slower pace of measured total factor produc-
tivity (TFP). 
• Has the economic upswing been used to adjust to the new normal of digital 
technologies, more flexible employment contracts, and increased tradability 
of goods and services? An unfinished agenda remains in terms of rethinking 
social protection and facilitating private sector development in new, interna-
tionally competitive sectors. It is important that adjustments toward this new 
reality continue, even if the expected slowdown materializes or deepens. Economic Developments  
and Prospects4 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
Growth is strong throughout the region 
GDP growth of 2.7 percent in 2017 translated into a robust 2.5 percent increase in 
per capita GDP , as the population is growing at a mere 0.2 percent a year. This 
rate of growth was the fastest since 2007 and 0.9 percentage points faster than in 
2016 (table 1.1). Growth exceeded 4 percent in 20 of the 47 countries in the region. 
Ireland and Malta enjoyed growth of more than 5 percent. Romania and Slovenia 
in Central Europe; Armenia and Georgia in the South Caucasus; and Turkey, Ta-
jikistan, and Uzbekistan in Central Asia also reported strong growth. Azerbaijan, 
Belarus, and the Russian Federation emerged from recession (although their 
growth was only moderate). Not a single country in the region experienced a 
contraction in 2017.
Private sector demand drove this vigorous performance. Government con -
sumption increased by less than 1 percent on average in the region. Private in-
vestment rose by more than 4 percent, and growth in investment outpaced GDP 
growth for the fourth year in a row. The volume of exports and imports expanded 
by more than 5 percent in 2017, roughly twice as fast as GDP growth.1 
The acceleration of growth has been a global phenomenon. Since the summer 
of 2016, growth of global industrial production has more than doubled, ap-
proaching 5 percent in recent months, very close to the 4.8 percent global growth 
during the 2003–07 boom.

The ECA region closely followed that acceleration (figure 1.1). The region as a 
whole outperformed the United States in 2017, and growth of industrial produc-
tion in Central Europe and Turkey was on par with growth in China and India. 
This performance lies in sharp contrast to performance in the aftermath of the 
European banking and debt crisis, when the region’s performance significantly 
lagged that of the world as a whole. 
During this global acceleration, commodity prices rebounded. Copper prices, 
which are closely linked to the industrial cycle, increased 43 percent between 
October 2016 and March 2018, more than any other commodity. Oil prices in-
creased 30 percent over the same period (figure 1.2, panel a), providing some 
relief for energy exporters and recipients of remittances in the eastern part of the 
region. Consistent with their strong relationship with energy prices, grain prices 
increased 18 percent between October 2016 and March 2018. Other agricultural 
prices declined, leaving the index of agricultural prices flat. 
The total nonoil commodity price index increased 10 percent over the last year 
and a half, largely reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar over that period, as 
all commodity prices are measured in dollars. The dollar depreciated 11 percent 
against the euro and 6 percent against the Chinese renminbi over this period. 
Average commodity prices expressed in these two currencies were thus relatively 
stable. The dollar also depreciated against other currencies in the region. Between 
October 2016 and March 2018, it fell 16 percent against the Czech koruna, 14 
percent against the Albanian lek and the Polish zloty, 9 percent against the Rus-
sian ruble and the Hungarian forint, 7 percent against the Romanian leu, and 3 
percent against the Kazakh tenge. Only a few regional currencies depreciated 
during this period against the dollar. The Turkish lira depreciated 27 percent, and 
the Azeri manat depreciated 5 percent. Metal and oil prices increased in all cur -
rencies, and many other commodity prices declined in euros or other currencies 
in the region. 
Despite their cyclical upturn, oil prices are nowhere near their historical highs. 
Indeed, adjusted for inflation, global oil prices are 57 percent below their peak of /endash.case3/endash.case2/endash.case10123456

July 2008 and 43 percent below the average level between early 2011 and late 2014 
(figure 1.2, panel b).2 There are no signs that oil markets will return to those re-
cord prices. Consequently, adjustments in countries that directly or indirectly 
depend on oil exports should continue. 
Several of these countries have become more competitive in international 
markets and begun diversifying their economies, partly as a result of the depre-
ciation of real exchange rates since the fall in oil prices late 2014. Unexploited 
opportunities remain to shift farther away from nontradable production. Domes -
tic reforms that correct price distortions, eliminate privileges for state-sponsored 
companies, and unleash more competition and innovation remain essential. The 
recent wave of reforms in Uzbekistan sets a good example.3 They will likely lead 
to further diversification and may trigger reforms in surrounding countries.FIGURE 1.2  Commodity

Growth appears to have peaked
Signals are mounting that global growth has peaked. With less spare capacity, 
lower unemployment, rising inflation, and tightening monetary policy, the po -
tential for continued rapid growth has diminished, especially in the ECA region. 
Unemployment is now close to where it was at the height of the boom a de-
cade ago (figure 1.3, panel a). The labor market has become tight, especially in 
Northern Europe. The rapid decline in unemployment is remarkable, given the 
history of hysteresis in the region’s labor markets. After every major crisis, the 
typical pattern in Europe was for unemployment rates to settle at higher levels. 
It is especially encouraging that youth unemployment in the European Union 
has fallen sharply. It is now back to 2005 levels (figure 1.3, panel b), having fallen

from 24.0 in 2013 percent to 16.8 percent in 2017 (the overall unemployment rate 
fell from 9.5 percent to 6.7 percent over this period).4 
Average inflation in the western part of the region has been almost 2 percent 
since early 2017 (figure 1.4). That is a critical change from the deflationary threats 
in the aftermath of the European banking crises. Between 2012 and 2016, the 
consumer price index declined in at last one year in Armenia, Bosnia and Herze-
govina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Greece, Ireland, It-
aly, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, 
Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. In several of these countries, the GDP deflator 
still rose, and the drop in consumer prices reflected terms-of-trade gains. Never -
theless, the deflationary threat was a serious concern and the manifestation of 
underutilized resources. 
None of these countries experienced deflation in 2017. The average inflation 
rate of 2 percent is close to the target of monetary authorities. As a result, the Euro-
pean Central Bank will likely discontinue quantitative easing in 2018; central banks 
outside the euro area are also expected to tighten their policies. Tightening has 
already started in Turkey, where inflation has reached double-digit levels. 
Asset prices have risen even faster than consumer prices (figure 1.5). The in-
crease in real estate prices is not nearly as extreme as it was during the boom a 
decade ago, but in Northern Europe double-digit annual increases were not un-
common in 2017. This boom is an additional reason for monetary policy makers 
to raise interest rates.
In the eastern part of the region, monetary policies are likely to tighten in com -
ing years, even as inflation has recently fallen (figure 1.4). High inflation in 2015 
and 2016 was part of a one-time price adjustment after the fall in oil prices and 
the subsequent unavoidable depreciations of exchange rates. That adjustment

has been completed. Further inflation should now be controlled by central banks, 
which have to build their credibility with floating exchange rates. Now that oil 
prices are recovering, tighter monetary policies make sense, as they can allow 
higher prices to be absorbed by appreciating currencies. 
Tighter monetary policy and rising interest rates will restrain domestic growth 
and reduce capital flows to emerging economies. The capital flows that were 
searching for yields in emerging economies when interest rates in high-income 
countries were close to zero will likely decline, moderating growth in countries with 
large external funding needs. In such an environment, a cyclical downturn is more 
likely than further acceleration or even stabilization of growth at current levels. 
That slowdown may already be happening. The Purchasing Managers’ Index, 
which combines various indicators in the manufacturing sector (new orders, 
inventory levels, production, deliveries, employment), has fallen in the re-
gion since the beginning of 2018 (figure 1.6, panel a). The drop from the peak 
reached in the last six months was particularly large in France, Germany, Italy, 
Turkey, and the United Kingdom, even if the index was still above 50, indicat-
ing growth (figure 1.6, panel b). 
The coming cyclical downturn is expected to be modest, mainly because, with 
few exceptions, there are no signs of overheating that require sharp corrections. 
Investment ratios are still at balanced levels, and no steep declines in those ratios 
are expected. Inflation is at normal levels, and monetary tightening can be very 
gradual. GDP growth for the region is expected to fall from 2.7 percent in 2017 to 
2.3 percent in 2018 and 2.1 percent in 2019. 
The expected slowdown is very similar for the eastern and western parts of 
the region. However, there are marked differences between smaller subregions. 
In the eastern part of the region, almost all the slowdown in growth is forecast to 
come from Turkey, with a modest strengthening of growth in oil-exporting coun-
tries. In the western part of the region, the slowdown is expected to be rather 
evenly distributed among members of the European Union, and some accelera-
tion of growth is expected in the Western Balkans. FIGURE 1.5  Housing prices

Although there are good reasons to expect only a modest deceleration of 
growth, a sharper correction is possible. Cyclical forces can easily reinforce one 
another, and additional shocks—including rising protectionism, geopolitical ten-
sions, and larger than expected disruptions from Brexit—could slow growth.
Does the region have the capacity for countercyclical policies? There is no 
room for further monetary stimulus; at most, the expected monetary tightening 
could be delayed slightly. The region has rebuilt some fiscal buffers. The average 
fiscal deficit is estimated to have been just above 1 percent of GDP in 2017, down 
from 6 percent of GDP during the 2009 crisis; it is close to levels at the end of the 
boom that preceded that crisis (figure 1.7). Fiscal stimulus is thus an option in 
several countries in the event of a sharper than expected slowdown. Under the 
baseline scenario of only a modest deceleration, further buildup of fiscal buffers 
seems the best strategy. FIGURE 1.6  The Purchasing

Two additional questions are worth investigating. Did countries in the region 
use the recovery to adjust the structure of their economies, to better equip them 
for future challenges? Why has potential growth been slower since the crisis than 
it was during the boom that preceded it? The rest of this chapter addresses these 
questions. 
The region has shifted toward more exports. . .
The biggest and most important adjustment during the recovery has been the 
shift of production capacity toward exports. Despite the slowdown in global 
trade, the share of exports in GDP is now 10 percentage points higher than it was 
during the 2000s (figure 1.8). This shift is important, because the economic struc-
ture during the 2003–07 boom, when growth in many countries in the region was 
driven largely by expansion of nontradable sectors, was no longer sustainable. 
During that boom, capital inflows, oil revenues, and inflows of remittances re-
sulted in increased domestic spending and a related loss in international com-
petitiveness. In the new normal after the crisis, all three forms of foreign inflows 
are more moderate. The change has created the opportunity to become more 
competitive in international markets while reducing investments in real estate 
and other nontradable sectors. 
Imports have also increased as a share of GDP , albeit by less than exports. The 
overall current account surplus of the region has thus increased, largely because 
the deficits that Central European countries financed with massive capital in-
flows during the boom have disappeared. These inflows came with a sharp de-
cline in investment ratios in those countries. 
This adjustment is similar to the correction in East Asia after the 1998 financial 
crisis (box 1.1). During the 1990s, emerging East Asian economies received large 
capital inflows after they opened up to global markets, just as Central Europe did 
later, during the 2000s. The reversal of capital flows in 1998 had similar effects on 
East Asia as the 2008 crisis did on Central Europe.FIGURE 1. 7  Government

. . . and adapted to technological change
Apart from this macroeconomic adjustment, countries are adapting to the rapid 
change in technologies caused by the digital revolution, which has far-reaching 
consequences for the way production, labor, and commerce are organized. The 
analysis of how countries are adapting is beyond the scope of this chapter. Chap-
ter 2 examines ECA’s involvement in some of these new technologies. 
In both regions, large current account deficits during the boom were financed 
with capital inflows that were reversed during the crisis. Emerging economies in 
East Asia received large capital inflows during the 1990s, after they opened their 
economies to global markets. Central European economies received large flows 
of foreign direct investment and other capital before and during their accession 
to the European Union. Their aggregate current account deficit widened to more 
than 8 percent of GDP in 2007. Heavy borrowing in foreign markets increased the 
vulnerability of both corporate and financial sectors to capital flow reversals 
(Truman 2013). In both cases, the reversal of capital inflows led to a steep and 
immediate decline in investment rates. In East Asia the loss in income was larger, 
so the immediate fall in investment rates was greater. Investments rates bounced 
back subsequently, but they remained below the preceding boom levels. 
A combination of factors caused the decline in labor 
productivity after the crisis
Growth in ECA returned to precrisis levels in 2017. It has not been strong enough 
to compensate for the production losses that have occurred since the crisis, how-
ever (figure 1.9). Moreover, as little spare capacity is left, it is unlikely that these 
losses can be recouped in the coming years. Thus not only actual growth but also 
potential growth has declined since the crisis. FIGURE 1.8  Since the crisis,

Similarities between recoveries in Central Europe after 2009 
and East Asia in the late 1990s
The recovery of economies in Central Europe from 
the 2008–09 global financial crisis was comparable 
to the recovery of East Asia following the 1998 
financial crisis. Both recoveries took about eight 
years. In East Asia, however, the impact of the crisis was much greater. Five years after the crisis began, 
GDP in East Asia was 37 percent below its precri -
sis level. In Central Europe, the corresponding loss 
was 20 percent.

of the slowdown in potential growth can be attributed to slowing labor supply 
growth (World Bank 2018). The changing pace of capital deepening cannot ex-
plain this slowdown in labor productivity, most of which is reflected in total factor 
productivity (TFP), the unexplained factor in production functions (figure 1.10). 
Differences across countries were considerable, and many idiosyncratic events 
occurred. But after the crisis, every country in the region except Ireland experi-
enced a decline in the contribution of TFP to labor productivity growth (figure 
1.11). In most countries, TFP actually fell.

Labor productivity growth can be decomposed into three components: 
• changes in labor productivity within each economic sector (the within-sector 
component)
• changes in labor productivity resulting from the reallocation of labor across 
sectors (the shift component)
• a cross component that represents the interaction between the change in labor 
productivity within a given sector and the change in labor input share of that 
sector.5 
As the third component is numerically insignificant, analysis of labor produc-
tivity growth can be based on the within-sector and shift components. This de-
composition reveals three important trends in the drivers of labor productivity in 
Germany and some countries in ECA (figure 1.12). 
• The deceleration in labor productivity growth in Germany started during the 
1980s and continued in subsequent decades. Most of it was caused by weaker 
productivity growth within sectors. This pattern is also evident in other major 
European countries. 
• The contribution of sectoral shifts to overall labor productivity growth in Ger -
many changed markedly over time. Between the 1970s and the start of the 
2000s, the shift of employment toward more productive sectors increased la-
bor productivity growth by about half a percentage point. The contribution of 
sectoral shifts to labor productivity growth fell to zero after 2000 and turned 
negative around the time of the 2008 global financial crisis. The long-term 
trend of labor shifting toward sectors with higher labor productivity, and 
likely higher capital intensity, came to an end when the digital economy start-
ed in earnest (see below). The contribution to labor productivity growth of the 
shift of labor to more productive sectors was greater in Central European 
countries than in Germany before the crisis, but as in Germany, it diminished

after the crisis. This change is in line with the boom and bust in the growth in 
FDI flows to these countries (EBRD 2015; World Bank 2018). During the boom 
period, FDI inflows created high-productivity jobs. These flows plummeted 
after the crisis. The contribution of the sectoral shift to productivity declined 
also in Armenia after the crisis (box 1.2).
• Major crises—the second oil crisis of the late 1970s and the global financial 
crisis—led to a permanent loss in productivity. Even where productivity 
growth returned to the original (downward) trend, the damage of the crisis 
was not recouped. Productivity remains below the levels that would have 
been achieved had the crisis not occurred. The lasting impact of deep crises on 
productivity growth may have been caused by the loss of capital and skills 
that become obsolete or by a loss in confidence by workers who suffered ex-
tended bouts of unemployment. 
The reasons for the long-term decline in within-sector labor productivity 
growth, in many ECA countries and globally, have been debated in the economic 
literature. The change in within-sector labor productivity can be decomposed 
into changes generated by capital deepening and changes that cannot be ex-
plained (TFP). The contribution of capital deepening shrank significantly in sev-
eral, but not all, countries during the years around the 2008 crisis. And almost all 
countries experienced a decline in within-sector TFP growth. 
The literature has suggested several possible causes for the slowdown in TFP . 
First, deep reforms led to a temporary rise in productivity growth in several ECA 
A new normal in Armenia
Armenia’s economy changed markedly following 
the global crisis. Per capita GDP growth fell from 
8.4 percent a year in 2003–09 to 3.2 percent a year 
in 2010–16. Labor productivity growth was similar 
in the two periods (6.7 percent a year before the 
crisis and 6.2 percent after), but migration flows, 
employment levels, and the composition of labor 
productivity growth changed dramatically. 
During the boom, many people found jobs 
abroad, especially toward the end of the period, 
when oil revenues skyrocketed in Russia. As a 
result, Armenia’s population declined by almost 5 
percent between 2003 and 2009. At the same time, 
many jobs were created in construction and other 
nontradable sectors, to satisfy domestic demand 
fueled by remittances. The combination of emi -
gration and job creation boosted the share of the 
population that was employed from 36 percent in 
2003 to 40 percent in 2009. During those six years, 
the shift toward capital-intensive construction led to an increase in labor productivity of 4 per -
centage points a year. Within-sector productivity 
growth contributed only 2.7 percentage points to 
overall labor productivity growth, perhaps because 
elevated domestic demand reduced competitive 
pressures on the supply side. 
These patterns reversed in the aftermath of the 
crisis. Emigration slowed, the population increased 
by 1.7 percent between 2010 and 2016, and the 
construction sector and other nontradable sectors 
laid off workers. As a result, the share of the popu -
lation that was employed fell to 34 percent. The 
impact of sectoral shifts on productivity growth 
turned negative, and the within-sector contribu -
tion to annual labor productivity growth increased 
to 7.4 percentage points. The increase may have 
reflected increased competition, as domestic 
demand declined and production shifted toward 
goods and services that are tradable in interna -
tional markets.
BOX 1.218 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
countries. Productivity growth subsequently fell when major aspects of the re -
form agenda were completed. In Central Europe, reforms connected to EU acces -
sion initially boosted the growth of GDP and productivity. Reform momentum, 
and productivity growth, slowed after EU accession, in the mid-2000s (World 
Bank 2018). In Central Asia and the South Caucasus, TFP growth accelerated in 
the 1990s with institutional reforms in the early transition period. It plunged by 
the beginning of 2000s, perhaps because such benefits diminished as the room for 
further reforms narrowed. 
Second, across the world, technological changes in advanced and emerging 
economies affected the measurement and growth of productivity. The digital 
revolution that began in the 1990s led to a massive shift of resources to informa-
tion and communications technology (ICT) industries. The output of these indus-
tries is notoriously difficult to measure (for example, how does one value free 
Internet services financed by advertisements?). If the value of these new services 
is understated, then aggregate measurements of productivity may also be under -
stated, particularly if growth slows in more traditional industries that are losing 
labor and capital to the ICT sector. Given the magnitude of the slowdown, how-
ever, not all of it can be attributed to measurement issues (Syverson 2016). 
The shift to ICT industries may also be connected to lower productivity. It is 
costly and time consuming to overcome the special difficulties involved in com-
mercializing novel technologies (David 1990). Because it may take time to realize 
the return on the labor and capital moving to these new industries, shifts of labor 
and capital to (initially) low-return industries may depress aggregate productiv-
ity growth. In the United States, for example, the slowdown before the 2008 crisis 
occurred mainly in industries that produce information technology (IT) services 
or use such services intensively (Fernald 2015; Gordon 2016). 
Third, declining flexibility in some advanced countries may be reducing pro-
ductivity growth. Business dynamism has declined in the United States, as re -
flected in the drop in reallocation rates for jobs (after 1990) and workers (after 
2000) (Davis and Haltiwanger 2014), and the pace of startup creation in the 
United States declined over the 2000s (Haltiwanger 2011). Across OECD coun-
tries, productivity growth in the most advanced firms remained robust over the 
2000s, but the difference in productivity levels between leading and lagging firms 
widened (Andrews, Criscuolo, and Gal 2015; Haltiwanger 2011). This phenome-
non may have deepened the productivity slowdown if barriers to the reallocation 
of labor and capital intensified. 
Fourth, long-term trends in the global economy may be contributing to the 
slowdown in productivity growth. Aging and other demographic factors may 
account for part of the decline (Maestas, Mullen, and Powell 2016). The slow-
down in global trade integration following the crisis may also be contributing to 
slower TFP growth (Adler and others 2017). 
No single factor is responsible for the observed deceleration of productivity 
growth: long-term trends, sectoral shifts, reform momentums, and global crises 
all play roles. No silver bullet can reignite productivity growth. Policy makers 
need a diverse set of instruments to encourage innovation, build up skills and 
infrastructure, and facilitate competition. Chapter 1: Economic Developments and Prospects ● 19

Search unemployment is much higher for people entering the labor market than for 
workers who already have jobs. Cyclical changes in unemployment also tend to be more 
pronounced for young people. During crisis periods, the lack of job vacancies dispropor -
tionately hurts people entering the labor market for the first time. During economic re-
coveries the opposite happens, as the opening up of new vacancies disproportionately 
benefits newcomers to the labor market.

21Overview
• The emergence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies is part of a 
broader wave of technologies that facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) commerce, in-
dividualization of products, and flexibilization of production methods. For a 
variety of reasons, this wave gained traction after the global financial crisis a 
decade ago. Large digital platforms, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Uber, and 
Airbnb, are replacing many brick-and-mortar stores, service companies, and 
long-term employment relationships. 
• Blockchain technologies aim to go one step farther. They organize P2P trans-
actions and P2P information flows without companies that operate digital 
platforms. Whether these technologies will completely eliminate middlemen 
or whether new forms of trusted intermediaries will emerge remains to be seen. 
• Cryptocurrencies are the first—and therefore most developed—application of 
blockchain technologies. They create money without central banks and facili-
tate payments without financial institutions. The success of several cryptocur -
rencies puts competitive pressure on transaction methods by existing finan-
cial institutions. However, serious limitations have become apparent. 
Decentralized organization of markets without trusted intermediaries can be 
very costly, and the volatility of the value of cryptocurrencies is a big obstacle 
to their becoming an alternative to legal tender.Cryptocurrencies and  
Blockchain: Hype or 
Transformational  
Technologies?22 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
• Other potential applications of blockchain technologies, from smart contracts 
to decentralized databases and open source social networks, could well be-
come more transformational than cryptocurrencies. Current experiments are 
likely to result in lasting innovations, even if current applications do not stand 
the test of time.
• The emergence of blockchain technologies has triggered a flurry of activities 
in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), where people use cryptocurrencies for 
cross-border transactions and as speculative investments. Start-up companies 
are mining cryptocurrencies and providing blockchain services. Governments 
are experimenting with blockchain technologies to make their services more 
secure and more transparent. 
• Many factors provide a fertile ground for these activities in ECA. Several gov-
ernments actively support innovation by start-ups. Governments are eager to 
digitize and streamline their services. Lack of trust in existing financial inter -
mediation makes cryptocurrencies an interesting alternative in some coun-
tries. Cryptocurrencies are also used to sidestep oversight of cross-border 
transfers. Cheap electricity (in Iceland and Georgia, for example) entices the 
mining of cryptocurrencies.
• Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies pose a range of policy chal-
lenges. They include the need to (a) apply rules of financial oversight, con-
sumer protection, and tax administration while at the same time encouraging 
and facilitating innovation; (b) deal with the massive volume of electricity 
used to mine cryptocurrencies; and (c) determine whether governments and 
central banks can use blockchain technologies to improve their services. Poli-
cymakers should find a balance between curbing the hype and unleashing 
potentially transformational new opportunities. International coordination is 
needed to share best practices, avoid regulatory arbitrage, and explore how to 
regulate global decentralized networks.
Introduction
Ten years after an ingenious experiment to create a cryptocurrency that allows 
secure and anonymous digital transactions to take place without the involve -
ment of central banks or commercial banks, cryptocurrencies have become a 
multibillion-dollar industry. By December 2017, the average price of one bitcoin 
(the first cryptocurrency) had risen from just a few cents in 2009 to $15,000, dou-
bling its value in a single month. These gains attracted many investors across the 
world. On December 1, 2017, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
approved trading in bitcoin futures. Although the price of a bitcoin had declined 
to about $8,000 in April 2018, the value of bitcoins in circulation was about $150 
billion as of April 10, 2018. 
Big companies, and individuals working together in large pools, are compet-
ing for the right to add new transactions to the existing chain of transactions. 
Their revenues, in the form of new bitcoins and transaction fees, are close to $20 
million a day. Chapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 23
In the wake of bitcoin’s success, hundreds of alternative cryptocurrencies 
have been created. Digital tokens have been issued as general currency; for spe-
cific purposes (for example, to rent computer capacity or cloud storage); and as 
an alternative to traditional shares in companies. 
Cryptocurrencies have evoked strong reactions. Critics call these virtual cur -
rencies a bubble, a scam, and even evil (Krugman 2013; Popper 2018). Supporters 
predict that cryptocurrencies will ultimately replace money (Rooney 2018).
There is less disagreement about the underlying blockchain technology, a pro-
tocol to achieve decentralized consensus about the validity of a common data-
base, stored in multiple locations. Many recognize that the blockchain protocol 
can lead to tamper-proof, secure information systems without the need for a 
single administrator. But even here views differ markedly about how transforma-
tional this technology is. Believers foresee utopian societies of self-regulating in-
dividuals, without government or trusted intermediaries. Doubters argue that 
the number of useful applications has been exaggerated, that lack of regulation 
can have disastrous effects, and that in most cases trusted intermediaries will 
continue to provide useful services. 
It is unclear how these technologies will develop in the long run. Conceivably, 
they could be absorbed by existing institutions, with central banks issuing digital 
cash, governments using blockchain to maintain information systems, and com -
mercial banks putting payment systems on the blockchain.1 Many intermediaries 
might become obsolete, and many new financial instruments might be created by 
companies that do not yet exist. The main legacy of cryptocurrencies may not be 
the blockchain technology but standardized digital IDs using a combination of 
public and private keys on open-source software.2 Such a development would 
allow individuals to own more of their data, instead of participating in proprie-
tary information networks (Johnson 2018).
Whatever the future brings, cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols are 
part of a tidal wave of new technologies that is changing the way production and 
commerce are organized. Digital platforms, the sharing economy, apps, and 3D 
printers are fragmenting production and facilitating P2P transactions. 
Many of these new applications originated soon after the global financial cri-
sis of 2008, when the bankruptcies of established companies convinced many 
people that the economy would never be the same again. Investors were looking 
for new investment opportunities. Workers who had lost their jobs were willing 
to accept more flexible working relations. Consumers were persuaded to use 
some of their underutilized assets commercially. 
The fact that bitcoin was created in 2009, soon after the crisis, was probably no 
coincidence. Trust in financial institutions had eroded, and the time was ripe to 
explore fundamentally different approaches. Whatever the future of cryptocur -
rencies and blockchain technologies may be, the trends toward decentralization 
and P2P transactions are unmistakable. 
Cryptocurrency and blockchain activities are widespread in Europe and Cen-
tral Asia (ECA). Massive mining of cryptocurrencies takes place in Iceland, Swe-
den, and Georgia. Many Russians own digital wallets, and experiments are ongo-
ing in Serbia and Tajikistan to use blockchain technology to make the sending of 24 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
remittances more efficient (UNDP 2018). Estonia is using blockchain software in 
registries and plans to extend its use to medicine (https://e-estonia.com/ ). Start-
ups in many countries in ECA are contributing to these technologies, attracting 
finance for their activities via initial coin offerings (ICOs).3 Household invest-
ments in cryptocurrencies are not insignificant. Switzerland aims to become a 
cryptocurrency and blockchain hub and is leading in adjusting regulations to 
these new technologies. 
Comprehensive, global information on cryptocurrency and blockchain activi-
ties is not available. But anecdotal evidence suggests that ECA is more active than 
many other parts of the world, likely because of a combination of factors. Gov-
ernments of many countries—from Estonia to Georgia and Slovenia—are experi-
menting with blockchain technologies. In many countries in the region, a sup-
portive business climate encourages start-ups. And, especially in the eastern part 
of the region, the relatively new financial sector provides fertile ground for ex-
periments. The lack of legacy technologies in the financial sector—and the lack of 
trusted intermediaries—makes exploring new financial instruments attractive. 
The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 2.2 looks at the suc -
cesses and drawbacks of cryptocurrencies, examining whether there is a future 
for money not issued by central banks. Section 2.3 looks at the possibility of smart 
contracts. It assesses whether markets can be organized without intermediaries 
and explores the possibility of secure decentralized databases. Section 2.4 sum-
marizes some of the activities in ECA, with an emphasis on the experience in 
Georgia, which has been particularly active. Section 2.5 addresses the many pol-
icy challenges these new technologies have triggered. 
Creating digital money without central banks
Since the emergence of e-commerce, myriad attempts have been made to develop 
electronic payment systems.4 Many successful and unsuccessful attempts were 
linked to credit card systems. 
Attempts to create digital cash are especially thought-provoking. Like coins 
and banknotes, digital cash should be anonymous and counterfeit-proof. People 
should be able to use it without the intermediation of banks, in the same way 
traditional cash is used outside the banking system. But unlike traditional cash, 
individuals, rather than a central bank, would create these digital coins. Private 
parties rather than the government would thus accrue the seigniorage. 
The white paper that started bitcoin in 2008 outlined a way to create and oper -
ate a decentralized electronic cash system (Nakamoto 2008). The payment system 
would not be under the control of a bank or a central authority. Rather, a large 
number of independent participants would operate it. The paper used existing 
cryptographic techniques of public and private keys to create anonymous and 
secure IDs. It used existing cryptographic time stamps, based on hash functions, 
to make past transactions irreversible. With those elements, electronic cash could 
become (pseudo)anonymous and counterfeit-proof.5 But the main contribution 
of the white paper was the method it proposed to keep track of past transactions 
without a trusted intermediary. It would be done through an automatic process Chapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 25
that would achieve consensus among most participants about the cumulative 
history of transactions, even if a minority of participants sent erroneous messages 
to the network. 
The solution to this so-called distributed consensus problem was to let partici-
pants compete for permission to add a new batch of transactions to the decentral-
ized database. Participants use their computer power to solve a difficult puzzle. 
The solution, which is considered proof of work, is impossible to find analyti-
cally; it can be reached only through trial and error. The first person who solves 
the puzzle can add a block of new transactions to the chain of existing transac-
tions—hence the term blockchain—and broadcast the new block to the network, 
so that all participants can update the blockchain in their own copy.6 
Although the puzzle is difficult to solve, its solution is easy to verify. There-
fore, the nodes in the bitcoin network can easily determine if a proposed block is 
valid and should be added to the chain. Even if a node goes offline for a period 
of time, the network is not jeopardized. When the node goes back online, it ac -
cepts the longest valid chain as the correct one. If most of the computer power is 
owned by honest participants, the expectation is that they will create the longest 
chain, as the probability that they add new blocks is proportional to their com-
puter power. As a result, the longest chain can be considered the consensus view. 
If a dishonest participant adds a block that is not accepted by others in the chain, 
that block will not become part of the longest chain, because the participant will 
not have enough computer power to add more blocks to the chain quickly 
enough. The difficulty of the puzzle is adjusted every two weeks, in order to cre-
ate about one block per 10 minutes. Limiting the addition of a new block to the 
blockchain to one every 10 minutes (on average) prevents the network from be-
ing overwhelmed and keeps the size of the blockchain manageable. 
Competition for the right to add a block to the blockchain also solved the 
problem of the creation of new electronic coins. People who solve the puzzle re-
ceive a combination of newly minted coins and transaction fees.7 With every 
block, new coins are created. Every four years the number of new coins per block 
is cut in half, until the maximum number of 21 million bitcoins is reached. Most 
of the remaining bitcoins will be added over the next 15 years. The creation of 
new digital coins is like unearthing gold, which is why the puzzle solvers are 
called miners in the world of cryptocurrencies.
Ten years after the publication of the white paper, the concepts underlying 
bitcoin have proven successful. The blockchain technology is working and se-
cure. Seventeen million bitcoins have been created, with an aggregate value of 
$137 billion in 2018. Numerous alternative cryptocurrencies have emerged, and 
many companies and research groups are exploring additional blockchain ap-
plications. Cryptocurrencies have unleashed a wave of financial innovations, 
putting competitive pressure on the financial sector, especially its facilitation of 
cross-border transfers.
Bitcoin’s biggest success has also become its most worrisome weakness. The 
proof-of-work concept that ensured achievement of a decentralized consensus 
has become excessively costly and wasteful. Attracted by the reward of newly 
minted digital coins, investors have created massive computer power with spe-
cialized chips to compete for permission to add a block to the blockchain. Over 26 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
the past few months, the reward for solving the puzzle ranged from $100,000 to 
$250,000, depending on the price of bitcoin, the fees per transaction, and the 
number of transactions in a block. As more computer power was added to the 
network, the puzzle automatically became more difficult (figure 2.1). As a result, 
more and more electricity was needed to solve the puzzle. 
The system currently consumes an estimated 53 TWh of electricity a year—
almost as much as the entire country of Bangladesh consumes (Digiconomist 
n.d.). The cost of electricity used to process a single average transaction (about 
$20) can power about five households in a high-income country for a day. 
These electricity costs are likely to rise. Because miners’ profits of are still 
large, more computer power is being added to the network, increasing the diffi-
culty of the puzzle. People who use the network to transfer bitcoins do not di-
rectly experience these costs, because miners are paid mainly through seignior -
age rather than fees. But the costs in terms of electricity use, and the resulting 
burden on the environment, are real. 
A paradoxical side-effect of the rapid increase in computing power is that 
computer power has become more concentrated. A few companies have installed 
huge computer capacity in large dedicated factories, using specialized chips. 
Their exploitation of economies of scale leads to concentration of market power. 
Participants with less computer power started working together in pools (fig-
ure 2.2). With limited computing power, the probability of being the first to solve 
the puzzle is very small, and the income stream is irregular and thus unpredictable. 
By pooling forces, participants can generate a small but steady income stream. 
This concentration of computer power makes the network more vulnerable to 
malicious attacks. Even without attacks, if the market becomes an oligopoly, min-
ers could manipulate transaction fees, refuse to process certain types of transac-
tions, or deny service to users.

Note: The bitcoin difficulty index measures the difficulty of finding a new block on the blockchain. The greater the difficulty, the longer the time it 
takes on average for a miner to find a valid block. The difficulty in the first block of the bitcoin blockchain was 1. The difficulty is adjusted up or 
down every 2,016 blocks. If the previous 2,016 blocks take less than two weeks to generate, the difficulty is increased (and vice versa). Chapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 27

Note: Data are for March 2018. 
The danger of market concentration is likely to increase. As the number of 
newly minted bitcoins declines, the income of miners will increasingly depend 
on fees. Lower profits will discourage new investors from entering the market, 
and smaller, inefficient miners are likely to exit. The sustainability of a completely 
decentralized payment system will be tested if miners must forgo the large prof-
its coming from seigniorage. 
An advantage of declining profits because of disappearing seigniorage is that 
electricity use will no longer increase and might even decline. Box 2.1 models the 
long-term mechanisms determining the degree of difficulty of the puzzle, energy 
use, user fees, and even the price of bitcoins. The model is simplistic, particularly 
as it ignores adjustment lags and speculative bubbles, which likely play a signifi-
cant role in reality. But it sheds light on balancing mechanisms in the cryptocur -
rency market and provides a framework for exploring the consequences of the 
disappearance of seigniorage. 
As of spring 2018, the total reward a miner received per transaction was just 
below $100 (figure 2.3). Most of it comes through seignorage (the bitcoin block 
reward) rather than fees. The impact on the demand for bitcoin if this reward 
shifts away from seignorage toward fees may not be dramatic. Large interna-
tional bank transfers can involve similar levels of fees (through the SWIFT inter -
national payment system).28 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
Equilibrium mechanisms in the bitcoin market 
Over time, as fewer and fewer bitcoins are created, 
the income of miners will shift from seigniorage 
toward fees. This box models the consequences of 
the shift for electricity use and other characteristics 
of the mining process.
Assume that miners use the following produc -
tion function to solve the puzzle that allows them 
to add transactions to the blockchain: 
(2.1.1)  
where TS is the total number of transactions miners 
supply, A is the level of technology, K  is the capi -
tal stock, E  is the electricity consumption, and D 
is the difficulty of the puzzle. There is substitution 
between capital and electricity: miners can install 
more advanced, more electricity-efficient equip -
ment to achieve the same solution power with less 
electricity. 
Miners minimize costs under the restriction of 
the production function, where the cost per trans -
action is
(2.1.2)   
where c is the cost per transaction, r  is the return to 
capital, δ is the depreciation rate of the equipment,  
Ph is the price of the capital goods, and Pe is the 
price of electricity.
This optimization leads to the following cost per 
transaction c: 
(2.1.3)       
If there are profits, new miners will keep enter -
ing the market, which will cause the difficulty of the 
puzzle to adjust so that in equilibrium profits equal 
zero:
(2.1.4)  
where n is the block reward in terms of the number 
of newly minted bitcoins, p  is the price of bitcoin, 
and f are the fees. 
The market is not yet in equilibrium. Miners’ 
profits are still large, as is the risk-adjusted return. 
As a result, still more investments in computing power should be expected, which will increase the 
difficulty of the puzzle. In equilibrium, the difficulty 
of the puzzle is given by
(2.1.5)      
Demand for transactions by consumers is down -
ward sloping in the size of the transaction fees:
(2.1.6)  
where TD is the total desired number of transac -
tions miners supply, and B  is a scaling factor. The 
fees will be determined by the condition
(2.1.7)  
If consumers want more transactions than min -
ers can facilitate, fees will go up and demand for 
transactions will adjust. Miners are constrained by 
the rule that only one block with not many more 
than 2,000 transactions can be added to the block -
chain. This restriction is represented by T . Conse -
quently, fees are determined by consumer prefer -
ences and the maximum number of transactions 
allowed in the system:
(2.1.8)  
The final price to endogenize is the price of a bit -
coin. Currently, speculative behavior, which is very 
difficult to model, is likely to be one of the deter -
minants of that price. A standard money demand 
function can describe the main determinants: 
(2.1.9)  
where p is the price of bitcoin, a  is the aver -
age size of transactions, and V  is the velocity of 
money. If people want to keep bitcoins in their 
wallet because they expect the price to rise, then 
the velocity of circulation will fall and the current 
price will rise. If people want to transfer larger val -
ues with bitcoins, pushing up the average value of 
transactions, the price will also rise. These factors 
may have been the two main drivers behind the 
sharp increase in the bitcoin price in December 
BOX 2.1

(continued)
2017. Market participants bought bitcoins to trans -
fer large sums, and speculation pushed the price 
farther up. In equilibrium the bitcoin price would 
be given by
(2.1.10)  
where MS is the exogenously given number of bit -
coins in circulation. Substituting this result in the 
difficulty expression yields
(2.1.11)      
The reduced-form equation for energy use per 
transaction is
(2.1.12)  
This model suggests that the system could 
achieve a long-term equilibrium in which electricity 
consumption is lower because fewer bitcoins are created. A decline in n  reduces the energy use per 
transaction. Increasing the price of energy can also 
reduce energy use. Such a price increase would 
not increase the cost of transactions, it would 
merely reduce the difficulty of the puzzle, as some 
miners are pushed out of the market. Increasing 
the overall energy efficiency of mining (increasing 
A in equation 2.1.1) does not reduce energy use. It 
merely makes the puzzle more difficult. 
The long-term equilibrium can be achieved at a 
lower electricity use, but this raises other concerns. 
It could lead to even more concentration of min -
ing power, as in the process many miners would 
exit the market, making it easier for highly special -
ized mining facilities to capture larger shares of the 
computational power. The concentration of mining 
power could erode trust in the network and thus 
reduce incentives to hold bitcoins long, increasing 
the velocity of money, which would cause a drop 
in the price and further instability in the network.

The lack of scalability of the bitcoin payment system is another limitation. The 
proof-of-work concept prevents malicious participants from overwhelming the 
blockchain, ensuring its veracity. But it limits the addition of new blocks to one 
every 10 minutes and each block to a maximum size of 1 MB. The average num-
ber of transactions that can be included in a block of this size is 2,000. In its cur -
rent form, the bitcoin payment network can thus process only three transactions 
per second. By contrast, credit card companies process thousands of transactions 
per second. This constraint makes it impossible for bitcoin to substitute for large-
scale digital payment systems.
Many attempts have been made, through new cryptocurrencies or additions 
to the bitcoin network, to avoid the electricity-consuming puzzle and to increase 
scalability. A leading concept is proof of stake, which could replace proof of 
work.8 In this concept, participants are elected to add a new block to the block-
chain on the basis of the amount of own coins they want to attach to the contract. 
This proof-of-stake concept is like putting coins in escrow to earn permission to 
intermediate and charge transaction fees. Selection would still be probabilistic, 
but richer participants would have a higher probability of being selected. Ethe-
reum, which runs a popular cryptocurrency, may adopt this approach. It repre-
sents a shift back in the direction of trusted intermediaries. The concept is not 
very different from existing financial institutions that are trusted because they 
have a stake in preserving their company. 
An even more radical departure from proof of work is to grant the authority 
to maintain the blockchain to a limited number of preselected, trusted partici-
pants. Ripple has taken this approach, working with commercial banks. It rein-
states trusted intermediaries into the blockchain network. 
Another experiment to reduce electricity costs is to design a simple, albeit less 
secure, system for small transactions and to put only the balances of many small 
transactions on the blockchain. Lightning Network is taking this approach, as an 
addition to the bitcoin blockchain (Poon and Dryja 2016).
Most of the discussions in the cryptocurrency community are about mecha-
nisms to make trusted intermediaries superfluous. But another important ques-
tion is how well cryptocurrencies perform the traditional functions of money. 
Money is useful because it can serve as medium of exchange, a unit of account, 
and a store of value. Like other forms of electronic money, cryptocurrencies have 
advantages over physical commodities like gold or banknotes. They are easier to 
store and easier to transfer over large distances. However, some inherent draw-
backs of cryptocurrencies make them less optimal than legal tender in most 
countries. 
The most important drawback is the volatility of the purchasing power of 
cryptocurrencies, as illustrated by their exchange rate vis-à-vis legal tender (fig-
ure 2.4). That volatility in purchasing power makes them very risky to accept as 
a medium of exchange. It also makes them suboptimal as a store of value, as there 
is no guarantee that their value will not drop to zero. Advocates argue that cryp-
tocurrencies cannot be inflationary, because their supply is fixed or at least lim-
ited. In fact, cryptocurrencies can be extremely inflationary if demand for them Chapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 31
drops (because, for example, customers prefer alternative cryptocurrencies that 
are more user-friendly, are more scalable, or provide more privacy). The volatility 
of their purchasing power also reduces the value of cryptocurrencies as a unit of 
measurement. With large overall price swings, it becomes difficult to discern 
movements in relative prices.9 
In fact, there may be a natural limit to how stable the price of bitcoin can be-
come. Unlike other commodity-type assets, bitcoin does not have a feedback loop 
from the supply side. Source: coinmarketcap.com.

Sustained volatility can be very inefficient for a bitcoin-based economy. Ex-
tracting information about relative prices would be very costly. Entering into 
long-term contracts could become prohibitively expensive. 
The blockchain has proven to be very secure, but it is impossible to avoid se-
curity concerns altogether. Cryptocurrencies have been stolen by hacks into ex-
changes, where they are exchanged against legal tender or other cryptocurren-
cies, and hacks into mining pools. Users can protect stored cryptocurrencies by 
keeping their wallets offline. These offline wallets are called cold wallets; wallets 
that are online are called hot wallets. Exchanges cannot be avoided; they remain a 
weak link. The problem is especially severe because once stolen there is little re-
course to recover the funds.
Many of these problems are already being addressed. The security breaches of 
exchange sites forced many exchanges to use hot and cold wallets. This practice 
involves storing most deposits in an offline wallet, whose private keys are secure 
and are never stored on a network-connected device. A small portion of the de-
posits is transferred to the hot wallet, which is used for daily transactions and 
payments. If there is a security breach, potential losses are limited to the amount 
stored in the hot wallet; at least in theory, most deposits should be protected.
The attractiveness of cryptocurrencies will be tested once governments extend 
their financial oversight to cryptocurrencies in their efforts to fight money laun-
dering, tax evasion, and illicit transactions. Doing so will challenge the (pseudo)
anonymity of the cryptocurrencies. This oversight will be easier if the concentra-
tion of mining power continues to increase. To the extent that current use is mo-
tivated partly by the desire to avoid oversight, increased surveillance will reduce 
demand for cryptocurrencies. However, it is also possible that oversight may 
make the use of cryptocurrencies more attractive, as it becomes easier to incorpo-
rate them in the overall financial infrastructure. 
The innovative power of cryptocurrencies has been impressive. They have 
already put some competitive pressure on cross-border payment systems. The 
concept is promising, because it potentially improves financial access for people 
who live in remote areas that are not covered by financial institutions. 
It would be wrong to judge cryptocurrencies on the current state of affairs. As 
with many new technologies, childhood diseases will be outgrown. However, their 
real contribution may turn out to be very different from originally foreseen. 
The original designer of bitcoin and the blockchain technology wrote that “the 
main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required” (Nakamoto 2008). 
In fact, the future benefits may appear precisely because the networks shift back 
to trusted intermediaries. It is even conceivable that the most successful crypto-
currencies will be linked to legal tender and issued by central banks. 
Creating digital markets without intermediaries
The ability to achieve distributed consensus, and to store immutable information 
in a decentralized database, makes a wide variety of P2P contracts possible with-
out a centralized authority. Enthusiasm about other possibilities is enormous. As 
one observer put it, “The paradox about bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be Chapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 33
a revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a cur -
rency” (Johnson 2018). 
Smart, or self-executing, contracts are examples of blockchain applications 
that go well beyond instantaneous transfers of funds with cryptocurrencies. Such 
contracts could be used on a blockchain platform to engage in commitments over 
time, without the help of middlemen. Ethereum, which has been operational 
since the summer of 2015, enables the creation of P2P contracts that outline the 
conditions under which future payments occur. 
One example of such a smart contract is a parametric insurance contract, such 
as a contract that insures farmers against drought. The seller commits to pay a 
certain amount if rainfall remains below a certain threshold. The contract is pre-
programmed to read the realized rainfall from a trusted weather data feed at a 
point in the future. The buyer purchases the contract with a one-time payment. 
The seller commits funds equal to the maximum payout in case of a drought. As 
the contract is fully collateralized, there is no counterparty risk. At the expiration 
date, either the buyer or the seller can execute the contract to check if the trigger 
condition has been met. The contract distributes the funds between the buyer and 
the seller and terminates itself. This type of contract could be handled without 
intermediation (although insurance companies could also provide such con-
tracts). Storing these contracts on the blockchain makes them immutable and 
guarantees their enforcement.
Smart contracts could also be used for financial instruments other than insur -
ance. Entrepreneurs already sell tokens to fund new companies through ICOs 
and promise future dividend payments in a smart contract on a blockchain. The 
tokens are similar to shares issued in an initial public offering (IPO), but there are 
key differences. Shares are sold on stock markets and typically give the right via 
shareholder representation to participate in decision making. In contrast, tokens 
are traded on a P2P blockchain with no privileges outside what is written in the 
smart contract. Regulators across the world are working on directives that would 
extend oversight to ICOs. Doing so would increase the similarities between ICOs 
and IPOs, but the financial smart contract would provide a new, innovative, in-
strument to fund start-ups. It creates relatively liquid new financial instruments 
that can be used to finance small-scale risky ventures.
The potential advantages of such P2P contracts are obvious. They could be 
available to people who have no access to financial instruments (box 2.2). They 
could also increase access to financial services that is now limited because of 
distrust in financial institutions. Currently, enforcement of contracts is not 
straightforward in parts of ECA. Smart contracts are secure, even if the counter -
parties do not know each other. Blockchain platforms could make these financial 
products more liquid if the new products could be traded outside specialized 
markets. 
There are potential disadvantages of smart contracts. Adjustments to the cur -
rent blockchain platforms are likely required for them to work in a user-friendly, 
efficient, and scalable way. These drawbacks may be the reason why, outside 
ICOs, there have not yet been large-scale applications of smart contracts. 
The first disadvantage of existing platforms is the volatility of the value of 
cryptocurrencies, which is especially inconvenient with contracts that span many 34 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
Providing access to secure insurance
In many countries, individuals, farmers, and 
small- to medium-size businesses have limited or 
no access to insurance or hedging instruments 
for commodity price risks, floods, hurricanes, 
exchange rate volatility, and the like. Markets are 
incomplete or not available. When they are avail -
able, contracts are often not trusted to be enforced 
or are very costly, particularly for small transac -
tions. Lack of this key financial service is associated 
with a high risk of falling into poverty, business fail -
ure, and the absence of entrepreneurship. 
Suppose that a small wheat farmer in a develop -
ing country is 30 days away from harvest. Although 
she may be happy with the current wheat price, she 
knows that she can sustain at most a 20 percent 
drop between now and the time she sells her har -
vest. In order to hedge against a larger decline, the 
farmer can purchase a put option with a duration 
of one month and a strike that is 20 percent lower 
than the current market price. Entering in such a 
contract will ensure that if the price falls below the 
strike price, the contract will pay the difference. 
The contract mitigates the risk by creating a price 
floor. 
Despite the relative simplicity of these con -
tracts, many frictions may prevent small farmers 
from entering into such agreements. Although 
bilateral over-the-counter agreements are pos -
sible, the legal framework may not be well adapted 
to accommodate them, and enforcement can be 
difficult and costly. Small- and medium-size farm -Especially in the transition economies of ECA, 
financial markets are incomplete. Market-based 
financial institutions were established only in the 
early 1990s in these economies, and they are still 
only partially developed. Insurance products are 
particularly underdeveloped. The insurance rate 
of farmers in ECA is well below the global aver -
age (box figure 2.2.1). A recent report finds that 
these incomplete financial sectors are associated 
with lower growth of the bottom 40 percent of the 
income distribution (Gould and Melecky 2017). 
ers are not likely to have access to international 
financial markets in which these contracts are well 
established and markets are deep, and the need 
for intermediaries can make the process prohibi -
tively expensive. 
Government interventions to support such con -
tracts have often been ineffective. Such policies 
are either too costly from the government fiscal 
standpoint or create moral hazard if noninsured 
risks are covered by government payouts in the 
event of widespread loss. 
Blockchain technology and smart contracts 
raise the potential for insurance/minimum price 
contracts that are flexible, low-cost, secure, and 
highly customizable to a multitude of risks and 
payouts (large and small), with only marginal trans -
actions costs. This approach would provide easy 
access to foreign insurers, and enforcement costs 
would be low if the payout were collateralized in 
the blockchain.

years. Parties to the contract likely want security in terms of the purchasing 
power of payments. That goal could possibly be met by linking the contracts to 
futures markets, but it seems more promising to use tokens that are linked to le-
gal tender. Doing so would be a major step away from the original concept of 
cryptocurrencies, as it requires a trusted party that can guarantee the value of the 
token. Still, it could be a natural development of the smart contracts. 
Fizzy is a parametric insurance application by the insurance company AXA 
(https://fizzy.axa/), in which passengers purchase insurance by sending funds 
to the smart contract along with their flight information. If their flight is delayed 
for more than two hours according to a publicly accessible database, the smart 
contracts pays out compensation in euros. Fizzy could be developed into an 
Ethereum-based smart contract, but the volatility of the Ether token is likely to 
prove too much of a drawback for a large-scale application. 
If contracts shift to tokens that are linked to legal tender, the market can no 
longer operate without a trusted intermediary. Such an intermediary must sell 
additional tokens in exchange for legal tender if demand for tokens increases. 
The intermediary must hold part of the legal tender in reserve, so that tokens can 
be repurchased if demand declines. Such reserves are similar to the reserves fi -
nancial institutions must hold when they create electronic accounts or mobile 
payment systems. In the case of tokens linked to legal tender, participants who 
maintain the blockchain would no longer be rewarded with the seigniorage of 
new coins; the reward would consist only of fees paid by the parties in the con-
tract. These fees might not be enough to attract enough participants who want to 
compete with one another. It is plausible that such a system would naturally 
converge to a permissioned blockchain, in which several preselected servers up-
date the blockchain, eliminating the need for costly competition among servers 
and making the maintenance of the platform more efficient. 
A second disadvantage of smart contracts is that they are collateralized by 
freezing potential payouts on the blockchain. The blockchain provides security, 
but it is also inefficient (like putting money in escrow, where it cannot be used 
productively). Insurance companies can pool risks and invest the cash flow. As a 
result, they should be able to provide cheaper services than offered in P2P con-
tracts, in which investing the cash flow is not possible. Cutting out insurance 
companies could thus increase costs. 
There may be a trade-off between efficiency and independence from interme-
diaries. Higher costs may be worth paying where the public does not trust that 
normal contracts will be enforced. Where trust exists, the public might prefer to 
deal with insurance companies rather than anonymous peers. If blockchain con-
tracts are used, trusted intermediaries will likely offer contracts without freezing 
the assets in the contract, reintroducing trust into these transactions. 
A similar argument holds for standard financial intermediation by banks. Be-
cause P2P contracts likely have a broader reach and can create innovative instru-
ments, they could provide competitive additions to existing banking products. 
However, commercial banks have a big advantage in financial intermediation. By 
pooling risk, they can turn short-term liabilities into long-term assets. Because 
intermediation between savings and investments is much more difficult in inde-
pendent P2P contracts without risk pooling, smart contracts are likely to be com -36 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
bined with, or even integrated into, existing financial institutions, rather than 
replacing them. Risk pooling could also be explicitly programmed in smart con-
tracts, implying that these contracts will not be completely risk free. 
A third potential disadvantage of following the original blockchain design for 
smart contracts is the public nature of the blockchain. Transparency is attractive 
because it makes it easy to audit the validity of contracts by virtually anyone with 
an Internet connection. But participants in transactions may want more privacy. 
Therefore, it is plausible that smart contract applications will develop in the di-
rection of more encryption, more restricted-read access, or both.10 
Many governments are experimenting with blockchain to digitize their ser -
vices. Experiments with land and real estate registries are popular. One objective 
is to avoid the vulnerabilities of a centralized server. Decentralized storage of 
data means that several servers are always online, making it more difficult to 
alter data. 
Another objective is to prepare for a link with smart contracts, so that real es-
tate could be sold online without the help of notaries, as ownership could be veri-
fied on the blockchain. Governments would still take responsibility for the infor -
mation, including information about zoning and restrictions on sales. The goal is 
thus not to purge governments from transactions but rather to make government 
services more efficient and more trustworthy. 
In these applications, the registry can be updated by a limited, selected num-
ber of servers (a permissioned approach). There is no need to let an undeter -
mined number of miners compete for the updates. There is, however, a need for 
full transparency. Not everyone should be able to write on the system, but every-
one should be able to read the registry. The reading provides the actual service 
and is also a mechanism for double-checking the veracity of the information.
Another government application could be public procurement. The central 
government could issue a token backed by the national currency. Each ministry 
or municipality could be issued an address and allocated tokens as part of the 
budget process. They would use the tokens to pay contractors for public pur -
chases; contractors would redeem their tokens with the central government. This 
mechanism would make all purchases not only fully transparent but also in-
stantly auditable by anyone, reducing graft. Social protection transfers could 
benefit from a similar set-up, although privacy concerns would have to be 
addressed. 
Large companies are also exploring blockchain applications. Companies need 
to be online all the time, for internal communications and communications with 
clients. One central server is not reliable in this respect; a system that provides a 
common view of information through communication between independent 
servers is superior to a central server. Decentralized information is also more dif-
ficult to alter through hacks, because hackers would have to break into more than 
one server. 
Companies are experimenting with different versions of the blockchain proto-
col to transition toward a more decentralized information strategy. Experiments 
are moving toward permissioned systems, with a preselected number of servers 
maintaining the decentralized database. Decentralizing reduces the probability 
that participating servers become malicious, makes it easier to secure them, and Chapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 37
prevents the costly competition that is needed in a permission-less system. The 
decentralized consensus problem is easier to solve than in the original bitcoin 
application. However, with a small number of servers, data systems other than 
blockchain could be used. The advantages of a permissioned system may be the 
reason why there are no large-scale blockchain applications yet in these compa-
nies, despite the many experiments. 
Blockchain technology could also be used to manage vast and diverse data 
systems, such as health records, that are too complicated for a central server. They 
could benefit from decentralized servers that communicate with one another and 
always reflect the latest update of treatments and test results. The existence of 
secure, decentralized digital health records could significantly increase the effi-
ciency of the health care industry. 
The main challenge for these kinds of data systems is privacy. Both reading 
and writing of health records should be limited. This requires adjustments to the 
original blockchain design, which is public, in the sense that everyone can read 
it. A health record application would be private, with secure encryption to protect 
confidentiality of medical information. 
These examples show the broad range of potential applications of blockchain. 
They also suggest that many of them could be very different from the original 
blockchain design. Instead of a public database, with an unlimited number of 
participants that maintain the blockchain and an independent cryptocurrency to 
be used in transactions, the most successful future applications could work with 
private information, a limited number of permissioned servers, and a token 
linked to legal tender for transactions. 
The most important components of those future applications could become 
the cryptography behind personal IDs, the time stamps that make data irrevers-
ible, and the open source character of the platform. These applications would not 
eliminate trusted intermediaries, they would make more competition between 
intermediaries possible. Digital platforms like Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, and Ama-
zon use proprietary software and organize their own user IDs; the veracity of 
their data is not protected through decentralized storage. All these platforms can 
gain natural monopoly power because of network effects, because the platforms 
become more useful and more powerful if more people participate. A standardize 
system of digital IDs and open-source networks could break that monopoly and 
increase entry opportunities. Experiments with P2P digital interactions are very 
important for this reason. Even if current applications do not stand the test of 
time, the ultimate result could well be transformational. 
Blockchain applications in Europe and Central Asia 
Many countries in ECA have provided fertile ground for cryptocurrencies and 
blockchain technologies, especially since late 2016. When cryptocurrencies 
emerged, almost 10 years ago, activities were small-scale. As everywhere else in 
the world, early transactions were used largely for gambling or for the purchase 
illegal products on the dark web (figure 2.5).11 38 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
The use of cryptocurrencies intensified at the end of 2016, especially for large 
cross-border transfers. When the prices of cryptocurrencies skyrocketed in 2017, 
investments in mining capacity increased sharply and people began investing in 
cryptocurrencies in the hope of benefitting from further price rises.
Investments in blockchain technologies surged. Governments in many ECA 
countries began experimenting with blockchain to improve their services. Some 
central banks are studying the issuance of legal tender in the form of digital cur -
rency, and financial institutions are piloting blockchain applications to incorpo-
rate them in the existing financial architecture. 
ECA has become an important center for ICOs. In terms of the number of 
projects, the Russian Federation ranks third globally (with 8.8 percent of all proj-
ects), Switzerland fifth (6.9 percent), Estonia seventh (3.0 percent), and Lithuania 
eighth (2.8 percent) (figure 2.5). This section examines the reasons for the strong 
interest in blockchain technologies in ECA, based on anecdotal evidence. 
Blockchain technologies, which place a heavy emphasis on making financial 
intermediaries redundant, are particularly attractive in countries where trust in Source: blockchain.info.

FIGURE 2.5  Early use of bitcoin was clustered around gambling and the dark webChapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 39
financial institutions is lacking, people want to avoid oversight, and/or financial 
sectors are underdeveloped (Aris 2017). Countries where corruption and political 
instability are higher, confidence in the rule of law is lower, and regulatory qual-
ity is lower tend to adopt bitcoin more rapidly (all four correlations shown in 
figure 2.6 are statistically significant). 
A prime example is Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela, where people seek 
alternatives for the bolivar, the value of which been eroded by hyperinflation. 
Such extreme examples of hyperinflation no longer exist in ECA. Nevertheless, 
some anecdotal evidence suggests that weak institutions or vulnerable banks are 
one reason behind the interest in cryptocurrencies.12 Financial dollarization 
remains substantial in the eastern part of the region, reflecting lack of trust in

existing legal tender. It has resulted in much lower savings at banks than in other 
parts of the world (Gould and Melecky 2017). Households are looking for alter -
native saving options. 
Another reason for the use of blockchain technologies in ECA is the desire to 
develop alternative means of transferring large funds. Russia is the largest issuer 
(more than $956 million)—followed by the United States ($811 million) and Swit-
zerland ($514 million)—because of the $850 million raised for the TON block-
chain.13 One of the goals of that ambitious project is to provide an alternative to 
the SWIFT international interbank payment system (Aris 2017). Russia also has 
the largest number of users of the digital wallet on blockchain.com (UNDP 2018). 
Despite these examples, it is doubtful that ICOs will have a broader application 
as venture capital if security is not built in for investors. 
Established financial centers are striving to adjust to meet the competition 
from a disruptive technology like blockchain. Switzerland is leading in adjusting 
financial regulations to cover ICOs, ensuring that they are incorporated into the 
existing financial architecture rather than developed as an outside alternative 
(see Atkins 2018a, 2018b; Financial Times 2018). Its aims to become a cryptocur -
rency and blockchain hub is reflected in its vibrant ICO activities. For example, 
Sirin Labs raised $157 million for the development of a blockchain-based smart-
phone. In line with these developments, a Swiss foundation, advised by Jacob 
Frenkel, chairman of JPMorgan Chase International, and Nobel laureate Myron 
Scholes, raised $50 million to develop a cryptocurrency backed by Special Draw-
ing Rights (SDRs). Saga would have a stable value and be integrated into the 
existing financial sector, including anti-money-laundering checks, with deposits 
in the International Monetary Fund’s SDR holdings. France is also planning a 
regulatory framework for ICOs (Aris 2017). 
Governments in ECA are accumulating in-house experience with blockchain 
pilots to improve government services. Estonia, Georgia, and Ukraine have ex-
perimented with blockchain to set up land and real estate registries. They are still 
searching for more specialized and more efficient designs, but the experiments 
have given a boost to efforts to digitize government services. 
Some government banks in ECA are seeking to improve their services through 
the use of blockchain technologies. The Russian state-owned VEB bank is pilot-
ing a new blockchain-based payment system with the regional government of 
Kaliningrad (Milano 2018). Another state-owned bank, Sberbank, is partnering 
with Russia’s federal anti-monopoly service to use blockchain technologies to 
store and transfer documents. 
Official bodies in ECA are investing in blockchain research to improve ser -
vices. The European Commission has funded a blockchain observatory to en-
courage blockchain technologies and help formulate policy recommendations, 
especially for smart contracts and the improvement of government services 
(Young 2017; Nicholson 2018). Lithuania has opened a blockchain center to incu-
bate start-ups, partnering with similar centers in Melbourne and Shanghai (Med-
iTelegraph 2017). Separately, the central bank of Lithuania offers a one-year sand-
box environment for start-ups that develop new digital financial technologies. 
Estonia is exploring opportunities to use blockchain technologies in medicine Chapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 41
(https://e-estonia.com/).Georgia is investigating the possibility of supporting 
smart contracts. Serbia and Tajikistan are experimenting with remittances on 
blockchain, in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP 2018). Azerbaijan is experimenting with digital IDs for banking using 
blockchain (SputnikInternational 2018). The Swedish central bank is considering 
launching its own digital currency (Aris 2017). 
Small ECA countries with a supportive business climate and the absence of 
legacy financial instruments are well placed to introduce new financial instru-
ments based on blockchain technologies. Tokenization and ICOs enable small 
start-ups, which lack easy access to finance, to raise funds in global markets. 
Dynamic start-ups in the Baltic countries and several other small countries, in-
cluding Georgia, have issued ICOs (figure 2.7). These examples are instructive for 
other economies in the region that have long been dominated by state-owned 
enterprises and have grown primarily through the nontradable sectors. For many 
of those economies, the challenge is to unleash new growth potential in

internationally competitive sectors. The new P2P technologies provide a gateway 
to these markets. More specifically, activities on and contributions to blockchain 
networks are automatically exposed to international competition.
Seemingly more than in other parts of the world, governments in ECA are 
restraining natural monopolies of tech giants. People in the region show strong 
privacy concerns when data become proprietary and are captured by tech com -
panies. The open character of the blockchain architecture could break the mo-
nopoly on data. Several governments and the European Commission are looking 
at the possibility of using the new technologies to reduce the power of large digi-
tal network companies. 
The anecdotal evidence presented here suggests that there may be multiple 
explanations for the blockchain activities in Europe and Central Asia: 
• In the eastern part of the region, market-based financial sectors are relatively 
new and have not fully matured. Insurance and capital markets are underde-
veloped. Land registration and cadasters of real estate can still be improved. 
Blockchain technologies could help fill these gaps. 
• Vulnerabilities in the banking sectors after the transition in 1991, the global 
financial crisis in 2008, and the plunge in oil prices in 2014 have eroded trust 
in financial institutions. In the eastern part of the region, bank deposits are 
exceptionally low, and consumers are looking for alternative ways to invest 
their savings (Gould and Melecky 2017)
• Throughout the region, banks dominate financial sectors. Venture capital that 
does not require collateral is scarce. New forms of fund raising could help tech 
start-ups that have a potential to grow quickly in competitive global markets. 
• Demand for new ways of making cross-border transfers is strong. Remittanc-
es are large in the region; the high transactions costs associated with them is 
onerous. The region also has a large share of illicit financial flows, linked to 
money laundering, tax evasion, and the circumventing of capital controls or 
sanctions. 
• Governments in the region provide a broad range of services. They oversee 
elaborate social security systems, and most of them play an integrating role in 
health care, pensions, and education. There is continuous demand to make 
these services more efficient and more transparent. Many governments are 
experimenting with blockchain technologies to achieve those goals. 
• Governments in the region are looking for ways to break the power of large 
tech companies and increase privacy.
It is unclear which experiments will have a lasting impact. The transforma-
tional impact may come from applications that are very different from the origi-
nal blockchain design. The blockchain experiment has already boosted innova-
tion and competition, in both the private sector and government. For that reason 
alone, blockchain experiments deserve support. 
ECA is active in the mining of cryptocurrencies. Georgia is home to one of the 
largest mining companies of the world (Bitfury) as well as many smaller miners 
(box 2.3). Bitfury, which is building additional facilities in Canada, Iceland, and 
Norway, controls about 10–15 percent of global mining. Chapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 43
Cryptocurrency mining and the demand for electricity in Georgia
Mining of cryptocurrencies is surprisingly wide -
spread in Georgia, thanks to tax exemptions and 
low electricity prices. Indeed, Georgia has had the 
fastest-growing electricity consumption per capita 
in all of ECA since 2009 (box figure 2.3.1). 
This process was jumpstarted when Bitfury, one 
of the world’s largest bitcoin miners, built a 20MW 
data center in Gori and a 40MW mining facility in 
Tbilisi, with funding from the Georgian Co-Invest -
ment Fund. The Tbilisi facility, located in a free 
industrial zone, has daily revenue of $250,000–
$400,000. Bitfury recently sold this facility to its 
Chinese partner, Asian Chong Sing Holdings. It 
is now building mobile data centers to be sold to 
other investors. Other companies have built mining 
facilities in free industrial zones in Kutaisi.
Many households have joined mining pools. 
Surveys indicate that up to 5 percent of house -
holds in Georgia are engaged in cryptocurrency 
mining or investments. 
These mining activities have had a striking 
impact on electricity consumption, turning Geor -
gia from a net exporter to a net importer of elec -
tricity. Estimates of the share of Georgia’s elec -
tricity demand devoted to cryptocurrency mining 
range from 10 to 15 percent—and the figure could 
be even higher, because it is difficult to observe 
small-scale mining activities. Per capita electricity 
consumption in Georgia was 3,343 KWh in 2016, 
almost three times higher than in countries with 
similar levels of per capita income. Even after cor -
recting for historically high electricity consump -
tion in Georgia (likely because of the availability 
of inexpensive hydropower), energy use in recent 
years is remarkable. Between 2014 and 2016, per 
capita energy consumption increased by 655 
KWh, of which only 65 KWh can be explained by 
rises in income. Some 590 KWh, or 18 percent of 
total demand, remains unexplained. Even before 
2015—actually, since the start of bitcoin, in 2009—
the unexplained part of electricity demand was ris -
ing (box figure 2.3.2).

Cryptocurrency mining is also booming in Iceland (Perper 2018), which is on 
track to use more electricity for mining than it uses to power all of its residences. 
Armenia is set to be home to a 50MW mining farm (Murphy and Stafford 2018). 
Slush Pool, a bitcoin mining pool with a market share of about 7 percent and 
many participants from all over the world, is run by Satoshi Labs, a mining com-
pany based in the Czech Republic. KnCMiner is a mining pool in Sweden. An-
other mining pool is in Russia. 
Cryptocurrency mining thrives in a cold climate (avoiding the need for cool-
ing) and in areas where electricity costs are low. En+ Group, a Russian energy 
company, is preparing to offer electricity to cryptocurrency miners at five plants 
in Siberia (Marson 2017; Helms 2018). The electricity capacity available for min-
ers could well dwarf the capacity of existing mining facilities in ECA. EN+ could 
attract Chinese miners, who are currently dominant players in the global market 
but find a less and less hospitable environment in China. (continued)
 BOX 2.3
Of course, the mining of cryptocurrencies also 
raises incomes. Mining revenues in Georgia could 
well contribute several percentage points to GDP, 
even if these revenues are not registered as part 
of GDP (if they were registered, they would prob -
ably be classified as exports). What is observable is 
the additional consumption and imports not only 
of electricity and computer parts but also of more 
general consumption financed by the mining reve -
nues. This increase is similar to the increase in con -
sumption as a result of large inflows of remittances. It would be interesting to see how the financing 
of these activities shows up in the balance of pay -
ments. Revenues in cryptocurrencies are likely 
exchanged into legal tender at exchanges abroad, 
after which part of the legal tender is transferred 
back to Georgia. 
Investment opportunities in mining cryptocur -
rencies likely attract foreign direct investment. It is 
too early to draw conclusions about the spillovers 
to other sectors of the economy. It may trigger 
other innovative activities, or it could crowd out 
investments in other activities.FIGURE B2.3.2  Une xplained electricity demand in Georgia has risen rapidly since 2009

These mining activities illustrate the dynamic response to new opportunities 
by entrepreneurs in the region. They bode well for the development of other ap-
plications of these technologies. But the heavy electricity use by companies that 
compete for the right to mine cryptocurrencies is a growing problem. How to 
accommodate and mitigate growing electricity demand from cryptocurrency 
miners and prepare for future declines in demand if mining activities relocate or 
mining stops altogether in its current form are the most urgent challenges as 
these markets develop. 
There are multiple approaches to meeting these challenges. The cryptocur -
rency community is looking for more efficient ways to update the blockchain. 
Governments are reconsidering their tariff policies; in order to curtail energy use, 
they need to raise electricity tariffs for miners or create more market-based mech-
anisms to determine tariffs. If unchecked, electricity use could rise before alterna-
tives are found, possibly resulting in long-term damage to the environment. In 
addition, the fiscal costs of investments in power plants (or contingent liabilities, 
where new power plants are developed in partnership with the private sector) 
could threaten public finances if demand for electricity driven by cryptocurren-
cies collapses. 
Policy challenges
Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies pose difficult challenges for pol-
icy makers. There is no regulatory framework for transfers made with cryptocur -
rencies or smart contracts. Transfers occur outside anti-money-laundering com-
pliance programs, and smart contracts are not subject to consumer protection 
laws or financial oversight. 
Tax codes do not fully cover the new markets if cryptocurrencies are not rec-
ognized in the law as payment systems but are instead viewed as commodities. 
It is difficult to determine the geographic location of the value added created by 
cryptocurrency mining. Tax legislation therefore has to be adjusted to incorporate 
these new activities into direct and indirect tax systems. 
Another ambiguity for policy makers is whether these new activities should 
be supported or constrained. Should they be encouraged because of positive ex-
ternalities and first-mover benefits? Or should they be constrained, because they 
crowd out investments with greater social return? 
Another pertinent question for policy makers is whether and how they can 
use these technologies to improve their own services. 
It is too early to offer specific advice, because there is still great uncertainty 
about the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. But experi -
ences with other digital technologies—such as e-commerce, digital platforms, 
and the sharing economy—suggest that the following general guidelines should 
be followed.
• Give the new technologies space, and avoid imposing restrictive legislation before 
initial ambiguities are resolved. Even if these technologies are ultimately unsuc-
cessful, the experiments can help develop entrepreneurial skills, put competi-
tive pressure on more traditional activities, and trigger innovations in other 46 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
sectors. A dynamic business climate should encourage innovations, experi-
ments, and risk taking.
• Make implicit subsidies explicit, and be clear about risks. If activities are not yet 
covered by the tax code or are undertaken in special economic zones, the im-
plicit subsidy and its temporary nature should be calculated and made public. 
Consumers should be warned about risks, such as the risks associated with 
volatile cryptocurrencies.
• Start planning for leveling the playing field. If these technologies become success -
ful, they should be integrated into the formal economy. Tax codes and regula-
tions should be adjusted, so that both old and new technologies operate on a 
level playing field.14
• Innovate as government. The corporate motto “think big, start small, quit soon, 
and scale fast” is relevant for governments, too. Blockchain technologies pro-
vide a stimulus to further digitize government services. Most successful gov-
ernments are bold in their ideas, know when to terminate experiments that are 
not successful, and have the professionalism to quickly scale small experi-
ments that are promising. 
An undesirable side effect of the cryptocurrencies is the outsized use of elec-
tricity in mining. If mining companies pay a lower electricity price than the mar -
ginal cost of supplying more electricity, governments should consider raising 
tariffs or at least calculating the implicit subsidy. The sharp increase in electricity 
demand might be an opportunity to develop an electricity market with intra-day 
price fluctuations, so that price differentiation reflects actual costs. Uncertainty 
about future electricity demand for cryptocurrency mining warrants a rethinking 
of contingent liabilities of governments where additional power plants are built 
by public-private partnerships. Guarantees related to future demand for electric-
ity used in cryptocurrency mining are riskier than for other electricity demand. 
At some point, electricity tariffs for mining could be used as indirect taxation of 
the value added created by miners. Although it is difficult to determine the geo-
graphic location of the output of these activities, it is easy to locate the inputs. 
Ultimately, financial oversight will cover cryptocurrencies and smart con-
tracts. This process will be a gradual one of trial and error, and it will depend on 
the direction in which blockchain applications develop. First steps have already 
been taken, in the United States (where bitcoin can be traded on futures markets), 
in Switzerland (where regulation of ICOs was proposed), and in the Netherlands 
(where guidance was provided about the tax treatment of cryptocurrency hold-
ings). Oversight to prevent money laundering, tax evasion, pump-and-dump 
schemes, and illicit cross-border transfers focuses on transactions in which cryp-
tocurrencies are exchanged for legal tender.15 At some point, this oversight could 
extend to miners and other companies that update the blockchain. The ultimate 
goal of all these efforts is to create a level playing field, so that blockchain applica-
tion can be integrated into existing markets. The long-term outcome could be that 
supervision becomes much more effective, because the transparency of the block-
chain could provide supervisors and courts with access to real-time information. 
This access would also make it easier to develop valuable early-warning systems.Chapter 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Hype or Transformational Technologies? ● 47
The many experiments and brainstorms by governments and central banks 
throughout the region are inspiring. Just as blockchain opportunities put com-
petitive pressure on private financial sectors, they also trigger creative thinking 
in governments. It is important that these experiments not consider current 
blockchain designs as the full universe of possibilities. Even if decentralized 
maintenance of digital government data can have major advantages, a permis -
sioned system seems much more appropriate and efficient for governments than 
the original system that maintains the blockchain for cryptocurrencies. The ulti-
mate conclusion might even be that other data systems are better suited for spe-
cific applications than blockchain technologies, including in the creation of digi-
tal currencies by central banks (box 2.4). The flurry of experiments shows the 
success of the blockchain revolution, but it also illustrates that progress may 
come from innovations that are quite different from the original design and objec-
tive of the blockchain protocol. 
Will central banks issue digital currencies?
 BOX 2.4
Central banks are exploring the possibility of issu -
ing digital money, for several reasons. First, the 
use of traditional cash is steadily declining (Rogoff 
2014). Second, cryptocurrencies have provided a 
working digital alternative to cash, replicating the 
original characteristics of cash in digital format. 
Like cash, cryptocurrencies allow anonymous P2P 
transactions without involvement of middlemen. 
Third, demand for tokens that are linked to legal 
tender is increasing. These tokens could be used in 
the same way as cryptocurrencies but without the 
drawback of high volatility in their value. It seems a 
natural development to transform actual coins and 
banknotes into digital tokens with the same legal 
protection and subject to the same price stabili -
zation as all money issued by central banks.a The 
transparency of transactions with central bank digi -
tal currencies could facilitate the systematic con -
duct of monetary policy (Bordo and Levin 2017).
There are serious concerns about the issuance 
of digital money by central banks. Digital tokens 
issued by central banks could potentially replace 
not only cash but also electronic payment systems 
operated by commercial banks, which already offer 
electronic accounts, mobile money, and value cards. 
These systems can be uploaded and used offline. The Swedish central bank is exploring the pos -
sibility of making electronic accounts and value 
cards directly available to the public. The idea is to 
administer this digital money in a central register at 
the central bank. This proposal to replicate instru -
ments that already exist in the private sector stems 
from the understanding that the government has 
the legal obligation to provide means of payment 
to the public. It could, however, undercut the tra -
ditional financial intermediation role of commercial 
banks, which transform liquid liabilities into long-
term assets. A central bank cannot take over the 
role of pooling liquidity to finance investments. 
If a central bank chose blockchain technolo -
gies to administer digital transactions in a decen -
tralized way, it would compete more directly with 
cryptocurrencies, with the advantage of providing 
a token with a more stable value. Still, the system 
would differ fundamentally from the early crypto -
currency protocols. Supply of central bank coins 
would be endogenous—in order to link their value 
to legal tender—and seigniorage would accrue to 
the central bank. Such a system would undoubt -
edly become a permissioned blockchain, with only 
preselected servers participating (Danezis and 
Meiklejohn 2016). 
a. Bech and Garratt (2017) provides a comprehensive overview of the differences between central bank digital currencies and 
cryptocurrencies.48 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update May 2018
Notes
1.  Electronic accounts are much more popular than cash. Central banks do provide elec-
tronic accounts to banks; they do not yet provide digital cash or electronic accounts di-
rectly to the public.
2.  The public key functions as a pseudonym in communications. The private key is used 
to prove one’s identity. If this digital ID becomes a standard on open-source platforms, it 
could make IDs and passwords on proprietary platforms like Facebook or Google redun-
dant.
3.  See, for example, the Georgian start-up Golden Fleece (https://goldenfleece.co/).
4.  Clark (2017) describes the early history of digital payment systems. 
5.  A bitcoin address is an identifier of 26–35 alphanumeric characters that are equivalent to 
unique IDs. Every transaction is recorded on the public blockchain, so anyone can view 
each address involved in each transaction. However, it is difficult to know the real iden-
tity of the people involved in the transactions. For this reason, the bitcoin network is of-
ten described as being pseudo-anonymous rather than completely anonymous. 
6.  In the bitcoin protocol, a block can contain about 2,000 new transactions.
7.  The block rewards are hard-coded, but there is no guidance on what the fee should be. 
As miners have discretion over which transactions to include, they select the transactions 
with the highest fees. As the size of each block on the blockchain is limited to 1 MB 
(roughly 2,000 transactions), if a user wants her transaction to be included in the next

etary instruments).

Albania’s real GDP grew by 3.8 percent 
in 2017, up from 3.4 percent in 2016. Key 
drivers were private investment and con-
sumption. Investment dynamics reflected 
two large energy projects financed by 
FDI (the Trans - Adriatic Pipeline and a 
hydropower plant). Private consumption 
was supported by a recovery in employ-
ment, wages and credit. Public consump-
tion made a small contribution to 
growth, reflecting growth of the public -
sector wages. High tourism exports and 
recovering commodity exports more than 
compensated for the high investment -
related imports of machineries and 
equipment as well as for the drought -
related energy imports.  
Growth stimulated job creation. Employ-
ment grew by 2.9 percent in the first three 
quarters of 2017, following a strong ex-
pansion of 6.5 percent in 2016. Labor force 
participation increased to 58 percent, up 
by 0.4 percentage points year -on-year. 
Besides improved employment prospects, 
the increase in labor force participation 
may reflect the Government ’s anti -
informality campaign – including in-
creased audits and higher penalties for 
non-compliance. The unemployment rate 
declined by 1.7 pp to an average of 13.9 
percent in the first three quarters of 2017. 
Real wages in the formal employment 
have started to pick up in 2017 in con-
struction, energy, and tourism.  
Poverty is estimated to have declined as 
growth and employment continued to pick up. The poverty rate (measured as 
US$ 5.5/day, 2011 PPP) is estimated to 
have decreased in 2017 to 32.8 percent, 
compared to 33.9 percent in 2016. Labor 
force participation of women, particularly 
young women, has started to decline 
throughout 2017, a trend that needs to be 
closely monitored to avoid reversing pre-
vious gains.  
Fiscal policy supported a reduction of 
public debt, but the pace of fiscal consoli-
dation slowed in 2017. The 2017 fiscal defi-
cit is estimated at 2 percent of GDP, slight-
ly above the deficit of 1.8 percent in 2016. 
Revenue gains, from increased economic 
activity and the recovery of commodity 
prices, were estimated at an additional 0.9 
percent of GDP in comparison to 2016. On 
the expenditure side, under -execution of 
public investments and lower interest 
expenditures partially compensated 
drought -related emergency support to the 
electricity sector and higher local govern-
ments spending. Prudent fiscal policy 
supported the public debt decline to 71 
percent of GDP in 2017, compared to 72.4 
percent in 2016.  
The Bank of Albania ’s (BoA) policy stance 
continues to be accommodative and credit 
growth recovers. Average inflation picked 
up to 2 percent in 2017, but remained be-
low the BoA ’s 3 percent target, prompting 
no changes in the policy rate, which re-
mains at 1.25 percent since May 2016. Un-
derlying price pressures have remained 
subdued, helped by an appreciation of the 
national currency relative to the euro by 1.7 
percent in 2017. The restructuring of NPLs 
from large borrowers and mandatory write
-offs led to a decline in the NPL ratio to 13.2 ALBANIA

Sources: Instat, Bank staff calculations.  Sources: World Bank. Notes: See Table 2.  Growth is estimated to have strengthened 
at 3.8 percent in 2017 supported by in-
vestments and is projected to moderate to 
3.6 percent in 2018 as large FDI -financed 
energy projects wind down; growth will 
be driven by household consumption, and 
a pickup in exports. Growth created jobs, 
contributing to poverty reduction. Public 
debt declined in 2017, but the pace of 
fiscal consolidation slowed. Fiscal consol-
idation, improvement in spending effi-
ciency, and implementation of structural 
reforms remain critical to fostering confi-
dence and growth.  Table 1 2017

Low interest rates, progress in dealing with 
NPLs and economic growth stimulated an 
increase of private sector credit issuance by 
13.5 percent in 2017.  
The current account deficit widened in 
2017. The current account deficit is esti-
mated to have widened, reaching 8 per-
cent of GDP in 2017. FDI -related invest-
ments in the energy sector and drought -
related electricity imports increased im-
ports. Tourism and commodity prices 
increased the value of exports. The result-
ing financing needs were covered by sig-
nificant FDI inflows. With much of the 
financing coming through FDIs, external 
debt declined by 2 percentage points 
reaching 70.4 percent of GDP in 2017. For-
eign exchange reserves have remained 
stable, covering 6 ½ months of imports of 
goods and services.  
 
 
Outlook 
 
Growth is projected to moderate to 3.6 
percent in 2018, as two large FDI projects 
in the energy sector wind down, and then 
average 3.5 percent in the period 2019 -20. 
As the demand stimulus from the large energy FDI projects winds down and eco-
nomic activity increases to close to poten-
tial, growth will moderate. Growth will be 
increasingly relying on private consump-
tion, supported by improved labor market 
conditions, and net exports supported by 
improved foreign demand. Investment 
will continue to support growth, reflecting 
a public investment drive to reduce infra-
structure gaps and private investment, 
reflecting structural reforms and improve-
ments in the business climate. Labor mar-
ket improvements will support private 
consumption. Poverty is expected to de-
cline from 31.3 percent in 2018 to 29.5 per-
cent in 2019.  
Sustained fiscal consolidation and struc-
tural reforms are expected to gradually 
reduce the fiscal deficit to 1.5 percent of 
GDP by 2020, and the debt -to-GDP ratio 
to 60 percent of GDP by 2022. Under the 
Government medium term fiscal frame-
work, fiscal consolidation will continue 
until 2021 – lowering expenditures on 
personnel, operational and maintenance, 
social outlays and local governments. On 
the revenue side, the introduction of a 
newly valued property tax in 2018 is ex-
pected to yield additional revenues. While 
the government is planning sustained 
capital expenditures at 5 percent of GDP over the medium term, it has also an-
nounced sizable investments financed 
through public private partnerships 
(PPPs) to be contracted starting from 2018.  
  
 
Risks and challenges  
 
Economic prospects are vulnerable to 
downside risks. Given high public debt, 
the government needs to implement fiscal 
consolidation and strengthen tax compli-
ance to preserve the macro -fiscal stability 
as a foundation for growth. The Govern-
ment needs to strengthen its PPP manage-
ment framework to contain fiscal risks 
from PPPs and to ensure that investment 
is cost -effective. Harnessing growth will 
require progress on structural reforms 
improving the business climate - includ-
ing judiciary, financial and energy reform 
-, strengthening the skills of its labor force 
- and removing barriers to jobs for the 
population. Lower than expected growth 
in trading partners and higher global in-
terest rates are also key risks for Albania ’s 
growth and public finances. Reforms 
should be informed by equity considera-
tions to ensure continued poverty reduc-
tion and inclusion.

42 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
Armenia's economic performance outper-
formed expectations in 2017, recording the 
highest rate of growth since 2007. Follow-
ing a flat economic performance in 2016, 
real GDP expanded by 7.5 percent, mainly 
driven by a recovery in the external envi-
ronment.  Growth was also supported by 
a strong rebound in domestic demand. 
Consumption benefited from higher in-
comes —buoyed by a boost to remittance 
inflows of about 12 percent year on year 
and nominal average wage growth of 3 
percent —which also benefited poor and 
vulnerable households.  
On the production side, growth was driv-
en by a significant expansion in trade (16 
percent), industry (10 percent) and ser-
vices (9 percent). Also the construction 
sector showed modest growth (3 percent), 
but output remains below its pre -crisis 
level of 2008. The agriculture sector 
shrunk (by 4 percent), due to unfavorable 
weather conditions.  
A period of deflation came to an end in 
2017 and inflation began rising, reaching 
an annual rate of 2.6 percent by year -end, 
within the central bank's inflation target of 
4 percent (+/ - 1.5 percentage points). Re-
covering domestic demand, gradually 
rising commodity prices and excise tax 
hikes resulted in higher prices for food, 
beverages, cigarettes, and transport, 
affecting the purchasing power of poor 
and vulnerable groups, which traditional-
ly spend a higher share of their budget on 
these items.  The fiscal deficit narrowed slightly in 
2017, to 4.7 percent of GDP (down from 
5.5 percent in 2016), but remained wider 
than the budgeted deficit of 2.8 percent of 
GDP. While tax revenue increased by 7.3 
percent year on year in 2017 —driven by 
higher collections of excise taxes, customs 
duties and environmental taxes —as a per-
centage of GDP revenue declined by 0.8 
percentage points compared with 2016. 
Capital expenditure rose by 36 percent 
year on year in nominal terms, but tight 
control over current spending resulted in 
a decline of 1.6 percentage points in over-
all expenditure as a share of GDP. At the 
end of 2017, public debt (including CBA 
debt) totaled almost 59 percent of GDP.  
The current account deficit continued to 
narrow for a third consecutive year and is 
estimated to have fallen to under 2 per-
cent of GDP in 2017. The improvement in 
the current account was driven by a 
strong increase in export earnings (up 25 
percent year on year) —particularly from 
minerals and processed food products —
robust growth in tourist arrivals and ex-
ports of other services (such as ICT), and 
improvement in the income account. The 
strong inflows were partially offset by a 
significant increase in import spending 
(28 percent year on year), a large share of 
which comprised capital imports linked 
to investment.  
Banking sector performance remained 
solid, with a capital adequacy ratio of just 
under 20 percent on average at end -2017, 
well above the minimum requirement of 
12 percent. At the end of 2017, the non -
performing loan ratio stood at 5.5 percent, 
its lowest level since the 2014 Russian Table 1 2017

domestic demand supported a real GDP 
growth rate of 7.5 percent in 2017, the 
largest annual expansion in a decade. 
Growth in the medium term is projected 
to converge towards its potential of 
around 4 percent, accompanied by a con-
tinued (albeit gradual) decline in the pov-
erty rate. However, external vulnerabili-
ties and delayed structural reforms could 
undermine economic growth.

over the course of 2017.  
The economic recovery in 2017 is expected 
to have supported a further reduction in 
poverty rates, which have been on a de-
clining trend since the global economic 
crisis. The absolute poverty rate 
(measured at the 2011 PPP -adjusted 
US$3.2/day poverty line) is estimated to 
have fallen from 14.1 percent in 2016 to 
11.6 percent in 2017.  
 
 
Outlook 
 
Armenia's economic outlook remains pos-
itive. The strong performance in 2017 sug-
gests the opening of a window of oppor-
tunity to undertake the reforms needed to 
make growth inclusive and sustainable. 
On the assumption of sustained favorable 
external economic conditions and robust 
structural reforms, medium -term growth 
is forecast to be around the potential 
growth rate (4 percent), supported by pri-
vate-sector, export -led activity. In particu-
lar, the agribusiness, information and communication technology (ICT), and 
tourism sectors are expected to deliver 
solid growth as efforts to boost competi-
tiveness and connectivity start to deliver 
results. As the economy continues to grow 
and incomes rise —and remittance inflows 
continue to support livelihoods thanks to 
a benign external environment —the abso-
lute poverty rate is forecast to decline to 
8.1 percent in 2020.  
Although price pressures are forecast to 
increase in the short term, mainly due to 
higher customs duties and excise taxes on 
fuels starting in 2018, inflation is projected 
to remain within the official target range.  
The new Tax Code, which becomes fully 
effective in 2018, lays the foundation for 
better tax administration and higher tax 
revenues. Implementation of the upgrad-
ed fiscal rule (approved in December 
2017) will result in stronger discipline for 
current spending and will provide some 
room to increase growth -friendly capital 
expenditures while also stabilizing and 
eventually reducing the public debt.  
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
Armenia ’s vulnerability to economic con-
ditions in Russia and its other trading partners —as well as its low level of ex-
port diversification —will remain high. 
Adverse shocks linked to the Russian 
recovery or metal export prices would 
have a negative impact on economic 
growth rates over the near to medium 
term. Fiscal slippage could trigger the 
need for sharper adjustments in public 
spending, undermining domestic demand 
and real economic activity. Fiscal policy 
should remain prudent to contain public 
debt levels. Avoiding fiscal procyclicality 
will help prevent macroeconomic imbal-
ances and reduce the risks associated 
with overheating (including potential 
competitiveness losses) during periods of 
strong economic growth. Continuing co-
ordination with the monetary authorities 
and the maintenance of a flexible ex-
change rate will be vital to avoid episodes 
of real exchange rate appreciation that 
can lead to losses in competitiveness.  
Sustaining robust economic growth will 
require bold structural reforms —such as 
providing a fair and competitive business 
and investment environment —to address 
fundamental problems in Armenia's econ-
omy. Increasing country-wide access to 
economic opportunities will help to boost 
household incomes and drive a further 
reduction in poverty, particularly in sec-
ondary cities where poverty is highest.

44 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
The Azerbaijani economy had a very mod-
est recovery in 2017, as a rebound in the 
non-oil economy was offset by a contrac-
tion in the oil sector due to substantial 
OPEC-led cuts in oil production and ca-
pacity constraints. In particular, the non -
oil sector rebounded by 2.7 percent year -
on-year (y/y), supported by benign public 
financing, stronger external demand, and 
improved confidence in response to recov-
ering oil prices. With the exception of the 
construction sector, output increased in all 
non-oil sectors with strong y/y growth 
recorded in transport (8.5 percent), infor-
mation and communication technologies 
(6.6 percent), tourism (5.9 percent) and 
agriculture (4.2 percent).  On the down-
side, and despite higher oil prices, oil GDP 
contracted by 5 percent y/y.  
Annual end -year inflation declined from 
15.6 percent in 2016 to 7.9 percent in 2017, 
as the effect of the exchange rate pass -
through and the impact of administrative 
tariffs dissipated. The high inflation rate 
recorded for food items (9.4 percent y/y) 
was due to a strong external demand for 
agricultural products. To curb inflation, 
the central bank continued to tighten the 
monetary policy stance by actively absorb-
ing manat liquidity through the use of 
deposit auction operations and the issu-
ance of notes.  
Higher oil prices, sluggish import growth, 
and expanded non -oil exports helped to 
improve Azerbaijan ’s balance of payments 
in 2017. Exports expanded by 50 percent y/y, led by a rise in oil exports, as oil pric-
es recovered (oil exports accounted for 90 
percent of total exports), while imports 
rebounded by 3 percent y/y (compared to 
a drop in 2016). Non -oil exports increased 
by 22 percent y/y, supported by stronger 
external demand, mainly from Russia. The 
current account recorded an estimated 
surplus of 4.3 percent of GDP in 2017.  
The tightening monetary policy, improved 
external environment, and transfers from 
the Oil Fund to the central bank helped to 
maintain a broadly stable exchange rate at 
1.7 AZN per USD in 2017. As a result, the 
central bank ’s reserves increased by 34 
percent y/y in 2017 and totaled US$5.3 
billion by end -2017. The Oil Fund ’s assets 
rose by 8.02 percent y/y and totaled US$ 
35.8 billion (about 87% of GDP) in January 
2018, mainly due to higher oil prices and a 
portfolio revaluation.  
In June 2017, the Government of Azerbai-
jan (GoA) relaxed its fiscal consolidation 
program, and public spending was re-
vised up to primarily inject capital equiva-
lent to 0.7 percent of GDP in the Azerbai-
jan Deposit Insurance Fund1. Higher 
budget spending is estimated to have wid-
ened the consolidated fiscal deficit 
(comprising State Budget, the Oil Fund, 
the Social Protection Fund and the Na-
khchivan Government) from a nearly bal-
anced position in 2016 to a deficit of 1.5 
percent of GDP in 2017.  
There were signs of recovery in Azerbai-
jan’s financial sector in 2017, supported by 
the stabilization of the manat exchange 
rate and growth across the non -oil sectors. 
The level of non -performing loans is re-
ported to have dropped from 33 percent AZERBAIJAN

Notes: The official national poverty rates for 2013 -16 have not been reviewed by 
the World Bank.  Azerbaijan ’s economy had a very modest 
recovery in 2017. Benign public financ-
ing, improved confidence, and a favorable 
external environment supported non -oil 
economic growth, but this was offset by 
an OPEC -led decline in oil production. 
Going forward, growth is expected to 
strengthen, driven mainly by a fiscal 
stimulus, a rise in hydrocarbon prices, 
and an increase in gas exports. Social 
conditions remain a major source of con-
cern, as real wages and spending on social 
protection programs declined in 2017.  Table 1 2017

45 MPO  Apr 18  in 1Q2016 to 19 percent in 4Q2017, thanks 
to the restructuring (largely at fiscal cost). 
The restructuring of the largest bank — 
the state -owned International Bank of 
Azerbaijan (IBA) —was completed. IBA ’s 
external liabilities worth US$3.3 billion 
were converted into longer -term liabilities 
and the sovereign debt.  
High inflation adversely affected house-
hold incomes and reduced the real pur-
chasing power. In 2017, the increase in the 
minimal cost of living and nominal aver-
age wages by 11.6 percent y/y and 6 per-
cent y/y, respectively, was not sufficient to 
compensate for higher prices. As a result, 
poverty likely increased in 2017 and was 
probably worsened by the 50 -percent cut 
in the coverage of the country ’s most im-
portant social assistance program.  
 
 
Outlook 
 
Azerbaijan ’s economy is projected to ex-
pand by 1.8 percent y/y in 2018, support-
ed mainly by the fiscal stimulus. The 
growth is expected to accelerate in the 
medium term, driven by an expansion of 
natural gas production, as the main pipe-
line that will deliver gas to Europe from the Shah -Deniz II field will be operational 
by end -2018. Since the OPEC -deal is ex-
tended until the end of 2018, Azerbaijan ’s 
crude oil output is not expected to decline 
much further. Moreover, average oil pric-
es will firm up somewhat in 2018 relative 
to 2017 and are projected to stabilize at 
robust levels in the medium term. Non -oil 
GDP growth is expected to accelerate in 
2018, fueled by an 83 -percent y/y increase 
in budgeted public investment. Neverthe-
less, growth in the non -oil economy is 
expected to remain moderate due to a 
protracted recovery of the banking sector 
and a weak business environment.  
The GoA plans a fiscal stimulus in 2018 
through boosting capital spending, which 
will be primarily financed by an increase 
in budget transfers from the sovereign 
wealth fund. The consolidated fiscal bal-
ance is likely to be slightly positive in 2018 
and is estimated to average 1.3 percent of 
GDP in the medium term, as oil prices 
remain firm and gas exports rise.  
To contain inflation, the central bank 
needs to continue tightening monetary 
policy. Azerbaijan ’s external sector is ex-
pected to continue to improve due to an 
increase in hydrocarbon production and a 
continuation of non -oil export growth, 
supported by a rise in external demand and enhanced government support to 
exporters of non -oil products. However, 
spending cuts on social protection, as well 
as a moderate economic recovery, are not 
conducive to poverty reduction.  
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
Following the recovery in oil prices after 
the 2014 -16 shock, the likelihood of a pro -
cyclical economic policy rather than eco-
nomic reforms to stimulate growth is ris-
ing. The main challenge is to preserve the 
reform momentum induced by the shock 
and strengthen institutions to ensure the 
resilience of the economy to future exter-
nal shocks. Moreover, progress on the 
structural reform agenda to stimulate pri-
vate-sector participation and jobs creation 
remains limited. An adaptive and effective 
social protection system and programs 
aimed at productive inclusion of poor and 
vulnerable households are needed to re-
duce poverty.

46 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
The modest cyclical expansion continues, 
supported by improving external condi-
tions and recovery in industry. In 2017, 
the economy grew at 2.4  percent y/y, a 
rebound from the contraction of 
2.5 percent y/y in 2016. Modest economic 
growth in Russia and a gradual increase 
in commodity prices boosted merchandize 
exports and supported an increase in do-
mestic business activity. On the demand 
side, real wage increases helped to in-
crease household consumption by almost 
6 percent in 3Q 2017 (vs. 6.5  percent fall in 
3Q 2016). In the same period, growth of 
gross fixed capital formation recovered to 
1.8 percent – mainly due to rebound of 
public investment – versus the dramatic 
fall by 18.9  percent in 3Q 2016. 
In 2017, annual average inflation slowed 
to 4.6  percent helped by better anchored 
inflation expectations, moderation in ad-
ministrative price adjustments, and im-
ported disinflation. Moderating inflation 
has allowed the National Bank to cut its 
benchmark rate from 17 to 10.5  percent 
during 2017, leading to an almost twofold 
reduction in nominal lending rates in na-
tional currency. As a result, supply of new 
credit in nominal terms went up by almost 
30 percent y/y. However, NPL levels re-
main at around 13  percent and a compre-
hensive NPL resolution mechanism is still 
not put in place.  
Quasi -fiscal expenditures continue to put 
pressures on public debt levels and exter-
nal financing needs. Recorded primary budget surplus has been spent on repay-
ment and servicing public debt in foreign 
currency, which amounted to 
US$3.26  billion, or 6.9 percent of GDP. 
Pressures were partially eased by the dis-
bursement of the two tranches of the 
EFSD loan (totaling US$600 million), dis-
bursement of a bilateral loan from Russia 
(US$700 million), and the issuance of Eu-
robonds —US$1.4  billion in 2017, and 
US$0.6 billion in February 2018. Exports 
recovered, helping to bring down the cur-
rent account deficit to 1.1  percent of GDP 
in January -November 2017 (vs 3.2  percent 
a year ago), yet driven by the primary 
income deficit of 4  percent of GDP.  
Real wage increases have stopped the 
deterioration of household incomes. In 
2017, real wages and disposable incomes 
grew by 6.2 and 2.4  percent respectively, 
benefiting from lower inflation. Disposa-
ble incomes growth was the highest in 
Minsk, but also in regions with higher 
absolute poverty rates, such as Brest and 
Gomel. The hires -to-terminations ratio 
throughout 2017 exceeded that of 2016 by 
an average of 12  percent. The share of 
households below the official poverty 
threshold remained stable throughout the 
first three quarters of 2017.  
 
 
Outlook  
 
While the recovery is underway, annual 
economic growth rates are unlikely to ex-
ceed 3 percent. Improved household con-
sumption and investment activity, along 
with gradual increase in exports, will help BELARUS

domestic demand, and prudent macroeco-
nomic policies supported a cyclical recov-
ery in 2017 and early 2018. Real incomes 
started to pick up, but accelerated wage 
growth, along with other fiscal stimulus, 
could pose risks to macro stability. Rising 
public debt levels and continued depend-
ence on external financing make the econ-
omy vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks. 
The revival of economic growth requires

ing productivity improvements.  Table 1 2017

47 MPO  Apr 18  the economy to grow. At the same time, 
persisting domestic structural bottlenecks 
related to unaddressed legacy issues of 
misallocation of capital and low export 
diversification will continue to constrain 
the growth potential. Weak foundations 
for a sustainable growth recovery imply 
that income per capita gaps between Bela-
rus and its neighbors may widen as the 
economies of the Baltic States and Poland 
are projected to grow on average above 
3 percent per annum. At the same time, 
modest growth would ease balance -of-
payment pressures, allowing to maintain a 
current account deficit between 2 and 
3percent of GDP over the next three years.  
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
Downside risks from external factors are 
coming from two sources. First, although 
the headline current account deficits have 
narrowed down, a public debt to GDP ratio is likely to remain close to a half of GDP in 
the medium term. Majority of gross exter-
nal debt pertains to the public sector and is 
characterized by a heavy and uneven debt 
service profile with repayment peaks every 
few years. As the public debt is largely 
denominated in foreign currency, there is a 
risk of disorderly adjustment in external 
imbalance due to tightening of global fi-
nancial conditions. Second, Belarus re-
mains vulnerable to changes in global com-
modity prices and in terms of its energy 
trade policy with Russia.  
Either of these developments would make 
it harder for the government to generate 
the foreign currency needed to service its 
debt. Belarus ’s experience with the 2017 
Eurobond issuance indicates that access to 
external market financing – in contrast to 
loans from Russia and China – comes at a 
high cost. A ten -year, US$0.6 billion 
tranche was priced at 7.625 percent, high-
er rates than the ones obtained by emerg-
ing economies. In 2018, the Government 
will allocate US$3.1 billion for external public debt repayments and service (or 
about 5.4 percent of forecasted GDP), 
while domestic obligations of the Govern-
ment denominated in foreign currency 
add another US$0.7 billion (or about 1.2 
percent of GDP).  
Downside risks from domestic factors 
relate to a possibility of a disorderly un-
winding of financial sector imbalances if 
mechanisms for addressing insolvent 
SOEs and NPL resolution are not put in 
place. In addition, there are risks to fiscal 
sustainability arising from existing quasi -
fiscal deficits related to the excesses of the 
expansionary policies of the past. Reintro-
duction of short -term demand stimulus is 
risky, leaving little prospects for improv-
ing enterprise performance and strength-
ening of financing sector. The effects of 
lower interest rates are limited, as highly 
indebted enterprises are unable to invest 
more. Boosting productivity of available 
capital and labor remains a sustainable 
way to overcome prolonged stagnation of 
growth and incomes.

ports 5.1pp. Improved external demand 
has supported exports growth, but   a 
strong rise in imports is offsetting this 
momentum. With negative overall net 
exports, they are estimated to have sub-
tracted from growth ( -0.8 pp).   Unem-
ployment remains high, although some 
improvements are observed in the labor 
market. The unemployment rate fell from 
25.4 percent in 2016 to 20.5 in 2017, driven 
by a fall in activity rate and a slight rise in 
employment. The decrease in unemploy-
ment was more pronounced among work-
ers with primary education (from 26 per-
cent in 2016 to 18 percent in 2017), which 
should have made poverty recede in 2017.  
After almost two years of deflation, infla-
tion started to pick up in 2017, owing 
mainly to the recovery of global oil price. 
The consumer price index increased by 
1.2 percent year -on-year (y -o-y) in De-
cember 2017. The biggest driver of the 
increase was transport, tobacco and rental 
housing. In contrast, prices decreased 
notably on alcohol, clothing, and telecom-
munication services. Given similar 
growth in nominal salaries, the effect on 
real incomes was neutral.  
In 2017, the fiscal balance is expected to 
remain in surplus. The latest consolidated 
data project a 2.0 percent of GDP surplus 
in 2017, up from a deficit of 0.3 percent in 2016. In 2017, revenues rose mainly due 
to stronger collection of indirect taxes 
while expenditure declined mainly be-
cause of continued restraint on current 
government spending. At the same time, 
sluggish capital spending reflected imple-
mentation delays.  
Current expenditures are expected to re-
main on a downward, driven by the com-
mitment of the authorities to reduce the 
wage bill. Total public debt in 2017 re-
mained at 37 percent of GDP (external 
public debt was 27 percent of GDP) and 
consisted largely of concessional debt to 
international financial institutions.  
The latest available poverty data using the 
national poverty line is for 2015 and was 
estimated at 16 percent, very close to the 
15 percent poverty rate estimated for 2011. 
Rural poverty (19 percent) was higher 
than urban poverty (12 percent). Behind 
the minimal movement in poverty in 2011
-2015 there was a small positive effect of 
pensions on household incomes, coun-
tered mainly by a decrease in employment 
rate and a decline in self -employment 
earnings. The implementation of new la-
bor laws in both BiH entities, and continu-
ation of support schemes for first -time job 
seekers are expected to improve labor 
markets outcomes in the coming years, 
hence also supporting poverty reduction.  
 
 
Outlook  
 
Supported primarily by consumption and 
to some extent by public investment, eco-
nomic growth is projected to strengthen to BOSNIA AND 
HERZEGOVINA

3 percent in 2017, is expected to pick -up 
starting in 2018 with the implementation 
of structural reforms and heavy infra-
structure investment. Translating this 
growth into improvements in labor mar-
kets will be critical to observe declines in 
poverty. As BiH enters general elections 
year, political turmoil may be a risk for 
economic growth.  Table 1 2017

49 MPO  Apr 18  about 4 percent by 2020. As the BiH ’s re-
form agenda advances, a moderate rise in 
exports is expected, but strong demand 
for imports implies that net external de-
mand will continue to be a drag on 
growth. Remittances are likely to remain 
stable, and, together with progress on 
reforms, will underpin a gradual pickup 
in consumption, which will remain a ma-
jor driver of growth. Investments in ener-
gy, construction, and tourism will support 
investment growth generally, as well as 
job creation in those sectors. Because of 
these dynamics, real GDP growth is pro-
jected to build up gradually from 3 per-
cent in 2017 to 3.2 percent in 2018 and up 
to 4 percent in 2020.  
As poverty is strongly associated with 
unemployment and inactivity in BiH, for 
economic growth to translate into pov-
erty reduction, improvements in labor 
market participation and employment 
will remain key. However, with high 
unemployment and the expectations of 
flat real wages due to the substantial 
remaining slack in the labor market , poverty is  projected to decline only slow-
ly over the next couple of years.  
The current account deficit (CAD) is fore-
cast to rise slightly in 2018 as both imports 
and exports started to pick up in 2017. In 
the medium run, with improved progress 
on ongoing structural reforms and higher 
demand for foreign savings, CAD is ex-
pected to deteriorate from 5.8 percent of 
GDP in 2017 to 6.8 percent of GDP by 
2020. Overall, in the medium term both 
fiscal and external deficits will persist un-
til 2020.  
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
Achieving prudent, efficient, and effective 
fiscal policy, addressing persistent unem-
ployment and continuing to safeguard the 
banking sector, will remain central to the 
BiH reform agenda. Although external 
deficits continue to be moderate, on the 
fiscal side the tax burden is high, and pub-
lic spending is inefficient, as evidenced by poorly -targeted benefits. Fiscal consolida-
tion and provision of an effective safety 
net will not be effective if structural rigidi-
ties in spending are not addressed —
especially the high public wage bill. How-
ever, support from the international part-
ners can help the BiH authorities to deliv-
er on their challenging reform agenda. 
Without continued implementation of 
structural reforms, it would be difficult to 
address rigidities in public employment, 
pensions, and debt.  
There are notable risks, both domestic and 
external. The main domestic risk is the 
challenging political environment, which 
makes structural reforms difficult in such 
areas as infrastructure, telecommunica-
tions, energy sector, and transport. It also 
raises risks to the economic outlook. De-
spite some delays, BiH has submitted a 
detailed Questionnaire to the European 
Commission, a major step towards becom-
ing a candidate country. Main external 
risk for BiH remains slow growth in the 
EU and rising inflation in developed 
countries and interest rates.

50 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
Economic growth remained strong in Bul-
garia at 3.6 percent in 2017, only slightly 
lower than 3.9 percent in 2016. Consump-
tion and investment were the main drivers 
of growth while the contribution of net 
exports was negative in 2017. Consump-
tion was supported by a dynamic labor 
market, rising wages, and eased financial 
credit  conditions.  Investment expanded at 
a solid rate, despite slow implementation 
of public investment projects. On the pro-
duction side, the greatest contributions to 
GDP growth came from manufacturing; 
construction; real estate; trade, transport, 
and tourism.  
Strong domestic demand and higher ener-
gy and commodity prices pushed inflation 
up. After three years of deflation, inflation 
turned positive to 2.1 percent in 2017.  
Fiscal performance remained positive on 
the back of improved revenue collection 
and lower than planned public investment 
spending. Tax revenues grew by 10 per-
cent in 2017 compared with 2016 thanks to 
strong economic activity, better compli-
ance, higher minimum wages and an in-
crease in the pension contribution rate. 
Like 2016, capital investment was well 
below expectations as implementation of 
EU funded projects remained slow. In-
stead of planned deficit of 0.6 percent of 
GDP, fiscal accounts were balanced for the 
second year in a row.  
The current account surplus narrowed 
to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2017 com-
pared with 5.3 percent in 2016 follow-ing the  deterioration of the trade bal-
ance and lower EU transfers.  
At 72.1 percent, the employment rate (20 -
64) reached record high levels while unem-
ployment was close to pre -crisis levels. 
However, the working age population 
continued to shrink constraining the ex-
pansion of potential growth. Labor and 
skill shortages as well as rising minimum 
wages pushed overall salaries up about 9 
percent compared with 2016.  
Strong labor market conditions supported 
continued improvement in poverty reduc-
tion. Poverty measured using the Upper 
Middle -Income Class line of $5.5 per day 
(in 2011 PPP terms) is estimated to have 
declined from 8.5 percent in 2015 to 7.5 
percent in 2017 (see Notes to Table 2). 
However, income inequality in Bulgaria is 
the highest in the EU and has been increas-
ing over the last few years, with the in-
come of the richest 20 percent of the popu-
lation equal to almost eight times that of 
the poorest 20 percent in 2015. The cover-
age and adequacy of the social transfer 
system remains low. Unemployment has 
declined significantly but regional varia-
tions and long -term and youth unemploy-
ment remain high. Inactivity among cer-
tain groups of the population persists and 
many citizens – including the elderly, peo-
ple living in rural areas, and the Roma – 
are excluded from economic opportunities.  
  
 
Outlook  
 
GDP growth is expected to remain robust, 
reaching 3.8 percent in 2018. Domestic  Table 1 2017

2017, slightly lower compared with 2016. 
The employment rate peaked and wages 
were pushed up by labor and skill short-
ages. Output and employment growth 
contributed to a reduction in poverty. 
Further gains in growth, poverty reduc-
tion and shared prosperity hinge on the 
implementation of policies to boost 
productivity. Policy areas that require 
attention include strengthening institu-
tions, enhancing the skills of the labor 
force, and improving the effectiveness  
and efficiency of public spending.

51 MPO  Apr 18  demand will continue to support growth 
as the expected intensified absorption of 
EU funds will boost investment, likely 
outweighing the negative contribution of 
net exports. Private consumption is ex-
pected to continue expanding thanks to 
tight labor markets and rising real estate 
prices in large cities. Going forward, 
GDP growth is projected to moderate to 
3.6 percent in 2019 and 2020. Domestic 
demand should remain the driver of 
growth with an increasing contribution 
of investment.  
The current account balance is likely to 
remain in surplus, but narrow net ex-
ports will continue to deteriorate and an 
expected slowdown in EU growth due to 
higher oil and commodity prices.  
The fiscal position is likely to weaken 
slightly in 2018 and 2019, reflecting plans 
for expansion of public investment and 
increasing wages and social assistance 
payments. Strong revenue collection, driv-
en by further improvements in compli-
ance and an increased pension contribu-
tion rate in 2018, is likely to support fiscal 
consolidation in the medium term. Lack of 
improvement in spending efficiency in health, public order, and infrastructure 
could undermine fiscal consolidation and 
limit the potential of public spending to 
enhance growth.  
Poverty reduction is expected to continue 
at a modest pace in the near term. Sus-
tained improvements in employment and 
wages, as well as recent increases in the 
minimum pension, should support real 
incomes and therefore further reductions 
in poverty. Poverty is projected to fall 
from 7.5 percent in 2017, as measured at 
$5.5 a day in 2011 PPP, to 7.0 percent in 
2018, and to 6.3 percent by 2020.  
 
 
Risks and challenges

broadly balanced. Lower than expected 
European growth could undermine export 
growth, while tightening global financial 
market conditions could increase the cost 
of lending to the private sector with nega-
tive implications for investment. Continued 
wage growth at a faster pace than produc-
tivity could translate into increasing  unit labor costs and therefore undermine com-
petitiveness. Further acceleration of real 
estate prices in large cities could negative-
ly affect the quality of bank portfolios. 
Upside factors likely to lead to higher -
than expected growth are an enhanced 
economic sentiment in Europe and strong-
er global economic activity.  
The key challenges for Bulgaria are to 
accelerate convergence with the rest of the 
EU and to build a more inclusive society. 
Accelerating convergence requires im-
provements in productivity and labor 
force participation as the demographic 
transition is weighing on the size of the 
working age population. Enhancing 
productivity growth requires addressing 
governance challenges (public administra-
tion, judiciary, business environment, 
governance of SOEs) that have under-
mined Bulgaria ’s structural transfor-
mation. Enhancing the skills and employ-
ability of all Bulgarians, more effective 
and efficient public spending on health, 
pensions and long-term care are also 
needed to ensure inclusiveness and sus-
tainability of growth in the face of demo-
graphic changes.

52 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
GDP growth slowed from 3.2 percent in 
2016 to 2.8 percent in 2017. Exports of 
goods and services was the main driver of 
growth in 2017. Tourism recorded excep-
tional performance with foreign tourist 
nights rising by over 11 percent, and 
strong growth of merchandise export con-
tinued. Private consumption also made a 
positive contribution to growth, supported 
by favorable labor market developments 
and personal income tax rate cuts. Howev-
er, the share of imported durable goods in 
consumption increased. On balance, the 
effect of net exports on growth turned neg-
ative. In addition, growth slowed down 
because investment growth decelerated 
markedly. This was mainly due to a weak-
er absorption of EU funds, which led to a 
sharp fall in government investments.  
Following deflationary pressures in 2016, 
prices increased by 1.1 percent y -o-y in 
2017 on the back of the recovery of inter-
national oil and food prices. With inflation 
still subdued, the Croatian National Bank 
(CNB) continued to pursue an expansion-
ary monetary policy throughout 2017.  
Fiscal consolidation also continued in 
2017, with the budget surplus estimated at 
0.1 percent of GDP, down from a deficit of 
0.9 percent in 2016. The surplus was 
achieved by buoyant tax collection and 
constrained growth in expenditures in line 
with the November 2017 budget revision. 
The combination of a significant primary 
surplus and a small debt reducing interest
-rate growth differential resulted in a stronger than expected fall in the govern-
ment’s debt ratio to 80 percent of GDP in 
2017, down from 82.7 in 2016.  
External imbalances narrowed further as 
the current account surplus increased to 
3.7 percent of GDP in September 2017 (on 
a four -quarter basis). This rise is expected 
to be only temporary, as it reflects a fall in 
banks’ profits resulting from their expo-
sures to Agrokor Group. External debt (of 
the public and private sectors) declined to 
84.2 percent of GDP in November 2017, 
5.6 percent lower than 2016, as banks and 
the private corporate sector continued to 
deleverage.  
 Employment rose across the board, with 
manufacturing, tourism and construction 
accounting for more than a half of the 
increase. Together with negative migra-
tion flows, this led to a marked decline of 
the survey -based unemployment rate to 
an estimated 11 percent in 2017, down 
from 13.1 percent in 2016. Real net wages 
increased by 4.2 percent y -o-y in Decem-
ber. The positive wage trends are due the 
recovery of firms' profitability, labor 
shortages in some sectors, a 6 -percent rise 
in public sector wages and cuts in the per-
sonal income tax rate.  
Economic recovery and labor market 
improvements are now starting to re-
duce absolute poverty, after increasing 
during six subsequent years of economic 
recession. The poverty rate measured at 
the upper middle -income class poverty 
line of $5.5 at 2011 PPP per capita fell 
from 7.3 percent in 2013 to 5.8 percent in 
2015, which is still higher than the pre -
crisis rate. The poverty rate for 2017 is 
projected at 5.1 percent, suggesting that CROATIA

real GDP growth   FIGURE 2  Croatia / Actual and projected poverty rates and 
real GDP per capita  
Sources: CROSTAT, World Bank.   Sources: World Bank (see notes to Table 2).  Economic growth decelerated to 2.8 per-
cent in 2017 due to a slowdown in gov-
ernment investment and a rebound in 
imports. The poverty rate is projected to 
have declined to 5.1 percent as disposable 
incomes have increased. Strong fiscal con-
solidation continued in 2017, leading to a 
further fall in the debt ratio. However, the 
reform momentum has faltered and, with-
out addressing substantial economic and 
institutional weaknesses, prospects for 
reinitiating real convergence and promot-
ing inclusive growth are weak.  Table 1 2017

53 MPO  Apr 18  the reduction in poverty is slowing down.  
While real per capita income has returned 
to its 2008 level, output is still about 4 
percent lower than in 2008. Therefore, the 
rebound in per capita income reflects the 
impact of demographic trends.  
 
 
Outlook 
 
Growth is expected to slow further to 2.6 
percent in 2018, due to a slowdown in 
private consumption as the favorable 
effects of the tax reform on real wages 
start to fade. Furthermore, exports of tour-
ist services are expected to slow in 2018, 
due to capacity constraints. On the other 
hand, better absorption of EU funds will 
give a boost to investment spending. 
These trends suggest an average economic 
growth of 2.8 percent for 2019 and 2020.  
The government balance is expected to 
stay in surplus and may reach 1 percent by 2020, leading to a further decline in public 
debt to below 70 percent of GDP. Howev-
er, the overall fiscal stance will become 
moderately pro -cyclical, as the structural 
budget balance is expected to worsen.  
Positive labor market developments are 
expected to support the growth of dispos-
able income for all segments of the wel-
fare distribution. The continued decline in 
the share of long -term unemployed and 
NEETs will reduce the absolute poverty 
rate further to 4.0 percent in 2020.  
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
Risks are slightly skewed to the downside. 
As the operational restructuring of Agro-
kor Group unfolds in 2018, the negative 
effects on investment activity and private 
consumption might be greater than cur-
rently envisaged. In addition, although 
the positive contribution of exports of goods to GDP growth is expected to stay 
high, it is exposed to the risk of a slow-
down in external demand from the EU. 
Furthermore, the still high level of public 
debt makes Croatia vulnerable to interest 
rate shocks and worsening external fi-
nancing conditions. Finally, the cyclical 
upturn and the sounder fiscal position 
may foster continued complacency. The 
lack of reforms would have an adverse 
effect on growth over the medium term.  
Croatia’s prospects for improving higher 
and more inclusive growth remain weak. 
Currently low potential growth calls for a 
strong structural reform agenda. Substan-
tial economic, social and institutional 
weaknesses should be addressed to boost 
private sector productivity and competi-
tiveness, raise the quality of human and 
physical capital and modernize public 
services. This would lead to increasing 
economic activity and employment, 
which are crucial for a further reduction 
in poverty.

54 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
The economy performed well in 2017. 
GDP growth improved markedly to 5 
percent —from 2.8 percent in 2016 —led by 
an improved external environment. Pru-
dent macro -fiscal policies helped preserve 
fiscal space and supported price stability. 
Inflation spiked to 6.7 percent (eop) in 
2017 in response to higher excise taxes on 
tobacco and fuel, but dropped to below 3 
percent in February 2018. With inflation 
above the ceiling of its target range in 2017 
and rapid credit growth, the NBG in-
creased the policy rate by 0.75 bps to 7.25 
percent over 2017.  
Georgia’s external position improved 
considerably. Export of goods expanded 
by 24 percent on the back of strong de-
mand from Russia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, 
China, and the US; tourism proceeds rose 
by 27 percent; and worker ’s remittances 
increased by 21 percent in 2017. Import 
growth was relatively lower, reflecting 
gradually the firming oil prices. Gross 
FDI inflows increased in 2017 to 12.3 per-
cent of GDP, helping strengthen the inter-
national reserve position, which stood at 
4 months of imports of goods and ser-
vices. Total external debt remained high 
at 112 percent of GDP at the end Septem-
ber 2017.  
Fiscal policy was prudent. Despite elimi-
nating the income tax on reinvested 
profits starting in 2017, revenues in-
creased by 11 percent. To prioritize so-
cial and infrastructure spending, the 
authorities generated savings of about 0.8 percentage points of GDP from re-
duced administrative costs in 2017. This 
helped to scale up public investments to 
8.3 percent of GDP and slightly narrow 
fiscal deficit to 3.8 percent of GDP from 
the 3.9 percent observed in 2016. Georgia ’s 
public debt remained sustainable at 44 
percent of GDP as of end -2017.  
The banking sector is well capitalized, 
profitable and with low non -performing 
loans (NPLs), although structural vulnera-
bilities persist. The sector yielded a return 
on assets of 2.8 percent and a return on 
equity of over 20 percent as of end -2017. 
Also by December 2017, NPLs represented 
only 2.4 percent of gross loans, down from 
3.6 percent as of end -2016. At the same 
time, systemic vulnerabilities persist, in-
cluding the large market concentration by 
the top two banks, the high retail loan 
growth (including by non -bank financial 
institutions), and elevated dollarization, 
against the backdrop of deficient financial 
safety nets. NBG plans to address the 
latter issues with the support from the WB 
and IMF.  
Poverty is estimated to have fallen in 2017, 
driven by an increase of employment op-
portunities related to the expansion of the 
construction and services sectors, resum-
ing the decreasing trend started in 2010 
(and which stalled in 2016). The spike in 
inflation in 2017 may have offset —albeit 
to a minor extent —the positive effect of 
employment on poverty by reducing 
households ’ purchasing power. The most 
recent poverty figures available for the 
country are for the year 2016, when pov-
erty was estimated at 17 percent using the 
lower -middle income.  GEORGIA

  Georgia’s growth accelerated to 5.0 per-
cent in 2017, on the back of an improved 
external environment. In 2018 growth is 
projected at 4.5 percent, led by invest-
ment. The fiscal deficit declined to 3.8 
percent of GDP in 2017, slightly improv-
ing from 2016; while fiscal consolidation 
will continue in 2018, public investment 
is expected to remain robust. Poverty is 
expected to return to its declining trend 
as economic growth recovers and trans-
lates into higher income.

Outlook  
 
Georgia’s growth outlook over the medi-
um term is positive. The more benign ex-
ternal environment should facilitate the 
development of private sector -led export 
sectors, encourage FDI, and support con-
sumption from still robust remittances. A 
steady implementation of the reform pro-
gram will result in a further acceleration 
of growth over the medium term to 5 per-
cent by 2020, particularly by enhancing 
productivity. Inflation is envisaged to 
remain well contained, converging to the  
NBG’s target of 3 percent by year -end 
2018, while the current account deficit 
would narrow to below 9 percent of GDP 
by 2020.  
Considerable consolidation of administra-
tive spending, streamlining of  subsidies 
and a more efficient social safety net will 
help to achieve medium -term fiscal con-
solidation while providing space for capi-
tal spending. Current spending is project-
ed to decline from 24.5 percent of GDP in 
2017 to 23 percent in 2020, primarily by 
containing the wage bill and administra-
tive expenses —which rose steadily and 
steeply for at least 4 years —and better 
targeting of subsidies and social assistance programs. The fiscal deficit of the general 
government will be gradually reduced to 
3.0 percent of GDP by 2020 keeping public 
debt stable. Still, fiscal slippages, or accu-
mulation of new liabilities or materializa-
tion of contingent liabilities may compro-
mise the expected consolidation and result 
in higher debt burden. 
Continuous expansion of the economy in 
upcoming years should lead to more em-
ployment opportunities and further pov-
erty reduction. Employment opportunities 
outside agriculture in rural areas (in par-
ticular) will play a critical role in leading 
to significant reductions in lagging re-
gions. Pensions and social assistance are 
expected to play a much smaller role for 
poverty reduction in upcoming years, in 
contrast to the 2010 -2015 period, given the 
more limited fiscal space.  
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
Georgia’s quasi -fiscal risks emanating 
from the contingent liabilities of the State -
Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are substantial 
and a source of vulnerability. The Fiscal 
Risks Annex to the 2018 Budget Law sug-
gests that the liabilities of the 76 high and 
medium risk SOEs are around 20 percent of GDP. Additional risks stem from con-
tingent liabilities generated by the gov-
ernment ’s Power Purchasing Agreements 
(PPAs). At the end -2017 there were 72 
signed PPAs, in which the state issues 
guarantees to purchase excess electricity 
from operators on a seasonal basis. While 
the fiscal risks of PPAs exist, the needs for 
additional power capacity are also evi-
dent from the consumption growth trend. 
The Government is committed to review 
carefully its decisions going forward, 
ensuring compliance of new PPAs with 
the draft Law on Public Private Partner-
ships that is expected to be approved and 
enacted in 2018.  
As a very open economy, Georgia is vul-
nerable to regional developments given its 
historically high current account deficit, 
and the risks of export demand and re-
mittances shock. The downside risks to 
the baseline scenario are associated with 
further tightening of US monetary policy 
and Lari depreciation; deterioration in the 
external environment (including due to a 
weaker EU outlook) and regional geopo-
litical tensions.  
Rural poverty and high poverty rates in 
lagging regions also remain a challenge. 
Providing employment opportunities and 
raising agricultural productivity will be 
critical to address them.

56 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
Following two years of weak growth, Ka-
zakhstan ’s economy recovered in 2017. 
Real GDP growth accelerated to 4  percent 
in 2017, up from 1.1 percent in 2016. Oil 
production, which rose by 10.5 percent 
year on year in 2017, was the primary 
driver of this improvement. The increase 
in oil output was observed in the oil fields 
that were not covered by the OPEC -led 
cuts in 2017. Together with more favora-
ble terms of trade, it generated positive 
spillover effects to the manufacturing and 
services sectors. While the agriculture 
sector contributed modestly to overall 
growth in 2017, growth of the construction 
sector slowed, largely reflecting the com-
pletion of oil transportation projects.  
On the demand side, growth was driven 
by an improvement of net exports, high-
lighting oil sector expansion and the re-
covery of global oil prices.  
The current account deficit narrowed 
substantially in 2017, to 3 percent of 
GDP (from 6.5  percent in 2016), buoyed 
by more favorable terms of trade. The 
improvement in the current account bal-
ance helped the tenge to strengthen by 
about 10 percent in real terms against 
the U.S. dollar in 2017. On the financing 
side, FDI inflows and foreign borrowing 
by state -owned enterprises were offset 
by short -term capital outflows. The cen-
tral bank reported an increase of assets 
held by residents abroad. As a result, 
gross international reserves of the cen-
tral bank and the government (in the oil fund) declined by nearly US$5 billion (3 
percent of GDP).  
The government continued to consolidate 
its core fiscal accounts, but the overall fiscal 
deficit widened to 7 percent of GDP in 2017 
as a result of the banking sector bailout. 
The government recapitalized the Problem 
Loans Fund with an injection of US$6.5 
billion (about 4 percent of GDP) in 2017 to 
support the recovery of banks ’ balance 
sheets; the central bank provided another 
US$2 billion to support ailing banks.  
The central bank continued to implement 
its inflation targeting policy. As the im-
pact of the 2015 currency depreciation 
eased, consumer price inflation halved 
from an average of 14.6 percent in 2016 to 
7.4 percent in 2017. With inflation easing, 
the central bank cut its policy interest rate 
three times in 2017 and two times in early 
2018. The latest rate cut, in March 2018, 
lowered the policy rate to 9.5  percent.  
The poverty rate (using the $5.5/day inter-
national poverty line) rose from 5.6 per-
cent in 2013 to a peak of 7.9 percent in 
2016; it is estimated to have fallen to 6.9 
percent in 2017. The incidence of poverty 
increased in all regions of Kazakhstan 
between 2014 and 2015, the last year for 
which data are available. Poverty rates in 
the most vulnerable southern regions 
more than doubled during this period, 
jumping from 5.2 percent to 13.9 percent 
in Kyzylorda oblast and from 5 percent to 
12.5 percent in Jambyl oblast.  
Despite the economic recovery and im-
proved consumer confidence, household 
income remained under pressure in 2017, 
as the labor market struggled to recover. 
Real wages and salaries declined by 2.1 KAZAKHSTAN

Sources: Statistical Office of Kazakhstan; World Bank staff estimates.  Sources: World Bank staff estimates.  More favorable terms of trade and in-
creased oil production supported the eco-
nomic recovery and an improvement in 
poverty indicators in Kazakhstan in 2017. 
Over the medium term, the real GDP 
growth rate is expected to hover around 
3 percent, as the oil sector ’s contribution 
to economic growth declines relative to 
2017 (when a structural shift in oil out-
put occurred). Risks to the outlook in-
clude a potential weakening of the exter-
nal environment, a worsening of problems 
in the banking sector, and a missed oppor-
tunity to deepen structural reforms.  Table 1 2017

rose by 2.5 percent year on year in Asta-
na, the capital —and by 1.6 percent and 
1.9 percent in Pavlodar and Kostanay 
oblasts, respectively —these gains were 
more than offset by falling real wages in 
the rest of the country. The official unem-
ployment rate remained unchanged in 
2017 at 4.9 percent.  
 
 
Outlook 
 
As oil output growth stabilizes from 2018 
onward, real GDP growth is expected to 
moderate to an average annual rate of 3 
percent through 2020. Growth in the non -
tradable services sector will be supported 
by stronger domestic demand as real in-
comes of households are expected to start 
recovering. Moreover, the planned addi-
tional investment in oil output expansion 
projects will drive an increase in construc-
tion activity.  
Assuming that there are no external 
shocks and that the authorities continue 
their inflation targeting regime, consumer 
price inflation will stabilize at between 4.3
-5.3 percent in the medium term.  
As oil prices are projected to stabilize 
around US$60 per barrel in 2018 -20, the current account balance and fiscal oil reve-
nue are also expected to level off. The fis-
cal position will improve gradually in the 
wake of fiscal consolidation efforts. The 
government is planning to cut the non -oil 
fiscal deficit from over 13 percent of GDP 
in 2017 to 7 percent by 2020.  
As the economy continues to grow, labor 
income —the primary driver of poverty 
reduction in Kazakhstan —is forecast to 
return to positive real growth. As a result, 
the poverty rate is projected to decline to 5 
percent by 2020.  
The successful implementation of struc-
tural reforms will be required to deliver 
more sustainable and inclusive economic 
growth. The ongoing structural and insti-
tutional reforms (including those under 
the 100 Concrete Steps program and the 
Strategic Plan for Development of Ka-
zakhstan to 2025, as adopted in early 2018) 
should aim to reduce the role of the state 
in the economy and facilitate the develop-
ment of a vibrant, modern and innovative 
tradable non -oil sector. In this context, 
efforts to restructure and privatize state -
owned enterprises would be expected to 
focus on improving the efficiency of pub-
lic administration, reducing fiscal risks, 
and open contestable spaces for the pri-
vate sector to act. Prudent fiscal and mon-
etary policies would support economic and price stability and encourage invest-
ment in the non -oil economy. Higher in-
comes will also have positive spillover 
effects on poverty reduction.  
.  
 
Risks and challenges  
 
Both external and domestic factors present 
risks to Kazakhstan ’s medium-term eco-
nomic outlook. The economy ’s vulnerabil-
ity to external shocks remains the main 
challenge to achieving stable and sustaina-
ble development. External demand from 
China and the Russian Federation, Ka-
zakhstan ’s main trading partners, as well 
as global oil demand and prices will re-
main the key external factors impacting 
Kazakhstan ’s economic performance. Do-
mestic factors include the pace of imple-
mentation of structural and institutional 
reforms, especially in anticipation of a 
political transition over the medium term. 
A potential escalation of problems in the 
banking sector is also a concern. To miti-
gate these risks and facilitate a sizeable 
expansion of the tradable non -oil sector ’s 
role in the economy, the government must 
demonstrate significant improvements to 
the rule of law, the investment climate, 
and the quality of human capital.

Growth reached 4.4 percent in 2017, up 
from 4.1 percent in 2016.  The upturn is 
driven by rise in investment, and recovery in 
exports. Higher private investment was driv-
en by FDI inflows, thanks to higher growth 
in Europe, low interest rates, and a better 
business environment as Kosovo improved 
its rank from 60 to 40 in Doing Business. 
Investment contributed 3pp to economic 
growth, with public investment increasing 
by 5 percent y -o-y. The recovery in goods 
exports was led by a rebound in commodity 
prices with a broad -based increase in vol-
umes of goods exports, albeit from a low 
base, and a surge in the export of services. 
Net exports contributed a 1.1pp while the 
contribution of consumption was only 0.4pp. 
In terms of economic sectors, construction, 
trade, financial and transport were the main 
engine of growth in 2017 with a contribution 
of 2.6 pp. Agriculture remained stagnant, 
whereas industry contributed 0.7pp.  
Consumer price inflation was 1.5 percent 
in 2017 y -o-y, up from 0.3 percent in 2016, 
as prices for fuel, food, tobacco, alcohol, 
and other household items increased add-
ing to the cost of living.  
Higher revenues (up 5.3 percent y -o-y) 
and under -execution of public invest-
ments narrowed the fiscal deficit to 1.4 
percent of GDP in 2017, lower than the 
earlier projected 2 percent of GDP. Indi-
rect tax revenues grew by 6.1 percent 
(VAT by 8.1 percent), while non -tax reve-
nues grew by 5.6 percent y -o-y. Direct tax 
revenues added only 2.5 percent growth, due to a decline in CIT collections by 7 
percent. Spending increased by 5.7 per-
cent, due to a 11.9 percent increase in so-
cial transfers and 5.4 percent increase in 
capital spending. Higher actual costs than 
planned costs for spending on veterans 
benefits exceeded plans due to the delay 
in the implementation of the cap on the 
scheme. In addition, goods and services 
spending rose by 10.7 percent due to early 
elections and creation of two additional 
ministries. Public and publicly guaranteed 
debt remains  on a rising trajectory, reach-
ing 15.8 percent of GDP at end -2017.   
The current account deficit (CAD) improved 
to 5.1 percent of GDP in 2017, from 8.2 per-
cent in 2016, thanks to better external condi-
tions and increase in export volumes. Ex-
ports of goods jumped up by 23.1 percent y -o
-y in 2017 due to higher growth of the trad-
ing partners, and higher global prices of base 
metals. Exports of services grew by 17.7 per-
cent in 2017, mainly due to higher travel 
expenditures by the diaspora.  
Higher growth continued to foster job crea-
tion in 2017. Employment grew by 1.2pp y -o-
y in the third quarter of 2017, however, as 
labor force participation expanded further, 
unemployment increased by 2.7 pp. Despite 
the recent improvements, employment is still 
low at 29.7 percent on average as a share of 
total population. The share of self -employed 
and unpaid family workers, i.e. those in vul-
nerable employment and measures job quali-
ty, remains high at 23 percent; the youth 
unemployment rate slightly increased reach-
ing 53.3 percent in Q3 2017. The duration of 
unemployment is worrying with over 70 
percent of the unemployed seeking a job for 
over a year.   KOSOVO

ners pose risks to the outlook.  
Perceived fragility of the government, 
with only 61 out of 120 votes in the parlia-
ment, can slow down the implementation 
of public projects through the investment 
clause. In addition, the delay in fiscal re-
forms such as the implementation of the 
cap on the war veteran ’s benefits, further 
increases in untargeted categorical social 
benefits, and unfunded early retirement 
schemes increase fiscal pressures.  
Reform priorities should include shifting 
sources of growth towards tradable sec-
tors and increasing productivity to ad-
dress high unemployment, low participa-
tion rates, and poverty.  
  
Outlook  
 
Economic growth is projected at 4.8 per-
cent in 2018 -2020, propelled by higher 
capital spending. Growth in public invest-
ment is expected to be driven by several 
projects under preparation, including the 
railway project and regional roads fi-
nanced by IFIs. Private investment is ex-
pected to increase reflecting improve-
ments in the business environment,  and 
increase in credit due to the partial credit 
guarantee fund for SMEs established in 
2017.  Higher wages and social spending, 
growth in remittances and credit to house-
holds are expected to promote household 
consumption adding an additional 2.3 pp 
to growth. Exports are likely to benefit 
from robust growth in Europe and higher 
base metal prices. However, net exports 
are projected to subtract 0.9 pp from 
growth in 2018 because of higher imports 
linked to public investment projects.  The CAD is expected to reach 6 percent of 
GDP in 2018. Increased demand for in-
vestment goods is expected to widen the 
CAD in 2018, despite higher exports pro-
jected. Net FDI and remittances, are ex-
pected to finance larger shares of the CAD 
as growth in Europe firms up and larger 
implementation of the Stabilization and 
Association Agreement.  
Poverty, measured at the lower middle -
income poverty line (US$ 3.2/day, 2011 
PPP), is expected to decline slightly to 2.55 
in 2018, from 2.6 percent in 2017 driven by 
stronger growth.  High unemployment 
and inactivity rates remain the key imped-
iments to sustainable poverty reduction.

are tilted to the downside. Lower than

The Kyrgyz economy has recovered from 
the external shocks of 2014 -15 as growth 
accelerated to 4.5% in 2017, from 3.8% a 
year earlier. Growth was driven by the 
non-gold industry (22%) while it deceler-
ated in other main sectors: gold, construc-
tion, agriculture and services. On the de-
mand side, growth was supported by 
public investment, net exports and private 
consumption fueled by a steady rebound 
in remittances inflows.  
An expansionary fiscal stance was main-
tained, even as external tailwinds strength-
ened. The estimated overall fiscal deficit 
was 5% of GDP in 2017, down from 6.6% 
in 2016 and lower than the budgeted defi-
cit of 7.5%, but still above the levels of pre-
vious years. Both tax and non -tax revenues 
increased as a share of GDP. In addition, 
the budget received rising grant support 
from international donors. At the same 
time, expenditures increased, driven large-
ly by capital outlays. Substantial overruns 
in current spending in the first part of the 
year were partially mitigated by expendi-
ture restraint in the last quarter of 2017. 
The deficit was mainly financed by foreign 
borrowing, which increased total public 
debt to 63.2% of GDP from 61.4% in 2016.  
The current account deficit is estimated to 
have narrowed to 9.4% of GDP in 2017 
from 12.1% a year before, as exports 
picked -up (+14.5% in US dollar terms) and 
remittances continued to grow (by 24.2% 
in US dollar terms). The export perfor-
mance was driven mainly by non -gold exports, which benefited from the recov-
ery in regional demand as well as im-
proved compliance by Kyrgyz producers 
with Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) 
quality standards. Imports are estimated 
to have risen by 12% (in US dollar terms), 
a slower increase than might have been 
envisaged given the improvement in re-
mittances and high levels of public invest-
ment. The current account deficit was fi-
nanced by FDI and government borrow-
ing. International reserves increased 
slightly to US$2.1 billion, covering about 4 
months of imports.    
The stronger balance of payments (and 
corresponding foreign exchange liquidity 
in the economy) led to a further apprecia-
tion of the Kyrgyz som by 0.6% in 2017 
(8.8% in 2016). In real effective terms, 
however, the som depreciated by 0.5%, 
largely reflecting relative inflation dynam-
ics with key trading partners.  
Inflation rose slightly in 2017 reaching 
3.7%, given buoyant domestic demand. 
With inflation still below the National 
Bank (NBKR) target of 5 -7%, monetary 
policy remained accommodative. Econom-
ic activity was supported by a recovery in 
credit to the economy (14% growth), fol-
lowing a decline early in the year.    
The poverty rate (measured at below 
US$3.2 per day, 2011 PPP terms) is esti-
mated to have fallen to 19% in 2016. Low 
consumer price growth and higher re-
mittance inflows supported household 
consumption. At the same time, moderate 
growth in services and agriculture, where 
about 50% of the bottom 40 are employed, 
constrained real labor income growth for 
the poor.  Table 1 2017

Outlook  
 
Real GDP growth is projected to deceler-
ate slightly to 4.2% in 2018 -as industrial 
output growth moderates - and then pick 
up to reach 5% by 2020. This scenario as-
sumes that recovery takes hold in Russia 
and Kazakhstan, benefiting the Kyrgyz 
economy via the traditional remittance 
and trade channels. An additional boost is 
expected to come from exports, thanks to 
a number of developments, which in-
clude: (i) enhanced access to the EEU mar-
ket; and (ii) improved bilateral relations 
with Uzbekistan, which should lead to 
higher trade between the two countries. 
These effects should mitigate the antici-
pated moderation of public expenditure.  
Inflation is envisaged to remain in line 
with the NBKR target, assuming no sig-
nificant global food price increases and 
relative exchange rate stability.  
While remittance inflows are expected to 
grow further, the current account deficit 
is projected to remain elevated at around 
1 0 %  o f  G D P ,  r e fl e c t i n g  s t r u c t u r a l  f e a -
tures of the economy and continued 
high, albeit gradually moderating, levels 
of public investment.  The fiscal deficit is projected to decline to 
2.9% of GDP by 2020. This will be achieved 
through measures to increase tax revenues 
and curtail current spending, while capital 
expenditures would remain robust at about 
7.6% of GDP on average (although falling to 
6.1% in 2020 as externally financed projects 
decline). Over 2018 -20, tax revenues should 
increase as a share of GDP, with measures 
to: (i) expand the tax base by encouraging 
businesses to formalize, (ii) improve the 
administration of taxes, (iii) reduce tax ex-
emptions, and (iv) increase some tax rates. 
Over the same period, expenses are target-
ed to decline by over 5 percentage points 
(from 38.7% in 2018) as a result of efforts to 
(i) streamline non -priority purchases of 
goods and services, (ii) reduce the wage bill 
as a share of GDP, and (iii) strengthen pub-
lic procurement.  
Modest increases in growth in agriculture 
and construction, and a solid performance of 
remittances, are likely to support rural pov-
erty reduction. Social transfers will continue 
to play an important role in driving poverty 
reduction in both urban and rural areas. A 
scheduled increase in pensions should also 
benefit poor households given that pensions 
represent close to 15% of income among the 
poor.  The poverty rate is projected to decline 
to 18.5% in 2018 and 16.7% in 2020.   
Risks and challenges  
 
The outlook is subject to downside risks. 
Growth will continue to be highly de-
pendent on exogenous regional develop-
ments. Specifically, a slowdown in Russia 
and Kazakhstan could affect negatively 
the baseline scenario via remittances and 
trade. Adverse exchange rate develop-
ments could heighten competition in the 
domestic and EEU markets.     
A core challenge continues to be to accel-
erate the process of convergence of local 
production to EEU standards. This would 
help Kyrgyz producers to boost exports of 
agricultural and textile products in the 
short and medium run.    
Another challenge will be to bring fis-
cal policy back to a sustainable path, 
while continuing to provide adequate 
support to the economy. Several policy 
decisions taken in the run -up to the 
Presidential elections in October 2017 
are expected to add structural pressure 
on spending, including a universal ex-
tension of the previously income -
targeted benefit for low income families 
with children, which will complicate 
the task of fiscal consolidation.

62 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
The political turmoil of 2015 -2017 slowed 
real GDP growth in 2017 from 2.9 percent 
in 2016 to zero percent in 2017, driven by a 
fall in investments. The inauguration of 
the new government in June 2017 resolved 
the stalemate as evidenced by the compa-
nies’ improved expectations on future 
production. Investment fell by 4.5 percent 
y-o-y in 2017, but it started recovering by 
year -end with recovering investor confi-
dence. Private consumption was the only 
contributor to growth in 2017, supported 
by higher employment and wages. Net -
exports contributed negatively to growth 
(-0.7 pp). Solid exports growth was pro-
pelled by the recovery in the Euro area but 
was not enough to compensate for rising 
imports for energy, FDI -related imports, 
and iron and steel. At the sector level, 
construction and manufacturing stalled in 
2017, with construction falling by almost 
14 percent y -o-y in real terms as both pri-
vate and public construction activities 
stalled. Mining, wholesale and retail trade 
and agriculture were the only sectors that 
contributed positively to growth, support-
ed by rising metal prices, growth in dis-
posable income and a favorable harvest 
season, respectively.  
Inflation remained low in 2017 at 1.4 per-
cent, although it increased from a 2016 de-
flation, driven by rising prices of food and 
beverages, energy (including oil), clothing 
and footwear and communications.    
Despite slower growth, there were improve-
ments in the labor market. Employment  grew by 2.4 percent y -o-y in 2017, helped 
in part by employment subsidies in the 
first part of the year, through which al-
most third of the net new jobs were creat-
ed. The employment rate has been con-
stantly improving, but remains low at 44 
percent, meaning that more than half of 
the working age population is either un-
employed or outside of the labor force. 
Most of the jobs created were in wholesale 
and retail trade, accommodation and food 
services and manufacturing —the latter 
sectors with links to the FDI -economy, 
which benefit from tax exemptions and 
other government support. As a result, the 
unemployment rate fell to a historical low, 
at 22.4 percent in 2017, close to 80 percent 
of which is long -term.  
Poverty is estimated to have continued 
declining in 2017. Poverty (at US$5.5/day 
at 2011 PPP) is projected to have fallen to 
21 percent in 2017, continuing a decreas-
ing trend present since 2009. Employment 
growth and increases in salaries, especial-
ly in the labor -intensive sectors, are ex-
pected to have driven most of the poverty 
reduction in 2017. Pensions, which played 
a role in the 2009 -2014 decrease, are un-
likely to have played a relevant role in 
recent poverty dynamics.  
Revenue gains in 2017 were offset by in-
creases in spending, resulting in un-
changed fiscal deficit —at 2.7 percent of 
GDP. Revenues increased on the back of 
solid VAT and collection of the social se-
curity contributions, while expenditures 
increased due to higher spending for 
health, pensions, and subsidies. Capital 
spending once again remained under -
executed reflecting a slowdown in project MACEDONIA

Sources: FYR Macedonia State Statistics Office and World Bank staff calculations.  Sources: WDI and own calculations based on SILC 2010 -2015.  As investment contracted after a pro-
longed political crisis, economic growth 
slowed to zero percent in 2017. Growth is 
projected to rise to 2.3 percent in 2018, 
driven by consumption and recovering 
investment. Despite the slowdown, labor 
market improved thanks to public subsi-
dies; but employment and labor force 
participation rates remain low compared 
to the EU. The fiscal deficit remained 
unchanged in 2017, with higher spend-
ing offsetting improved tax collection. 
Poverty continued to decline in 2017, 
propelled by job creation.

anteed debt declined to 47.5 percent in 
2017, from 48.4 percent in 2016, but due to 
a drawdown on accumulated deposits to 
reduce new borrowing.  
Credit growth increased in 2017. House-
hold credit grew by 9.2 percent, while 
corporate lending remained subdued 
throughout 2017 (2.6 percent). The loan -to
-deposit ratio stood at 88 percent, which 
should allow banks to expand lending 
activities. Non -performing loans (NPLs) 
stood at 6.3 percent, similar to 6.4 percent 
at end -2016, but corporate NPLs increased 
slightly to 9.9 percent.  
The current account deficit narrowed to 
1.1 percent of GDP in 2017. Solid export 
performance of FDIs, iron and steel, furni-
ture and tobacco helped to reduce the 
goods and services deficit to 13.9 percent 
of GDP (from 15 percent in 2016). Net 
private transfer inflows increased slightly 
to 15.8 percent of GDP, while primary 
income deficit widened further to 4.2 per-
cent of GDP as foreign investors kept re-
patriating profits amidst the political tur-
moil. Foreign direct investments declined 
in 2017 to only 2.3 percent of GDP, com-
pared to 3.2 percent in 2016. At end -2017, 
foreign reserves stood at 4.4 months of imports and were further replenished in 
January 2018 as the Government issued a 
7-year EUR 500 million Eurobond at 2.75 
percent which fully covers government 
borrowing requirements for 2018.  
 
   
Outlook  
 
The economic outlook is positive, with 
growth expected to average 2.7 percent 
during 2018 -2020. Construction activity is 
expected to recover, as the construction of 
two highways is resumed. The manufac-
turing sector is also expected to recover, a 
process that began in late 2017, propelled 
by improved foreign demand from the 
EU. Private consumption is projected to 
rise supported by higher employment and 
as the new authorities indicated rise in 
social transfers.  
Poverty is likely to continue its down-
ward trend in 2018 -2020 with improved 
economic outlook. Public investment in 
infrastructure should sustain employ-
ment creation. Increases in social transfers 
should also translate into further poverty 
reductions, if properly designed and 
means -tested.  Fiscal deficit is planned to remain un-
changed in 2018 leading to rise in public 
debt to 50 percent of GDP.  
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
With the political crisis now resolved, the 
main risk comes from fiscal vulnerabilities 
and low potential growth. A low revenue 
to GDP ratio, a growing deficit in the pen-
sion system, higher interest payments, 
and accumulated arrears are risks to fiscal 
sustainability. Discussions about raising 
untargeted social transfers compound the 
sustainability concerns.  
Credible fiscal consolidation program 
focused on strengthening efficiency of 
public spending and broadening of the tax 
base would help to stabilize public debt, 
rebuild fiscal buffers against future shocks 
and increase investor confidence.  
Ensuring the backward linkages of the 
FDIs, unlocking potentials in the energy, 
tourism and agriculture sectors, as well 
as reducing the overregulation in pro-
fessional and infrastructure network 
services could help increasing the poten-
tial growth.

64 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
Growth reached 4.5 percent in 2017 on ac-
count of strong consumption led by the 
ongoing recovery in remittances and in-
creases in real wages. A double -digit in-
crease in public investments stimulated 
gross fixed capital formation (+5.1 percent). 
Despite robust exports supported by the 
good harvest of the past two years, imports 
increased rapidly resulting in a negative 
contribution of net exports to growth ( -2.7 
percentage points). On the production side, 
growth has been mainly driven by the re-
tail and wholesale trade (+1.3 percentage 
points), followed by growth in agriculture 
(+1 percentage points) and industry (+0.4 
percentage points).  
After a sharp deceleration in 2016, the in-
flation rate averaged 6.6 percent in 2017, 
just above the target corridor of 5 percent 
+/- 1.5 percent. Increases in regulated pric-
es, unfavorable climatic conditions in 
Spring which affected seasonal agricultur-
al outputs, and stronger internal demand 
accelerated the inflation rate, which has 
been out of the target corridor since April 
2017. To stimulate credit activity and ab-
sorb the existing liquidity after the bank-
ing crisis, throughout 2017, the NBM grad-
ually reduced the base interest rate (from 9 
percent to 6.5 percent), while increasing 
the reserve requirement ratio to a record 
high of 40 percent. Strong foreign inflows 
pushed the appreciation of the Moldovan 
Leu, tempering the cost -push inflation 
pressures. By end -January 2018, the infla-
tion rate registered 6.5 percent y/y.  The increasing real wages and a recover-
ing flow of remittances, as well as the 
favorable 2016 harvest have been associ-
ated with a downward trend in the pov-
erty headcount, which, measured at the 
international moderate poverty thresh-
old of US$ 5.5/day in 2011 PPP, de-
creased to 16.3 percent in 2015 from 18.4 
in 2014, and continued decreasing in 
2016. The unemployment rate fell form 
4.9 percent in 2015 to 4.2 percent in 2016, 
the decline being particularly pro-
nounced in rural areas (0.9 percentage 
points), where the incidence of poverty 
is higher. Salaries increased by a further 
5.2 percent in real terms in 2017, sup-
porting household welfare.  
The external position remains stable, de-
spite a recent increase in current account 
deficit. In the first nine months of 2017, 
exports increased in nominal terms by 
25.2 percent, remittances increased by 12.1 
percent, while net direct investments in-
creased 1.2 percentage points of GDP 
compared to end -2016, on account of rein-
vested profits, reaching 2.5 percent of 
GDP. Yet, supported by a stronger Leu 
and imports of electricity, imports in-
creased (+22.5 percent y/y), determining 
the widening of the current account deficit 
by 3.4 percentage points y/y reaching 9.2 
percent of GDP. The current account defi-
cit continues to be financed predominant-
ly through external debt. As of end -
September 2017, total external debt grew 
by 8.1 percent totaling 83 percent of GDP. 
Against this background, by end -January 
2018 foreign reserves reached an all -time 
record of 2.9 billion USD, covering more 
than 5 months of imports.  MOLDOVA

Growth momentum is expected to be pre-

growing consumption and investments,

its macroeconomic buffers, major policy 
challenges related to upcoming elections, 
governance, particularly in the financial 
sector, to the efficiency of public spending, 
and to revenue mobilization remain.  Table 1 2017

65 MPO  Apr 18  Following two years of tight fiscal poli-
cies, a lower than expected deficit was 
registered in 2017, as fiscal revenues out-
paced the double -digit increase in expend-
itures. Following the under execution in 
2016, public spending increased 12.5 per-
cent y/y. Supported by a strong increase in 
fiscal revenues and better compliance, 
public revenues increased 16.2 percent y/
y. Buoyant foreign trade was also reflected 
in strong collections of VAT (+15.8 per-
cent, y/y) and excises (+30.9 percent, y/y). 
As a result, the fiscal deficit was 2.2 per-
centage points higher, totaling -0.8 percent 
of GDP.  
 
 
Outlook 
 
Growth is expected to be robust and reach 
3.8% in 2018 and 3.7% in 2019 but remain 
below the historical averages (of 4.6%). In 
the medium -term the recovery in re-
mittances together with private wage 
growth will sustain private consumption, 
which will remain a key driver of growth. 
Import growth will outpace export 
growth, leading to a negative contribution 
of net trade to GDP growth. With parlia-
mentary elections in November 2018, after 
a prolonged contraction, the Government plans to increase public investments, with 
a focus on the road sector. Still, structural 
weaknesses will contain growth at around 
3.5 percent. As consumption and imports 
strengthen, the current account deficit is 
expected to gradually increase, but to re-
main below its historical average thanks 
to revitalization of foreign inflows. The 
inflation rate is expected to reach the low-
er bound of the target corridor in 2018 due 
to base effects and lower regulated prices 
and to gradually increasing to the target 
of 5 percent in medium term. In the base-
line scenario, fiscal deficits are projected to 
remain under control. Due to mandated 
indexation and valorization of pensions, 
wage increases and additional public capi-
tal investments, expenditures will increase 
reaching about 3 percent of GDP in 2018.  
The factors underlying a favorable growth 
forecast similarly suggest a further decline 
in the poverty headcount during the pro-
jection period, following the trend from 
recent years. Increases in real wages and 
remittances, as well as a good harvest year 
should support household welfare, inclu-
sively in rural areas, where the incidence 
of poverty remains higher. The rate of 
wage increases according to latest data 
from Q3 of 2017 suggests that on an annu-
al basis wages in agriculture increased 
faster than in the economy overall. The poverty headcount, measured at the inter-
national moderate poverty threshold of 
$5.5/day is projected to decline from 16.3 
percent in 2015 to 12.7 percent in 2018 and 
11.7 percent in 2019.  
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
After two years of good climatic condi-
tions, extreme weather may affect agricul-
tural output with consequences for overall 
growth. The banking sector has stabilized, 
yet it is important to continue reforms and 
strengthen the transparency in the sector. 
Moreover, the increased demand (+30 per-
cent in the first half of 2017) observed for 
the unregulated and poorly monitored non
-banking financial intermediation sector 
raises concerns. Weaker growth of key 
trade partners and potential changes in 
international trade and migration relations 
could undermine exports and remittance 
flows. While the authorities have made 
efforts to reduce macroeconomic risks, fast-
er growth is necessary to converge with EU 
countries. For this to happen, Moldova 
needs deep transformational reforms that 
will create new and better jobs in the pri-
vate sector and consequently will create 
space for public investment needs.

The economy grew by 4.3 percent in 2017. 
Investment made the strongest contribu-
tion to growth at 5 percentage points (pp), 
as the construction of the Bar -Boljare 
highway and residential construction 
accelerated. Consumption also grew, con-
tributing an additional 3.7 percentage 
points, supported by employment and 
wage growth. Net exports continued to 
contribute negatively to growth, but in 
2017 subtracted less from growth due to a 
record tourism season and a pickup in 
goods exports from the metal industry, 
driven by improved EU demand. Due to 
high import content, the growth impact of 
the higher investment for highway con-
struction is subdued.  
Credit growth increased by close to 12 
percent in 2017, as household lending 
surged, amid subdued corporate lending. 
NPLs declined to 7 percent of total loans, 
supported by relaxed voluntary financial 
restructuring rules. Current account deficit 
further widened to 18.9 percent of GDP in 
2017 on the back of rising construction -
related imports and despite rise in exports 
of metals, mineral ore sales, and tourism. 
Net FDI inflows increased to 11.2 percent 
of GDP, financing two -thirds of the CAD. 
Still, after a decline in 2016 to 160 percent, 
external debt increased again in 2017 to an 
estimated 162 percent of GDP and remains 
the highest in the region.  
Robust growth led to employment rise by 
2.5 percent in 2017; however, it slowed 
down in the last quarter by 0.2 percentage points --first such decline since late 2013, 
due to agriculture, mining industry, retail 
and real estate. While the registered un-
employment rate increased to above 22 
percent in 2017, given the large informali-
ty (one out of three jobs), the survey -based 
unemployment rate shows a decline by 
over 1 pp, to 16.1 percent by September 
2017 (a four -quarter average). Survey -
based employment rate grew by one per-
centage point to 45.9 percent along with 
the activity rate, albeit at a slower pace.  
Poverty is estimated to have declined in 
the past few years as economic growth 
picked up and social transfers surged. In 
2017, however, it was difficult to achieve 
significant poverty reduction given the 
withdrawal of the mothers ’ benefit in the 
second half of the year. Additionally, led 
by public sector wage dynamics, real 
gross wages declined by 0.4 percent in 
2017. Poverty (measured as consumption 
below the standardized middle -income -
country poverty line of $5.5/day in 2011 
PPP terms) declined from 8.7 percent in 
2012 to an estimated 4.4 percent in 2017.  
Inflation picked up in 2017 to 2.4 percent 
on the back of rise in excises on tobacco, 
alcohol and sugary drinks, and spillovers 
from international oil and food price. Due 
to the increase in the VAT rate from 19 to 
21 percent, and excises on tobacco and 
alcohol, inflation increased by 2.6 percent 
yoy in January 2018.  
Government launched an ambitious fiscal 
consolidation program in 2017 reducing 
the deficit by one percentage point of 
GDP in 2017 compared to a no -reform 
scenario. By December, tax revenues in-
creased by over 9 percent y -o-y led by MONTENEGRO  
FIGURE 1  Montenegro / Real GDP growth and contributions 
to real GDP growth  FIGURE 2  Montenegro / Actual and projected poverty rates 
and real private consumption per capita  
Sources: MONSTAT, World Bank.   Sources: World Bank (see notes to Table 2).   Economic growth accelerated in 2017 due 
to surge in investment led by the highway 
construction and a historically strong 
tourism season. Employment increased 
continuing four years of growth. Howev-
er, unemployment remains high amid 
high informality and increased labor im-
ports. Labor force participation increased 
slightly led by male activation. While 
fiscal consolidation efforts are underway, 
led by tax changes, high deficit and public 
debt require continued efforts. The im-
proved credit rating outlook is providing 
easier access to capital market.  Table 1 2017

Spending increased by close to 12 percent 
on the back of tripled capital budget. On 
the other hand, wage reduction and abol-
ishment of the mothers ’ benefit from the 
second half of 2017 helped decelerate 
growth of the wage bill and social trans-
fers. Consequently, general government 
deficit increased from 3.1 percent in 2016 
to an estimated 5.2 percent of GDP in 
2017. Public debt including guarantees 
increased to 74 percent of GDP by end -
2017. After the initial fiscal consolidation 
efforts, outlook on the credit rating of B+ 
improved to stable. This has allowed easi-
er access to capital market for a regular 
refinancing of liabilities coming due in 
2018 and 2019 -2021.  
 
 
Outlook 
 
The economy is expected to grow by an 
average of 2.5 percent annually in 2018 -20 
on the back of public investments and 
personal consumption. While growth of investment will slow down as the high-
way construction gets to its closure, its 
contribution to growth will remain strong 
in 2018. Current imbalances are likely to 
stay high given the import dependence of 
the current growth pattern.  
Inflation is projected at 2.5 percent in the 
period 2018 -19, as the VAT rate rise adds 
to the current inflation growth in 2018. 
Fiscal deficit is projected to be brought 
down to 3.2 percent in 2018, and slowly 
reaching surplus by 2020.  
With the potential poverty impact of fiscal 
consolidation measures, in 2018 poverty is 
expected to slightly increase as mothers ’ 
benefits phase out. Poverty is likely to 
resume its decline in 2019 -20 to an esti-
mated 4.4 percent by 2020, subject to im-
provements in private sector employment 
and earnings.  
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
The positive economic outlook faces high, 
but moderating risks. As the highway construction is completed in 2019, growth 
will slow unless productivity gains and 
new private sector investments realize. 
Large fiscal deficit and growing public 
debt call for the decisive implementation 
of the recently adopted fiscal consolida-
tion program. The fiscal framework that 
aims to have a balanced budget by 2019, 
from over 5 percent deficit in 2017, will 
require credible spending consolidation in 
wage bill, social transfers, and operational 
costs to put public deficit and debt on a 
sustainable trajectory.  
External imbalances are still high, adding 
to an already high external vulnerability. 
Enhancing policy predictability and accel-
erating the pace of structural reforms, 
would be needed for their moderation.  
Reducing unemployment, especially for 
youth and mitigating short -term poverty 
and social impacts of fiscal consolidation 
and facilitating access to employment 
need to be an important part of the poli-
cy agenda.

68 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
Booming domestic demand boosted real 
GDP growth to 4.6 percent in 2017, from 
2.9 percent in 2016. Powered by an ex-
tremely strong labor market and social 
spending (mainly for the Family 500+ pro-
gram), private consumption grew by 4.8 
percent, adding 2.8 percentage points to 
GDP growth.  
The biggest positive development in 2017 
was a 5.4 percent expansion in gross fixed 
investment. This was a remarkable recov-
ery from a 7.9 percent drop in 2016 caused 
by a cyclical fall in EU -funded projects, 
reduced FDI inflow, and elevated political 
risk. The rebound in investment resulted 
from the resumption of EU funding and 
removal of a source of instability in the 
banking sector related to the conversion of 
foreign -currency -denominated mortgages 
to local currency.  
The renewed investment helped to 
boost import demand in the second half 
of the year. Hence, despite heavy de-
mand for Poland ’s exports from outside 
of the euro zone, net exports contribut-
ed just 0.1 percentage points to overall 
GDP growth.  
Labor market conditions have tightened 
further. The ratio of vacancies to unem-
ployment has shot past 10 percent; in 
four years the number of low -skilled un-
employed has been cut in half and now 
accounts for just 30 percent of unemploy-
ment; and, for the first time since the 
transition, long -term unemployment 
dipped below 500,000. Employment rates  continued to rise and labor shortages have 
started to affect business activity.  
After two years of persistent deflation, 
consumer prices rose an average of 2 per-
cent in 2017, mainly because of higher 
global commodity prices, food inflation 
and firmer domestic demand. At 2.1 per-
cent year on year in December 2017, infla-
tion is still below the National Bank of 
Poland (NBP) medium -term target of 2.5 
percent. Demand -side price pressures are 
modest so far, with core inflation just 0.9 
percent year on year in December. Real 
monetary conditions eased considerably 
in 2017, despite nominal appreciation of 
the zloty. Since March 2015 the NBP Mon-
etary Policy Council has kept its bench-
mark policy rate unchanged at 1.5 percent. 
The zloty continued to be somewhat vola-
tile in 2017 but strengthened overall 
against the euro and the US dollar.  
It is estimated that poverty and shared 
prosperity indicators continued to im-
prove in 2017 in light of surging private 
consumption supported by a tight labor 
market and government social pro-
grams. Poverty is expected to have de-
clined from 2.7 percent in 2015 to 1.3 
percent in 2017 using the $5.50/day 2011 
PPP poverty line.  
More efficient tax collection helped the gov-
ernment to realize its ambitious 2017 spend-
ing plans while running the tightest budget 
execution on record. This was possible be-
cause more was collected in taxes, mostly 
from indirect taxes (due to robust private 
consumption and improved tax compli-
ance) but also from one -off non -tax reve-
nues, such as higher NBP profits. In 2016 
the general government deficit narrowed  to POLAND  
Sources: MFMod, World Bank.  Sources: World Bank (see notes to Table 2).  Real GDP growth picked up to 4.6 per-
cent in 2017, driven primarily by private 
consumption. A recovery in investment 
in the end of 2017 promises continued 
growth. The main risks to medium term 
growth relate to labor shortages and lower 
allocation of EU funds for Poland. Pov-
erty will continue to decline in line with 
growing disposable incomes. Although 
the general deficit is at a record low, 
structural weakening is possible. Fiscal 
adjustment may constitute a challenge as 
Poland prepares for elections.  Table 1 2017

Outlook 
 
In light of the positive investment results 
in 2017 and improved growth prospects 
in the EU, the previous projection of real 
GDP growth for Poland has been revised 
upward by 0.2 percentage points: again, 
driven by both private consumption and 
investment; economic growth may reach 
4.2 percent in 2018 and 3.7 percent in 
2019. Household spending will benefit 
f r o m  g r o w t h  i n  t h e  r e a l  w a g e  b i l l  o f  
more than 8 percent in 2018 -19, plus 
higher state spending on pensions and 
social benefits. Rising real incomes are 
expected to lead to further declines in 
poverty. The $5.50/ day 2011 PPP pov-
erty rate is projected to decline to 1.2 
percent in 2018 and further to 1.0 percent 
by 2020.  
Public spending is likely to be strong, 
supported by EU funds and the political cycle leading up to the elections. High 
corporate profitability and EU funds 
should support private investment. Ex-
ports and industrial production are like-
ly to benefit from stronger European 
demand in 2018- 19, but imports may 
outpace both.  
The general government deficit is set to 
widen again in 2018 to about 2 percent of 
GDP —but still safely below the 3 per-
cent EU threshold. Spending is expected 
to rise due to higher government con-
sumption, local pre -elections investment, 
and the decision to roll back the planned 
increases of the retirement age. The reve-
nue side will also contribute to the in-
creasing budget gap: non -tax revenues 
could be lower this year due to less NBP 
profit, and the change in retirement age 
will depress social contributions from 
the cohort eligible for earlier retirement. 
Public debt will stabilize around 51 per-
cent of GDP in 2018 -19, but the structur-
al budget deficit will widen.  
The current -account is likely to come 
back to a small deficit in 2018 as robust 
household consumption, higher invest-
ment, and a firming in global commodity 
markets push up the volume and cost of 
imports. Nonetheless, the current -
account deficit will remain modest in 
2018 -20 at less than 0.5 percent of GDP.   
Risks and challenges  
 
There are three main clouds on Poland ’s 
economic horizon: (i) Structural weaken-
ing in public finance; (ii) a shortage of la-
bor; and (iii) EU sanctions against Poland 
for not respecting EU democratic values. 
First, the government's spending plans, 
with increases in social benefits and public 
investment, and the reduction in the statu-
tory retirement age, could erode the struc-
ture of public finances. Strengthening the 
fiscal position might be difficult given lo-
cal, presidential, and parliamentary elec-
tions all coming up within 18 months. Sec-
ond, the shortage of labor may soon weigh 
heavily on GDP growth, and would be 
exacerbated by retirement of a greater part 
of the workforce. Too few workers could 
negatively affect production capacities and 
investment. This would heighten pressure 
on the government to encourage immigra-
tion, which could come primarily from 
Ukraine. Third, the government's failure to 
address rule of law issues and a vote by 
the European Parliament in late 2017 to 
initiate Article 7 proceedings against Po-
land may lead the EU to impose sanctions, 
possibly lowering the EU fund allocation 
for 2021–27.

70 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
Private consumption (+8.8 percent) was 
the main driver of growth in 2017, fueled 
by tax cuts; hikes in minimum and public -
sector wages; and increases in pensions 
that boosted disposable incomes. With a 
5.4 percent increase, investment also 
showed signs of recovery. Exports grew 
strongly (+9.5 percent), but were outpaced 
by imports (+11.1 percent). On the produc-
tion side, ICT (+10.9 percent) and industry 
(+8 percent) were the main drivers of 
growth, with agriculture (+18.3 percent) 
performing better than expected, facilitat-
ed by good weather conditions.  
Fiscal policy was pro -cyclical in 2017. In-
creases in public wages and pensions led 
to a 22 percent hike in the compensation 
of employees and a 15.5 percent increase 
in current spending, outpacing fiscal reve-
nue growth (+12.5 percent). The deficit, 
however, remained below 3 percent of 
GDP because of the decline in public in-
vestment ( -9.5 percent), including low 
utilization of the EU funds.  
The expansionary fiscal policy led to an 
overheating of the economy, contributing 
also to inflation to 4.7 percent in February 
2018 – above the upper limit of the Na-
tional Bank of Romania (NBR) band. In 
response, the NBR board increased the 
policy rate by 25 ppts (to 2.25 percent) in 
two consecutive meetings in early 2018. 
This came amid robust private sector cred-
it growth (up 5.6 percent as of December 
2017) and concerns over the fiscal stance. 
The current account deficit deteriorated to 3.4 percent of GDP at end -2017 reflecting 
the strong imports growth.  
The labor market benefited from the eco-
nomic growth, with unemployment fall-
ing to 4.6 percent as of December 2017 – a 
25-year low – and real wages increasing 
by 8.1 percent. Nonetheless, the low em-
ployment rate of 65.3 in Q3 2017, down 0.2 
percentage points from the previous quar-
ter, reflects persistent structural rigidities 
in the labor market.  
In line with economic growth, a boost in 
private consumption and labor market 
improvements, the poverty rate corre-
sponding to upper middle-income coun-
tries (using the $5.50/day 2011 PPP pov-
erty line) is estimated to have declined 
from 26.1 percent in 2015 to 23.6 percent 
in 2017, continuing its downward path 
since the peak of the crisis in 2011 (31.7 
percent). High poverty incidence contin-
ues to be associated with reliance on agri-
culture and in rural/marginalized areas. 
Employment gains in sectors that employ 
a large share of low -skilled people have 
helped improve the incomes of the bottom 
40 and prevented a further increase in the 
Gini index in 2015.  
 
 
Outlook  
 
The economy is projected to continue to 
grow above potential in 2018. GDP will 
likely expand by around 5.1 percent in 
2018, driven by the fiscal stimulus and 
aided by a resurgent EU. Continued 
growth in consumption is expected to 
widen the current account deficit to 4.3 ROMANIA

gent EU. Improvements in the labor mar-
ket contributed to poverty reduction. 
Growth will remain solid in 2018, but 
medium-term risks to the outlook have 
increased. Pressures on the budget deficit, 
arising from an increase in recurrent 
spending, will continue in 2018. To im-
prove the quality of growth, renewed atten-
tion should be given to public investment .  Table 1 2017

around 5 percent in mid -2018 reflecting 
the excess domestic demand and the fad-
ing out of the base effect of the tax cuts. 
The NBR anticipates a gradual subsequent 
decline in inflation towards 3.5 percent at 
the end of 2018, due to a slowdown in 
private consumption dynamics as no fur-
ther fiscal boost to households ’ real dis-
posable income is envisioned.  
The fiscal measures passed in 2017 have 
put pressure on the consolidated budget 
deficit. In the absence of corrective 
measures, the fiscal deficit is projected to 
reach 3.3 percent of GDP in 2018, which 
would place Romania on a trajectory to re -
entering the Excessive Deficit Procedure 
of the EU. However, the government has 
stated that, like in 2017, it would be ready 
to promote adjustment measures should 
the deficit threaten the 3 percent ceiling. 
The widening of the fiscal deficit would 
push public debt to 46.8 percent of GDP at 
end-2020, from 44.5 percent in 2017. De-
spite this, public debt remains one of the 
lowest in the EU.  
Strong private consumption aided by the 
expansionary fiscal policy and continued growth in real wages, partly supported by 
minimum wage increases, should boost 
real incomes and lead to further declines 
in poverty incidence. Moreover, the 
planned introduction of the Minimum 
Social Inclusion Income program (MSII) is 
expected to improve targeting and in-
crease the level of benefits for the most 
vulnerable. The $5.50/day 2011 PPP pov-
erty rate is projected to decline to 22.6 
percent in 2018, 21.7 percent in 2019, and 
20.9 percent in 2020.  
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
Accumulating fiscal pressures and excess 
domestic demand limit the space for poli-
cy-makers to maneuver in 2018 and be-
yond. The current account deficit is on the 
rise, and inflationary pressures persist. 
These developments leave the Romanian 
economy vulnerable to exogenous shocks. 
The authorities may need to take correc-
tive measures to keep the deficit below 3 
percent of GDP in 2018 through good 
quality fiscal adjustment. Externally, a likely tapering of the quantitative easing 
in the Eurozone and higher global interest 
rates may lead to a repositioning in inves-
tor sentiment towards the emerging econ-
omies and to higher refinancing costs, 
further reinforcing fiscal pressures. On the 
upside, a better-than -projected economic 
performance of the Eurozone will act as a 
driver of growth in the broader EU area, 
including Romania. 
Renewed efforts are needed to improve 
labor participation and generate broad -
based employment, as unemployment 
remains high among youth and the low -
skilled, and to ensure that all Romanians 
obtain access to high quality public ser-
vices. Gradually, the focus of the fiscal 
policy should be rebalanced away from 
boosting consumption towards mobiliz-
ing investment, including from the EU 
funds, to support a sustainable EU con-
vergence path and social inclusion. Re-
forms in public administration and 
SOEs, increased regulatory predictabil-
ity, as well as policies to address the 
large social and spatial discrepancies 
should be on the agenda of priorities of 
the government.

In 2017, Russia ’s economy emerged from 
recession to recovery, with the GDP ex-
panding by 1.5 percent year -on-year. 
Deepening macro -economic stability, 
firming energy prices and a recovering 
global economy contributed to the return 
to growth. Non -tradable sectors, primari-
ly transportation, retail and wholesale 
trade, contributed 1.4 percentage points 
(pp) of the 1.5 percent total. Mineral -
resource extraction increased by 1.4 per-
cent, year -on-year, as oil production 
flattened after Russia joined the OPEC+ 
agreement. Growth in manufacturing was 
subdued, partly due to lower public 
spending on defense.  
Domestic demand was the main engine of 
growth. Both household and investment 
demand expanded. Private consumption, 
supported by growing real wages and 
pensions and by a revival of credit to 
households, contributed 1.8 pp to growth. 
Fixed -capital investment in mineral re-
source extraction, transportation, and in 
the financial sector, mainly supported 
investment growth. However, growth in 
manufacturing was not followed by fixed 
capital investment growth. While robust 
external demand supported the country ’s 
exports, a major increase in imports result-
ed in a negative contribution of net ex-
ports to GDP growth.  
The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) contin-
ued to clean up the banking sector: 16 
banks had their licenses revoked due to 
non-compliance with regulations, and another systemically important private 
bank (Promsvyazbank, 1.6 percent share 
by assets) was bailed out by CBR. That 
made it the third bank to be rescued un-
der a new resolution mechanism. As a 
result, the share of state -controlled banks 
in the combined assets of the Russian 
banking system has increased to 66.2 per-
cent, most of them under CBR ownership 
(45 percent of assets). This may affect the 
level playing -field and pose a conflict of 
interest between the CBR ’s regulatory and 
ownership functions.  
In 2017, credit grew both in retail and cor-
porate segments (13.3 percent and 3.8 per-
cent, year -on-year, respectively). The 
share of non -performing loans remained 
stable —but high —at 10 percent as of Janu-
ary 1, 2018, and the overall banking sector 
capital adequacy ratio was also stable at 
12.1 percent. However, compared to other 
emerging markets, both figures point to 
underlying vulnerabilities in Russia.  As of 
January 1, 2018, profitability in the bank-
ing sector declined to 2016 levels, with the 
return on assets and equity at 1 percent 
and 8.3 percent, respectively.  
The CBR continued its gradual approach 
to monetary easing aimed at anchoring 
inflation expectations. A combination of a 
stronger ruble and a bumper harvest, and 
relatively tight monetary and fiscal policy, 
helped reach record -low inflation levels. 
In 2017, consumer inflation reached 3.7 
percent (year -on-year, 12-month average), 
down from 7.1 percent in 2016.  
In 2017, the current account surplus 
reached US$40.2 billion, strengthened by 
an improved trade balance, and was mir-
rored by higher net capital outflows, RUSSIAN

continued its external -debt repayments. 
International reserves increased by 
US$15.4 billion mainly on the back of cur-
rency purchases conducted by the CBR on 
behalf of Ministry of Finance.  
The general government fiscal stance im-
proved in 2017, aided by higher oil prices, 
a recovering economy, an improved tax 
administration, and lower expenditures. 
The general government primary budget 
deficit narrowed from 2.8 percent of GDP 
in 2016 to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2017. Rus-
sia’s new fiscal rule, expected to reduce 
the influence of external volatility on the 
budget and the real exchange rate, comes 
into effect in 2019 and will require fiscal 
consolidation in 2018 -20. Combined with 
the move towards inflation -targeting, it 
underscores the Russian authorities ’ com-
mitment to enhance macro -stability.  
Unemployment declined further in 2017 
to a current 5.2 percent, while real wages 
and pensions increased on the back of 
low inflation. Wage growth was highest 
in the tradable sector and above the rate 
of inflation in the non -tradable and pub-
lic sectors. However, growth in real dis-
posable incomes remained negative, 
driven by a decline in income from other 
sources, including some not directly reg-
istered by statistics.  The poverty rate under the national defini-
tion (population share with income per 
capita below subsistence minimum level of 
9,828 rubles per month in 2016) increased 
marginally from 13.3 percent in 2015 to 
13.4 percent in 2016. The international 
moderate poverty rate (population share 
with per capita consumption below 5.5 
USD/day in 2011 PPP) increased from 2.7 
percent in 2015 to an estimated 3.3 percent 
in 2016, before decreasing to an estimated 
2.9 percent in 2017, as wages and pensions 
increased. The extreme poverty rate re-
mained marginal, below one percent.  
 
 
Outlook  
 
Amid the recovered oil prices, macro sta-
bilization and improved business and 
consumer confidence, we expect Russia ’s 
economy to keep growing. With the ex-
pected price of oil remaining robust at 
US$58, 59 and 60/bbl in 2018, 2019, and 
2020 respectively, our growth estimates 
stand at 1.7 percent in 2018, 1.8 percent in 
2019 and 1.8 percent in 2020.  
The moderate poverty rate is expected to 
fall in 2018 and further through 2019. As 
public spending is constrained, labor in-
come will become the most important  driver of income growth for the bottom 40 
percent. Wage growth and pension indexa-
tion at the inflation level, will support dis-
posable incomes and contribute to a gradual 
decline in the poverty rate. However, many 
households remain close to the poverty line, 
and many individuals lack formal jobs.   
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
External downside risks stem from a sig-
nificant drop in oil prices, a sudden tight-
ening of global financial conditions and an 
expansion of sanctions.  
The performance of the banking sector is 
expected to remain stable. However, the 
bailout of three large private banks points 
to the continuing fragility in the sector, and 
the quality of capital and assets, and related
-party lending will likely remain a concern.  
Weak productivity growth and a shrinking 
labor force will constrain GDP growth. 
Priority policy objectives include limiting 
the role of the state in the economy, in-
creasing investment, and promoting fair 
competition. Also, measures to improve 
the quality of and access to health and 
education services will be needed to pro-
mote longer and more productive work-
ing lives.

74 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
External, one -off factors, such as the dis-
ruption of energy production in early 
2017 and a drought which affected agri-
culture, coupled with the slow imple-
mentation of the government ’s invest-
ment program, led to slower than previ-
ously -projected growth in 2017. Based on 
preliminary assessments from the nation-
al authorities, the economy grew by 1.9 
percent y/y, compared to previously pro-
jected 2.3 percent. Widening external 
deficit, increase in imports and recovery 
in consumption are driving a shift from 
positive to negative contribution of net -
exports to growth.  
Looking at sectors of the economy, both 
services and industry performed well in 
2017, growing by 2.2 and 3.9 percent (in 
real terms), respectively. Construction 
sector started to recover as well (growing 
at 1.8 percent y/y) on the back of recent 
improvements in issuing construction 
permits and lower financing costs as inter-
est rates fell in 2017. On the other hand, 
agriculture sector output is estimated to 
have fallen by 9.5 percent (in real terms), 
compared to 2016, due to the drought.  
Growth in industry and services contribut-
ed to steady labor market performance in 
2017, which improved over 2016. The activ-
ity rate increased to 54 percent in 2017 
(annual average) while the employment 
rate stood at 46.7 percent (compare to 45.2 
percent in 2016), even with unemployment 
edging up only slightly in the fourth quar-
ter of 2017, to reach 14.7 percent.  Average salaries increased by 3.9 percent in nomi-
nal terms in 2017 compared to the year 
before, mainly driven by growth of wages 
in the private sector (increase of 4.5 per-
cent). The average pension was 2.4 per-
cent higher than in 2016.  
Since employment and labor income play 
a strong role in influencing welfare of the 
poor and vulnerable, poverty (living on 
income under $5.5/day in 2011PPP terms, 
the standardized middle-income -country 
poverty line) is estimated to have declined 
from 23.8 percent in 2014, to 23.1 percent 
in 2016, to 22.4 percent in 2017. The in-
crease of salaries and public sector pen-
sions helped household budgets to recov-
er some of the losses from previous fiscal 
consolidation measures. The energy bill 
discount program for vulnerable popula-
tions was expanded in 2017 to mitigate the 
impact of increases in electricity tariffs, as 
part of fiscal reforms. However, a decline 
in agriculture output in 2017 is likely to 
have adverse impacts on rural poverty 
and slow the pace of poverty reduction 
overall. Also, food prices increased (up by 
4.1 percent through December) more than 
the average CPI, in particular over the 
summer months, and likely affecting the 
poor disproportionately. Overall inflation 
reached 3 percent by year -end.   
A good budget performance continued 
throughout 2017 and Serbia ended up 
with a surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP in 
2017. As a result of lower financing needs, 
public debt declined to around 62.5 per-
cent of GDP year end, compared to 74 
percent at the end of 2016. Part of the rea-
son for improved budget performance lies 
in under -execution of the capital budget Table 1 2017

mance improved and unemployment

finances improved significantly and Ser-
bia showed a budget surplus in 2017. 
Poverty is estimated to have declined 
from 23.8 percent in 2014 to 23.1 per-
cent in 2016. Over the medium -term, 
growth is expected to reach 3 -4 percent, 
although risks remain, especially from 
policy reversals related to previous fiscal

terms), which however had a negative 
impact on growth.  
The current account deficit (CAD) al-
most doubled (in euro terms) in 2017 (an 
increase of 94 percent, y/y). This resulted 
in widening trade deficit, as import in-
creased significantly (14.2 percent, y/y, 
or around EUR 2 billion), because of a 
higher import of energy and consumer 
goods. The growing external deficit con-
tinued to be financed by FDI, which in-
creased by 37.5 percent in euro terms. 
FDI covers 135 percent of CAD. Foreign 
currency reserves dropped by 243 mil-
lion euros in 2017.  
The dinar strengthened by 4 percent 
against the euro in 2017, while foreign 
currency reserves decreased by about 
EUR 245 million through December. The 
banking sector remains stable and loans to 
the private sector increased by 3.6 percent 
by end-December (y/y), but mainly due to 
increase in lending to households (up 7.8 
percent, y/y). NPLs declined to 11.1 per-
cent through November, due to more ac-
tive role of banks in selling and writing off 
NPLs. Still, NPLs represent a significant 
problem for state -owned banks.   
Outlook  
 
In 2018 as well as over the medium term, 
growth is expected to pick up, thus helping 
with labor market recovery and poverty 
reduction. Growth is expected to be driven 
by increased investment, stimulated by 
reforms to improve the business climate, 
and the recovery of consumption (as the 
fiscal consolidation program gradually 
expires and private sector wages continue 
to grow). Growth is expected to be around 
3-4 percent over the medium term.  
With economic growth and improvements 
in the labor market, poverty is expected to 
continue its gradual decline.  Poverty, meas-
ured as income below the standardized $5.5/
day 2011PPP line is estimated to continue 
declining to around 21 percent by 2019. As 
part of the government ’s fiscal consolidation 
program, another nominal electricity tariff 
increase in 2018 will be considered, though 
smaller than previous increases. The recent-
ly expanded energy bill discount program 
can help protect vulnerable customers, but 
implementation challenges related to pro-
cessing of applications remain.   
Risks and challenges  
 
As witnessed over the last couple of years, 
Serbian economy is highly vulnerable to 
climate change related events (droughts,  
severe winters, floods, etc.). These external 
shocks might reoccur at any moment in 
the future thus endangering growth pro-
jections. Also, such events often hurt more 
the poor who predominantly live in areas 
less protected from climate -related weath-
er events and who depend more on in-
come earned in agriculture. In addition, 
faster growth requires further effort to-
ward implementation of structural re-
forms: in secondary and tertiary educa-
tion; health financing; privatization of 
remaining state stakes in SOEs and finan-
cial institutions. Also, special attention 
needs to be paid to expanding external 
imbalances. Any delay with implantation 
of these reforms can have a major impact 
on growth outlook. In addition, the poten-
tial distributional impacts of these im-
portant structural reforms may present 
continued challenges to faster poverty 
reduction in the short run.

76 MPO  Apr 18  Recent development  
 
Real GDP growth accelerated to 7.1 percent 
in 2017 from 6.9 percent a year ago. The 
economy was largely fueled by private 
consumption, supported by remittances —
which expanded by about 16 percent 
through nine months of 2017, y -o-y—and 
by net exports, boosted by metallic miner-
als. Investments have also fostered growth, 
despite a deceleration in gross fixed capital 
formation, reflected both more muted FDI 
as well as a base effect from past increases. 
On the supply side, growth was supported 
by both tradable and non -tradable sectors 
with the highest contribution by industry 
followed by agriculture and services.  
Annual consumer price inflation accelerat-
ed to 6.7 percent, slightly above last year ’s 
6 percent, yet within the National Bank ’s 
target of 7±2 percent. Inflationary pressures 
stemmed from the depreciation of the na-
tional currency (about 11 percent during 
the year) which pushed up prices of im-
ported goods along with factors, such as a 
supply -side shock on some food staples 
and increases in utility tariffs. As inflation-
ary pressures and expectations moderated, 
the National Bank lowered the policy rate 
to 14.75 percent in the beginning of 2018.  
Preliminary fiscal outcomes for 2017 sug-
gest that the government adhered to the 
approved medium -term Fiscal Strategy 
2017 -20. The overall fiscal deficit was re-
duced to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2017 from 
3.9 percent in the previous year (excluding 
6.1 percent of GDP related to the financial 
sector bailout). The authorities spent 13.6 percent of GDP in investment, while keep-
ing current spending below 18 percent of 
GDP. The fiscal contraction was attained 
through cuts of non -priority outlays, de-
lays in implementation of further banking 
sector bailouts and contained the overall 
fiscal stance. Construction of the Rogun 
HPP was on full track, facilitated by pro-
ceeds from the Eurobond issuance in late 
2017. The latter increased the level of pub-
lic debt to above 50 percent of GDP, exac-
erbating the country ’s debt -related risks. 
The external position continued to im-
prove on the back of the recovering remit-
tances, net export growth and more gener-
ally improved terms of trade. During the 
first three quarters of 2017, the current 
account balance turned positive to 1.5 per-
cent of GDP compared to a 4 percent defi-
cit in the same period of 2016. Exports 
grew by over 23 percent bolstered by high-
er production of metallic minerals, while 
imports declined by 3 percent in the first 
nine months of 2017, y -o-y. Foreign direct 
investments contracted to 2.1 percent of 
GDP through January-September 2017 (a 
historical low), compared to 2.9 percent of 
GDP in the corresponding period of 2016.  
The financial sector remains partially in-
solvent despite some reduction of non -
performing loans from 47 percent in 2016 
to 35.8 percent by end 2017. The two larg-
est problem banks have downsized sig-
nificantly and now account for about 20 
percent of the banking sector. While 
boosting efforts for asset sales, rehabilita-
tion plans have been submitted to the gov-
ernment’s review. The needed, long -
pending legislative amendments, which 
aimed at enhancing the financial sector TAJIKISTAN

Sources: TajStat, World Bank staff estimates.   Source: World Bank staff estimates.  Tajikistan ’s economy sustained high 
growth in 2017 supported by an improved 
external environment, reflected in net 
exports and the recovering remittances. 
The positive outlook for the Russian econ-
omy, the improving regional environ-
ment, and construction of Rogun hydro-
power plant (HPP) support strong 
growth projections. However, the slow 
pace of reforms, heightened vulnerabili-
ties, and the pending decisions in the 
banking and SOE sectors present down-
side risks. Poverty reduction prospects 
remain positive as remittances continue to 
recover and growth is sustained.  Table 1 2017

review by the government.  
Despite strong growth, poverty fell only 
slightly from 30.3 percent in 2016 to 29.7 
percent by September 2017 with extreme 
poverty stagnant at 14.1 percent of popu-
lation. Income from employment and re-
mittances remain the primary drivers of 
poverty reduction. Lower remittances 
slowed the pace of poverty reduction in 
2014 – H1 2016, but began recovering in 
H2 of 2016, and rebounded throughout 
2017. Poverty was relatively stagnant in 
urban areas during 2015 -16 (hovering at 
around 24 percent) but became more dy-
namic in 2017 by declining to 22 percent. 
During the same period rural poverty fell 
from 36.1 percent in 2014 to 33.1 percent 
in 2017. Food expenditure accounts for 
about 75 percent of total consumption for 
poor households. The Listening -to-
Tajikistan survey identified a noticeable 
decline in the share of households that 
have reduced food consumption to pay 
for other basic needs –  from about 45 per-
cent to about 27 percent between Novem-
ber 2016 to November 2017.  
 
 
Outlook  
 
Tajikistan ’s outlook for the short - to medi-
um term remains positive and is explained  by the improved external environment, 
including prices projected for major ex-
port commodities, and deepening rela-
tionship with neighbors, particularly Uz-
bekistan. Despite the weak banking sec-
tor, growth is expected to be around 6 
percent supported by growing remittanc-
es, construction of large infrastructure 
projects and electricity sales. Inflation is 
forecasted to remain in single digits as-
suming the central bank ’s move to the 
inflation targeting framework improves 
inflation monitoring.  
Over the medium term the fiscal stance is 
expected to remain prudent, in line with 
the deficit ceiling set by the Government ’s 
medium -term fiscal strategy. The fiscal 
deficit is projected at around 3 percent of 
GDP, primarily reflecting investments into 
infrastructure projects and higher debt 
service obligations. The baseline scenario 
does not assume additional budget sup-
port for the banking sector resolution; any 
needed bailout would expand the aug-
mented deficit concomitantly.  
The external balance is expected to deteri-
orate, while remaining below 3 percent of 
GDP affected by second -round effects of 
the remittance -driven consumption recov-
ery and investment -related imports, par-
ticularly for the construction of the Rogun 
HPP. International reserves, which rose to 
5.6 months of imports by the end of Sep-
tember 2017, are expected to decline in line as the construction of the Rogun HPP 
unwind into imports.  
Poverty is projected to fall to about 24 
percent by 2020. Strong growth and recov-
ering remittances and expansion of the 
Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) program 
nationally are expected to push down 
poverty over the medium term.   
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
Risks are tilted to the downside subject to 
external and domestic factors. External 
uncertainties may negatively affect re-
mittance inflows. Domestic vulnerabilities 
include the adequate resolution of prob-
lem banks, growing contingent liabilities 
in public enterprises, and a very slow pace 
of structural reforms, particularly to en-
hance the business climate. The country ’s 
deteriorated debt trend and growing debt 
service obligations pose macro -fiscal chal-
lenges and limit the fiscal space for much 
needed social spending. Any potential 
banking sector bailout and/or second -
round of Eurobonds issuance will sub-
stantially threaten the country ’s fragile 
macroeconomic stability.

78 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
Turkey experienced a strong recovery in 
2017 with growth at 7.4 percent growth, 
stimulated by fiscal measures and a Credit 
Guarantee Fund for SME financing. Con-
sumption accounted for over two thirds of 
growth in this period, and investment start-
ing to pick up. EU recovery helped acceler-
ate exports.  
Strong demand has come at a cost of grow-
ing macroeconomic imbalances. Consumer 
price inflation averaged 11 percent in 2017. 
The current account deficit widened from 
3.8 percent of GDP in 2016 to 5.5 percent in 
2017 amid rising energy prices, high gold 
demand and imports stimulated by strong 
growth. A recovery in net portfolio flows 
helped finance half of the current account 
deficit while FDI inflows declined. Growth 
and import demand accelerated revenue 
collection, keeping the fiscal deficit at 1.9 
percent of GDP in 2017.   
The Central Bank raised the effective poli-
cy rate from 8.3 to 12.75 percent in 2017 
due to price and exchange rate pressures. 
Despite this, inflationary expectations 
remain high. Growth in money stock (M3) 
moderated slightly but remained high at 
16 percent in 2017 in line with strong de-
mand, driven by a 20 percent expansion in 
private sector credit. The Central Bank 
also introduced stricter regulations on 
forex debt for corporates to mitigate risks 
of high forex exposure.  
Poverty in Turkey continued to decline. 
The population with per capita expenditure 
below the poverty line ($5.5 a day in 2011 PPP) fell from 23.1 percent to a low of 9.9 
percent in the 10 years up to 2016. It is esti-
mated to have declined to 9.1 percent in 
2017.  The more recent progress was helped 
by the availability of more jobs, coupled 
with a 30 percent increase in minimum 
wage in 2016.  
Strong growth stimulated the labor market 
in 2017. Unemployment rate decreased by 
2.3 percentage points from 12.7 percent in 
December 2016 to 10.4 percent in December 
2017. Employment increased by 1.6 million 
persons in the same period, mainly driven 
by services (55 percent), industry (19.5 per-
cent) and agriculture (18.3 percent). Labor 
force participation rate for females rose to 
33.5 percent, a 1.3 percentage point annual 
inter -annual increase. Meanwhile, the job-
less rate among the youth fell by 4.8 per-
centage points to 19.2 percent.  
 
 
Outlook  
 
For 2018, economic growth is projected at 
4.7 percent, gradually converging to a 
potential rate of around 4.5 -5 percent. 
Recent surveys point to a moderation in 
consumer demand, weighed down by 
rising costs and declining real wages. Rap-
id credit expansion has increased credit 
risk and raised lending rates, pointing to a 
slowdown in credit growth in 2018.  
Nevertheless, expansionary policies will 
likely in place to stimulate demand to 
maintain growth especially ahead of the 
elections. The 2018 Budget approved in 
December 2018 was supplemented by 
fiscal stimulus measures proposed in  TURKEY

Sources: Turkstat and World Bank staff calculations.  Sources: World Bank. Notes: see Table 2.  Turkey’s strong recovery in 2017 (at 7.4 
percent) came at a cost of widening mac-
roeconomic imbalances. Growth in 2018, 
however, is projected to moderate closer to 
potential, at 4.7 percent. Poverty is fore-
cast to decrease, although at a slower pace 
than previous years. Expansionary poli-
cies will likely in place to stimulate de-
mand, especially ahead of the upcoming 
elections. Key risks include inflation and 
tightening of global financial condi-
tions—all of which could constrain access 
to external finance, raise cost of external 
debt, and weaken the external balance.  Table 1 2017

79 MPO  Apr 18  February 2018 to accelerate investment 
and employment. The latter could poten-
tially raise the budget deficit target fur-
ther. In addition, despite banking sector 
pressures, the Credit Guarantee Fund has 
been extended by a further TL 55 billion 
for 2018.  
Given the above, inflation is expected to 
remain at just above 10 percent in 2018. 
Core inflation, which remained elevated, 
hit double digits in the last months, and 
could push headline inflation further. The 
current account deficit is projected to re-
main high at 5.6 percent of GDP. Despite 
continued export growth driven by con-
tinued recovery in the EU, the import bill 
is likely to remain large, not least due to 
rising commodity prices.  
Poverty is forecast to decrease at a slower 
pace. It is estimated to decline further to 
8.8 percent in 2018 (from 9.1 percent in 
2017). Poverty could decline more rapidly 
if the recently introduced Attraction Cen-
ters Program (ACP) proves effective in 
boosting employment in the poorest re-
gions. The program covers 23 provinces in 
eastern and southeastern Anatolian re-
gions where poverty rates are 3 -4 times 
higher than in the western regions. It aims to create new jobs and investments in less 
developed provinces and reduce high and 
persistent regional inequality.  
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
External vulnerability for Turkey remains 
high. The US monetary policy tightening 
in 2018 could increase the pace and vol-
ume of capital outflows. This increases 
interest and exchange rate risks for Tur-
key’s external debt. The private sector is 
particularly affected as it accounts for 70 
percent of external debt. Although most of 
the debt is of long -term maturity, a weak-
er Lira and costlier external financing 
might adversely impact corporates ’ bal-
ance sheets.  
This raises macro -financial risks. Capital 
adequacy and NPL ratios hover around 16 
percent and 3 percent respectively, alt-
hough total troubled assets are estimated 
to be higher. Exchange rate and interest 
rate risks, together with a slowing econo-
my, all coming on the heels of rapid credit 
expansion, point to a potential deteriora-
tion in banking sector asset quality.  The US announcement on steel and alumi-
num tariffs will affect Turkey – the sixth 
largest seller of steel to the US. The direct 
impact on the trade balance will likely be 
limited, given the overall level of trade 
with the US.  
The current macroeconomic environment 
and projected external conditions will re-
quire monetary and fiscal discipline. Sound 
macroeconomic policies need to be accom-
panied by deeper structural reforms to en-
sure a more sustainable economic growth 
trajectory over the medium term. Steady 
progress in advancing structural reforms 
will be key to restoring investor confidence, 
mitigating vulnerabilities, enhancing 
productivity and supporting growth.  
On the poverty and inequality front, the 
impact of the employment subsidies tar-
geted to disadvantaged populations, and 
the investment incentives focused on lag-
ging regions, remains uncertain, both in 
the short term and in the long run. In addi-
tion, uptake from private employers may 
not reach significant levels, and low -
income candidates may lack skills for jobs 
that become available. Considering these 
constraints, the impact of these policies 
warrants close monitoring.

80 MPO  Apr 18  Recent developments  
 
The official real GDP growth rate accelerat-
ed slightly —from 6.2 percent in 2016 to an 
estimated 6.5 percent in 2017. Growth was 
largely supported by more favorable terms 
of trade, primarily reflecting a recovery in 
global gas prices, which rose by 24 percent 
year -on-year. China remains the largest 
purchaser of Turkmen gas, while a price 
dispute with Iran over gas supplies re-
mains unresolved and has affected export 
revenues. In early 2018, Iran announced 
readiness to file a case with the Interna-
tional Court of Arbitration.  
The domestic retail trade sector grew at an 
annual rate of 19 percent in 2017, as an 
expansion of credit and government trans-
fers supported consumption growth; the 
transport and communications sector 
grew by 11 percent year -on-year, and the 
service sector grew at an annual rate of 9 
percent. However, gross fixed investments 
fell sharply (by almost 9 percent year -on-
year), as flows of both domestic and for-
eign direct investments fell, dampening 
growth in the construction sector. Moreo-
ver, agriculture output increased by a 
mere 5 percent, just below GDP growth, 
suggesting less growth dividends for a 
large share of the population employed in 
the agricultural sector.  
Consumer price inflation hiked from 6.2 
percent in the end of 2016 to 10.4 percent 
by the end of 2017. Inflation was driven by 
the high pressure on the foreign exchange 
(FX) markets, which pushed up the prices 
of imported goods, as well as an upward adjustment of the highly subsidized fuel 
prices, including for utilities, and a 10 
percent rise in public -sector salaries, pen-
sions, and other government payments.  
The current account deficit remained high 
in 2017, although with some improvement 
due to a recovery in global hydrocarbon 
prices and a substantial contraction in 
imports. After falling in 2015 -16, export 
revenues grew by 3.6 percent year -on-year 
in 2017; still not sufficient to close the ex-
ternal gap. In contrast, imports continued 
to decline, falling by 23 percent in 2017. 
The sharp drop in imports was due to 
tighter trade regulations and significant 
pressures on the FX markets as the author-
ities avoided tapping on their buffers, 
restricting liquidity in the FX markets.  
The monetary authorities continued to 
strengthen oversight and control of FX 
operations, and adopted restrictions that 
limited foreign currency withdrawals 
from cash, bank cards, and cross -border 
transactions in 2017. The drying up of FX 
liquidity in the domestic markets suggests 
that a correction of the official exchange 
rate (currently pegged at 3.5 manat per US 
dollar) may need to be considered, along 
with other macroeconomic and structural 
reforms to reduce the external imbalances.  
The Turkmen authorities continued their 
fiscal consolidation efforts and balanced 
the state budget in 2017, compared to the 
1.3 percent deficit in 2016. Compared to 
government plans, revenue collection over
-performed by 1.8 percent in 2017, while 
expenditures underperformed by 3.6 per-
cent, primarily due to cuts in capital 
spending and a gradual elimination of 
welfare subsidies since the last quarter of Table 1 2017

rose by 6.5 percent year -on-year in 2017,

counts improved according to official da-
ta, but inflation surged to double -digits, 
hinting at a possible buildup of imbalanc-
es. The rise of inflation and the gradual 
removal of welfare subsidies for utilities 
has negatively impacted the purchasing 
power of households. The country ’s growth 
outlook remains positive, but risks are 
tilted downwards, given the needed struc-
tural reforms aimed at boosting private -
sector development.

81 MPO  Apr 18  2017. Reportedly, civil servant wages, 
pensions, and other core social transfers 
were protected. It should be noted that the 
state budget does not represent the full 
fiscal picture as an important share of 
public spending is executed via extra -
budgetary funds, including through di-
rected lending. 
Turkmenistan does not release official statis-
tics on household welfare, and little is 
known about most recent labor market de-
velopments. However, the gradual removal 
of subsidies for utilities and rising inflation 
is likely to have affected the real purchasing 
power and living standards of households.  
 
 
Outlook 
 
The baseline scenario assumes a continua-
tion of fiscal consolidation, some moderation 
in the buildup of external imbalances, and 
(sustainable) external debt accumulation to 
help finance the still sizeable (but narrow-
ing) current account deficit. This baseline, 
however, is not without downside risks.  
Turkmenistan ’s outlook will remain high-
ly dependent on hydrocarbon prices and 
the growth performance of its major trad-
ing partner, China. Over the medium 
term, the real GDP growth rate is project-
ed to remain below 7 percent, assuming 
favorable tailwinds (including via the terms of trade) but slow progress on im-
plementing the national strategy ’s struc-
tural reforms aimed at promoting non -
traditional (non -hydrocarbon) exports. 
Inflation would remain high while gradu-
ally returning to single digits, assuming 
further fiscal and monetary tightening.  
The positive outlook on gas prices and the 
robust external demand from China would 
help strengthen the external position. The 
current -account deficit would narrow from 
its peak level in 2016, largely on the back 
of the restrain on merchandise imports 
due to FX constraints. Over the medium 
term, the reduction on imports would also 
follow in case the construction of the Turk-
menistan —Afghanistan —Pakistan —India 
(TAPI) gas pipeline project is delayed. 
More generally, however, a sharp reduc-
tion of imports driven by FX restrictions 
could impinge on domestic price dynam-
ics, and/or curtail the government ’s ability 
to proceed with ongoing investment pro-
jects, harming the growth prospects.  
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
There are both external and domestic 
threats that raise country ’s risk profile. 
External risks include weaker -than -
expected growth in trading partners,  
particularly in China, and an unexpected drop in energy prices, which may exacer-
bate external and domestic imbalances.  
Domestic risks include a low quality and 
rapid credit expansion that may potential-
ly undermine the performance of the fi-
nancial sector, lower -than -expected re-
turns on state -funded projects, and the 
stalling of structural reforms aimed at 
diversifying the economy through private -
sector development.  
An opening of the economy, an improve-
ment in the business regulatory environ-
ment, an acceleration in the corporatiza-
tion and privatization of state -owned en-
terprises, and more investments in human 
capital will be vital to boost private -sector 
development and achieve the goals of the 
medium - and long -term national develop-
ment strategies.  
Limited access to economic opportunities, 
and lack of economic diversification re-
main a major obstacle to inclusive growth, 
especially for households outside the capi-
tal city Ashgabat. Households in rural 
areas are more vulnerable to economic 
downturns and the rising inflation, due to 
factors that include their limited access to 
jobs beyond the agricultural sector. Eco-
nomic diversification (beyond the gas and 
agricultural sectors) with further private 
sector growth would create more econom-
ic opportunities for households, including 
those in rural areas and secondary cities.

Growth remains weak due to key pending 
reforms needed to strengthen investors ’ 
confidence. GDP grew by 2.5 percent in 
2017 (and 2.3 percent in 2016) which is a 
weak recovery since it follows a cumula-
tive 16 percent contraction in 2014-2015. 
Key sectors exhibiting relative strength 
such as manufacturing and domestic trade 
grew over 5 percent in 2017, while con-
struction grew by almost 27 percent. In 
contrast, mining and electricity generation 
contracted due to the trade blockade with 
Donbas. The growth of fixed investment 
has slowed in the second half of the year, 
while FDI remained weak at 2.1 percent of 
GDP in 2017, compared to 5 percent on 
average before the crises. Investor confi-
dence has been affected by the slow pace 
in adopting key reforms and delays in 
completing reviews of the IMF program 
given macroeconomic vulnerabilities and 
uncertainty surrounding the 2019 elec-
tions. CPI reached 13.7 percent at the end 
of 2017, that is significantly higher than 
the NBU target of 8+/ -2 percent, due to 
growth of public sector wages and pen-
sions. As a result, NBU raised its key poli-
cy rate to 17 percent in March 2018 from 
12.5 percent in April 2017. This has in-
creased the cost of funds for local curren-
cy borrowing for both the government 
and the private sector.  
Poverty remains above pre -crisis levels, 
but has registered small decline I in 2017 
due to the modest economic recovery and 
wage growth. The unemployment rate remained steady in the third quarter of 
2017 at 9.4 percent, compared to 9.2 the 
previous year. Real wages grew signifi-
cantly by 19 percent in 2017 in part due to 
higher public -sector wages. This, together 
with real growth of pensions, led to fur-
ther decline in poverty (consumption per 
capita below 5.5 USD/day in 2011 PPP) to 
5.7 percent in 2017 from 6.4 percent in 
2016 and 7.8 percent in 2015. Estimates of 
poverty by the National Statistical Service 
using an absolute poverty line comparable 
over time show much higher incidence 
levels, but a similar modest decline to 51.1 
percent in 2016 from 51.9 percent in 2015.  
The fiscal deficit was within target in 2017 
but spending growth, inflation, and the 
current account deficit remain high. The 
fiscal deficit remained flat and on target at 
2.4 percent of GDP in 2017. However, ex-
penditures were up by 11.7 percent in real 
terms and reached 42.6 percent of GDP 
due to the increase in the minimum wage 
(resulting in higher wages for teachers, 
doctors, and civil servants), as well as 
higher spending on social programs. This 
was balanced by strong revenue growth in 
2017, driven by payroll tax (20 percent in 
real terms, due to the hike in wages), VAT 
(17 percent, due to higher proceeds from 
imports) and personal income tax (16 per-
cent). Public and publicly guaranteed debt 
level remained high at 70.4 percent of 
GDP in 2017. The boost in wages and so-
cial expenditures triggered inflationary 
and current account pressures in 2017. 
The current account deficit was at 3.5 per-
cent of GDP in 2017. FDI remains weak 
and covered 60 percent of the CAD, with 
the remainder financed by public and UKRAINE

Sources: State Statistic Service of Ukraine.  Sources: World Bank. Notes: see Table 2.  Economic growth in 2017 remained mod-
est at 2.5 percent for a second year in a 
row, which is inadequate to reduce elevat-
ed compared to pre -crisis levels. Foreign 
investment and credit to the private sector 
is anemic. Macroeconomic vulnerabilities 
going forward come from significant fi-
nancing needs, fiscal pressures from high-
er public-sector wages and social benefits. 
Completing the pending reforms in ad-
vance of elections in 2019 will be critical 
to mobilize adequate international financ-
ing, maintain macroeconomic stability, 
and bolster investment.  Table 1 2017

Outlook 
 
Bolstering economic growth and address-
ing macroeconomic vulnerabilities will 
require progress on the unfinished struc-
tural reform agenda. Progress on the re-
form agenda and staying on track with 
the IMF program would not only boost 
potential growth, but also provide an 
important signal to strengthen investor 
confidence. This would help stimulate a 
sustained recovery in fixed investment, 
financed by local sources and FDI, and 
boost growth to 4.0 percent by 2019. With 
agriculture and commodities expected to 
remain relatively flat in 2018, the accelera-
tion in growth is expected to come from 
manufacturing, construction, and ser-
vices. Meeting the fiscal deficit target of 
2.5 percent of GDP will require better 
targeting of social programs, rationalizing 
public sector staffing, and implementa-
tion of the recently adopted education 
and health reform laws in a manner that leads to  optimizing the school and hospi-
tal network. Under an alternative scenario 
where reforms do not progress and the 
IMF reviews are not completed, growth is 
likely to remain at 2 percent, or potentially 
fall further if political and social stability 
deteriorates around the 2019 elections.  
The moderate poverty rate (under 5.5 USD/
day) is expected to decline further in 2018 
but remain elevated through 2019. As pub-
lic spending is constrained, labor income 
will become the most important driver of 
increasing incomes for the bottom 40 per-
cent. Some rebound in the real sector, in-
cluding wage growth in the private sector 
will support disposable incomes and help 
the poverty rate to gradually decline. How-
ever, the magnitude of this reduction will 
depend on the growth prospects, especially

Risks and challenges  
 
Elections scheduled in 2019 pose major 
risks in adopting further reforms needed to 
mobilize international financing, address fiscal and financial sector imbalances, and 
promote stronger economic growth.  
Macroeconomic vulnerabilities come total 
fiscal financing needs of $18 billion in 2018 
and 2019 that will require mobilizing 
about $8 billion in external financing. Ad-
ditional fiscal pressures come from the 
rising public-sector wage bill and signifi-
cant spending on social programs, which 
will prove challenging to consolidate 
through the 2019 elections.  
Financial sector weaknesses from high 
nonperforming loans at 55% of total loans, 
weak corporate governance of the domi-
nant state -owned banks, and weak finan-
cial position of the Deposit Guaranty 
Fund not only stand in the way of stimu-
lating investment and growth, but also 
pose significant fiscal risks.  
With real household incomes still below 
pre-crisis levels, continued weak econom-
ic growth of 2 percent going into the 2019 
elections could undermine overall politi-
cal and social support for the broad re-
form effort launched since 2014.  
External risks related to possible decline 
in commodity prices and higher inflation 
in advanced economies that may result in 
higher external trade deficit and cost of 
financing respectively.

GDP growth slowed to 5.3 percent in 2017 
(from 7.8 percent in 2016), led by the de-
celeration in domestic demand.  Total 
investment moderated relative to previ-
ous years, while remaining the main 
growth engine for the economy. This was 
possible thanks to the public investment 
program, which supported a range of 
sectors (transport, utilities, oil and gas 
explorations, and housing) as well as 
public enterprises and private investment 
activity. On the other hand, private con-
sumption declined slightly in real terms 
due to the pickup in CPI inflation, and 
despite a recovery in remittance inflows 
(which rose by 27 percent y/y in dollar 
terms in the first 9 months of 2017, togeth-
er with the strengthening of economic 
activity in Russia).  
The average nominal monetary income 
of the population grew by 12.3 percent 
in 2017, supported by an increase in 
minimum salaries and pensions by 15 
percent in December 2017 (vis -à-vis an 
average inflation of 12.5 percent in 2017, 
in line with the IMF ’s methodology). 
Higher food inflation negatively affected 
mostly urban consumers, particularly 
among the bottom 40 percent households 
for whom food accounts for 61 percent 
of total consumption.  
Uzbekistan mitigated the impact of export 
price declines in 2014 -16 via increased 
export volumes. This trend continued in 
the first half of 2017 —albeit at a decelerat-
ing rate as capacity diminished. Imports also grew, however, on the back of lower 
import prices and the very significant re-
duction in import tariffs implemented in 
September, which resulted in an expand-
ed demand for imported goods. The trade 
balance was in surplus in 2017 (compared 
to a deficit in 2016) thanks to the higher 
commodity prices in the second half of 
2017, and the recovery of food and manu-
facturing exports as the demand of Uzbek-
istan’s trading partners firmed up. Over-
all, the current account surplus strength-
ened further in 2017 compared to 2016, 
owing not only to the stronger trade bal-
ance, but the recovery remittances.  
On September 5, 2017, the Central Bank of 
Uzbekistan (CBU) liberalized the ex-
change rate; the official rate depreciated 
from 4,210 UZS to 8,100 UZS per dollar, as 
it converged with the curb rate; the CBU 
has pursued a managed floating of the 
currency thereafter. The authorities also 
abolished the mandatory sales of a portion 
of firms’ export revenues to the CBU at 
the official exchange rate (“surrender re-
quirements ”), widening the participation 
of the private sector in the foreign ex-
change market. In preparation of the ex-
change rate liberalization, the CBU raised 
the policy rate from 9 to 14 percent in June 
2017, curtailing the strong credit expan-
sion that took place earlier in the year, and 
helping stabilize the banking -loans -to-
GDP ratio at 43.1 percent in 2017 
(compared to 26.6 in 2016). Official figures 
suggest that non -performing loans (NPLs) 
were at 0.79 percent in Q2 2017 and 1.2 
percent at the end of 2017 as per CBU esti-
mates; Moody ’s assessed NPLs at 2.0 -2.5 
percent in August 2017; these could be UZBEKISTAN

Note: Due to the lack of data access, the Bank cannot validate the official figures.  Uzbekistan ’s real growth slowed in 2017, 
led by a deceleration in domestic demand, 
including investment as the key growth 
driver. The medium -term outlook is favor-
able, thanks to the government ’s ambi-
tious reform program (e.g., a liberalized 
exchange rate regime, an enhanced policy 
framework and business climate), and the 
improved external tailwinds. Going for-
ward, ensuring a sound reform imple-
mentation —including by tackling the 
remaining risks —will be key to sustain-
ing inclusive and robust growth and se-
cure job creation.  Table 1 2017

given the currency exposures of key bor-
rowers, particularly public enterprises.  
During 2017 the government sustained a 
robust (but softer) public investment pro-
gram, while cutting back on current 
spending to meet its state budget targets. 
The authorities reduced direct taxes on 
firms and citizens while increasing prop-
erty and resource taxes in an effort to 
achieve revenue neutrality while support-
ing economic activity. The government 
launched a privatization program and 
sold 542 state objects in 2017 with budget 
receipts of 0.3 percent of total budget reve-
nue. The government also drew from its 
significant fiscal buffers (at the Uzbek 
Fund for Reconstruction and Develop-
ment, UFRD, a reserve fund) to cover the 
debts of largest bank and industry public 
enterprises (particularly in the energy 
sector) that were affected by the deprecia-
tion of the official exchange rate. As a re-
sult, the augmented budget (including the 
state and UFRD activity) incurred a larger 
deficit of -3.3 percent of GDP in 2017, rela-
tive to a -0.6 percent of GDP a year earlier.  
The official poverty rate declined slightly 
from 12.5 percent in 2016 to an estimated 
12.4 percent in 2017. Still robust economic 
growth, small business development, and 
social safety net programs have driven poverty reduction in the past. Income 
distribution has become more equitable 
over time and the official Gini coefficient 
fell from 0.39 in 2001 to 0.29 in 2013. 
However, the official unemployment rate 
was 5.8 percent in 2017, higher than 5.2 
percent in 2016.  
 
 
Outlook  
 
Robust growth is expected to continue at 
about 5 percent in 2018 -19, but job crea-
tion may take longer to pick up, as invest-
ments may not return quickly to pre -2017 
levels. Fiscal activity (including through 
UFRD lending) and bank credit are pro-
jected to become less expansionary than in 
the past to help reign on inflation, which 
is expected to remain elevated as liberal-
ized prices continue to adjust. Budget 
spending would be geared towards miti-
gating the impact of the exchange rate 
adjustment on the vulnerable population, 
as well as supporting critical public enter-
prises to gradually converge towards 
greater sustainability and cost -recovery, 
and sustaining the public investment pro-
gram. Monetary policy is expected to be 
tighter than in previous years, also aiming 
at containing inflation from trending up. The current account surplus would nar-
row as imports continue to rise in the face 
of trade liberalization, even as exports 
(both commodities and manufactures) 
maintain a positive growth, and re-
mittances remain solid. Real GDP growth 
is projected to accelerate slowly to 5.5 per-
cent by 2020 as the private business cli-
mate improves on the back of the reform 
process, supporting an acceleration of 
private investment, including FDI.  
While data limitations do not allow for 
poverty projections, we expect that in-
creased income growth and the sustained 
robust net remittances in 2018 will allow 
some progress in poverty reduction over 
the near term.    
 
 
Risks and challenges  
 
Uzbekistan economy ’ upside and down-
side risks are broadly balanced. On the 
upside, there are benign prospects for com-
modity prices, and accelerated private in-
vestment (including as FDI) thanks to the 
authorities ’ b o l d  r e f o r m  a g e n d a .  O n  t h e  
downside, a slower recovery in the Russia ’s 
economy, potential delays in other struc-
tural reforms and higher inflation could 
undermine growth and job prospects.

Abstract  
More and more regulators are worrying about criminals who are 
increasingly using cryptocurrencies for illegitimate activities like 
money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion. The 
problem is significant : even though the full scale of misuse of 
virtual currencies is unknown, its market val ue has been 
reported to exceed EUR 7 billion worldwide. This paper 
prepared by Policy Department A elaborates on this 
phenomenon from a l egal perspective, focusing on the use of 
cryptocurrencies for financial crime, money laundering and tax 
evasion.  It contains policy recommendations for future EU 
standards.

PE 619.024  9 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
More and more regulators are worrying about criminals who are increasingly using cryptocurrencies 
for illegitimate activities like money laundering, terrorist financing a nd tax evasion. The problem is 
significant : even though the full scale of misuse of virtual currenci es is unknown, its market val ue has 
been reported to exceed EUR 7 billion worldwide.1 This research elaborates on this phenomenon, 
focusing on the use of cryptocurrencies for financial crime, money laundering and tax evasion.  
The key issue that needs to b e addressed is the anonymity surrounding cryptocurrencies. This 
anonymity, varying from complete anonymity to pseudo -anonymity, prevents cryptocurrency 
transactions from being adequately monitored, allowing shady transactions to occur outside of the 
regula tory perimeter and criminal organisations to use cryptocurrencies to obtain easy access to 
"clean cash". Anonymity is also the major issue when it comes to tax evasion. When a tax authority 
does not know who enters into the taxable transaction, because of the anonymity involved, it cannot 
detect nor sanction this tax evasion.  
The existing European legal framework is failing to deal with this issue. There are simply no rules 
unveiling  the anonymity associated with cryptocurrencies. However, the tide is changing. The fifth 
revision of the directive on money laundering and terrorist financing, AMLD5, is in the final phase of 
being adopted. AMLD5 includes a definition of virtual currencies and subjects virtual currency 
exchange services and custodian wallet pro viders to customer due diligence requirements and the 
duty to report suspicious transactions to financial intelligence units. The information obtained, can 
also be used by tax aut horities to combat tax evasion.  
AMLD5's definition of virtual currencies is s ufficient to combat money laundering, terrorist financing 
and tax evasion via cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, it is important to closely follow -up on the use 
cases of virtual currencies to ascertain that the definition remains to be a  sufficient one going 
forward.  
When we look at the key players in cryptocurrency markets, we can see that a number of those are 
not included in AMLD5, leaving blind spots in the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing 
and tax evasion. The examples are numerous and include miners, pure cryptocurrency exchanges  
that are not also custodian wallet providers , hardware and software wallet providers , trading 
platforms  and coin offerors. Persons with malicious intent could look up these blind spots. If that 
would happen and  it would appear to have a (material) adverse effect on the fight against money 
laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion, expanding the scope of AMLD5 should be considered.  
With respect to unveiling  the anonymity of users in general (i.e. also outs ide of the context of virtual 
currency exchanges and custodian wallet providers), no immediate action is taken. O nly in its next 
supranational risk assessment,  the Commission will assess a system of voluntary registration of users. 
This approach is not ver y convincing if the legislator is truly serious about unveiling the anonymity of 
cryptocurrency users to make the combat against money laundering, terrorist financing and tax 
evasion more effective. A mandatory registration and a pre- set date as of which i t applies , would be a 
better approach, albeit of course more intrusive. For reasons of proportionality, mandatory 
registration could be made subject  to a materiality threshold.

 10 PE 619.024  For some aspects relating to some cryptocurrencies a ban should be considered. To mind come the 
features that are designed to make cryptocurrency users untraceable. Why is such degree of 
anonymity truly necessary? Would allowing this not veer too far towards criminals? In any event, 
imposing a ban should always be focused on speci fic aspects facilitating the illicit use of 
cryptocurrency too much.  
The European level is appropriate to address money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion 
via cryptocurrencies. Even more appropriate is the international level, as crypto activ ity is not limited 
by the European border. International collaboration is crucial to successfully impose and enforce rules 
on combating money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion. From a regulatory perspective, 
the ongoing G20 attention paid to regulating cryptocurrencies  is therefore welcome.   
As regards blockchain, it would be too blunt to associate blockchain with money laundering, terrorist 
financing or tax evasion. It is just technology, on which a large number of cryptocurrencies run, but 
which is not designed to launder money, facilitate terrorist financing or evade taxes. Blockchain has 
numerous applications throughout the whole lawful economy. It would not be wise to discourage 
future innovations in this respect by submitting blockchain and fintech's exploring its use cases to 
burdensome requirements, simply because of one of the applications using blockchain technology, 
cryptocurrencies, is used illicitly by some. Therefore, blockchain should be left untouched from a 
money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion perspective. The fight against money 
laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion should focus on the illicit use cases of 
cryptocurrencies.

 GENERAL INFORMATION   
 
1.1. Background  
With the growing popularity of the crypto market, the large number of unregulated cryptocurrencies 
(several hundreds), greater attention is now being paid by governments and other stakeholders 
around the world. Illustrative is that the total market capitalisation of the 100 largest cryptocurrencies 
is report ed to exceed the equivalent of  EUR 330 billion globally by early 2018. The total market 
capitalisation of all cryptocu rrencies together in that p eriod peaked at an even higher USD 728 
billion, dropping just thr ee weeks later to approximately  USD 360 billion .2 Regulators are looking at 
whether — and how —  to regulate cryptocurrencies. Up till now there is no univocal view on how to 
do that. In any event, there are compelling reasons why cryptocurrencies should be under more

https://ssrn.com/abstract=3141605 ).   KEY FINDINGS  
• The key issue that needs to be addressed in the fight against money laundering, 
terrorist financing and tax evasion via cryptocurrencies is the anonymity 
surrounding cryptocurrencies.  
• The existing European legal framework is failing to deal with this issu e.  
• The tide is changing: the fifth revision of the directive on money laundering and 
terrorist financing, AMLD5 includes a definition of virtual currencies and subjects 
virtual currency exchange services and custodian wallet providers to customer due 
diligence requirements and the duty to report suspicious transactions to financial 
intelligence units.  
• A number of key players in cryptocurrency markets are not included in the scope of 
AMLD5, leaving blind spots in the fight against money laundering, terroris t 
financing and tax evasion.  
• With respect to unveilin g the anonymity of users in general, no immediate action is 
taken. The Commission will assess only in its next supranational risk assessment a 
system of voluntary registration of users. A mandatory regi stration and a pre -set

the illicit use cases of cryptocurrencies and not on blockchain.

 12 PE 619.024  scrutiny by regulators and supervisors. The threat of price volatility, speculative trading, hack attacks, 
money laundering and terrorist financing all call for stricter regulation.  
This research deep dives into the latter issue. According to many, aside from the instability of 
cryptocurrency prices, these cryptocurrencies must have greater regulatory oversight in order to 
prevent illegal activity and illegitimate use. Aside from the instability of cryptocurrency prices, 
regulators are worrying about criminals who are increasingly using cryptocurrencies for activities 
(trading away from official channels) like fraud and manipulation, tax evasion, hacking, money 
laundering and funding for terrorist activities. The problem is a significant one: even though the full 
scale of misuse of virtual currencies is unknown, its market val ue has been reported to exceed EUR 7 
billion worldwide .3 
1.2. Scope of the research  
Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are a monstrous topic. There are several hundreds of 
cryptocurrencies and the applications of blockchain technology are also numerous. To make this 
research a useful and focused one, we have to narrow it down. To do this, the research attaches to 
multiple connecting factors, defining its scope.  
Firstly, the research is limited to cryptocurrencies and blockchain . This means that other types of assets 
than cryptocurrencies, such as tokens or crypto securities, are not within t he scope of this research. 
We will explain how these assets differ from cryptocurrencies further on. We will also not elaborate on 
derivatives of cryptocurrencies, which are essentially investment instruments. Blockchain will be 
scrutinized to the extent c ryptocurrencies run on this technology. Therefore, blockchain technology 
will not be looked at outside of the context of cryptocurrencies, such as it being used as a technique 
to eliminate intermediaries in the financial, public or other sector. This would  lead to far and exceeds 
the scope of this research.  
Secondly, the research relates to the legal context  of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. The focus is, 
hence, a legal one. This means that we will not elaborate on all the technical aspects – and there are 
many – relating to cryptocurrencies and blockchain. We will only touch upon those to the extent 
necessary to understand the legal context. We will also not take an economic, criminological or any 
other approach than a legal one. We focus on the EU legal context. Therefore, we will not elaborate 
on the international4 or national context, unless it is relevant to better understand the European 
context.  
Thirdly, the legal context is addressed in connection with the implications for  financial crime, money 
laundering and tax evasion. Therefore, we will only scrutinize the legal context of cryptocurrencies 
and blockchain to the extent relevant in connection with financial crime, money laundering and tax 
evasion. We will do this by asse ssing what exactly cryptocurrencies and blockchain are, which 
challenges they bring from the perspective of combating financial crime, money laundering and tax 
evasion, to which extent they are caught by legislation at European level and what could be done to 
improve the legal framework. We will not deep dive into other legal queries than those related to

under tax laws or the protection of investors in cryp tocurrencies (whether or not consumers) under 
financial services laws.5 Although very interesting, these queries exceed the scope of this research.  
Lastly, the research relates to financial crime, money laundering and tax evasion. Financial crime is no 
term of art. Generally speaking, it is used as an umbrella term to designate all sorts of crimes relating 
to the use of finances, such as fraud, theft, tax evasion, bribery, money laundering, terrorist financing, 
etc.. In an EU context, financial crime inclu des inter alia  crimes against the integrity of the financial 
sector, such as money laundering and insider dealing, and crimes against the financial interest of the 
Union, such as fraud. In this research we will not elaborate on all imaginable financial cri mes. On the 
contrary, we will focus on money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion as subtypes of 
financial crime. This focus can be justified for a number of reasons. Firstly, money laundering, terrorist 
financing and tax evasion are at the forefront of the EU’s efforts on combating financial crime .6 
Furthermore, the EU is clearly taking the approach to address cryptocurrency issues via anti -money 
laundering and counter terrorism financing legislation. This research acknowledges that approach 
and  takes the same one. Secondly, leaving theft aside, money laundering, terrorist financing and tax 
evasion are probably the three types of financial crimes that are likely to be most associated with 
cryptocurrencies and blockchain, i.e. when persons commit a crime relating to cryptocurrencies and 
blockchain, the likelihood of that crime being money laundering, terrorist financing and/or tax 
evasion is high. Cryptocurrencies are thought to be very suitable for money laundering, terrorist 
financing and tax eva sion purposes because of their anonymity, cross -borders nature and quick 
transferability7. Thirdly, some crimes simply cannot be committed at this stage via cryptocurrencies. 
Financial crimes such as market abuse and insider dealing are for instance of no relevance for 
cryptocurrencies. Market abuse rules relate to financial instruments traded on a regulated market, a 
multilateral trading facility ( “MTF ”) or an organised trading facility ( “OTF ”). For the application to 
cryptocurrencies this poses two problems: cryptocurrencies are not financial instruments and they 
are not traded on a regulated market, MTF or OTF.  
The research starts with a definition of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. After that, a taxonomy of 
cryptocurrencies will be given on the basis o f an analysis of the 10 cryptocurrencies with the highest 
market capitalisation. This taxonomy will serve as a benchmark throughout this research and will 
allow to verify the adequacy of the existin g and upcoming legal framework.

 14 PE 619.024  1.3. Overview of policy recommendations  for future EU standards 
This study sets out a number of policy recommendations for future EU standards. The main ones are 
outlined below.   
Policy recommendations for future EU standards  
• To unveil the anonymity of cryptocurrency users the EU should consider a system of  
mandatory registration  of users and a pre -set date as of which it applies rather than a system 
of voluntary registration of users . 
• The EU should also think about expanding the list of  “obliged entities ” under AMLD5  with 
those players that are  identified  in this study as the weak spots or have great potential of 
being weak spots, including miners, pure cryptocurrency exchanges that are not also 
custodian wallet providers, software and hardware wallet providers, trading platforms and 
coin offerors.    
• Furthermore, the EU should think about  imposing a specific ban on such aspects surrounding 
cryptocurrencies that are aimed at making it impossible to verify their users  (e.g. mixing) and 
criminally sanctioning these aspects.  
• In addition, the EU could consider extend ing the scope of the Funds Transfer Regulation  to 
make  sure that all relevant information accompanying cryptocurrency transactions is there, 
allowing an adequate money laundering and terrorist financing check. The entities that 
would have to fulfil the requirements could be the intermediaries through which the 
transactions run.  
• In the longer term, the EU should consider developing a tailored and more comprehensive 
framework for cryptocurrencies,  and setting EU standards for cryptocurrencies in line with 
suggestions and recommendations made by the EBA, including license  requirements for 
cryptocurrency service providers . Part of such framework could be to create or impose a 
“middleman”, where the u se of blockchain or other distributed ledger technology has cut out 
such middleman, as this will allow the regulator to attach regulation to an identifiable person, 
thus contributing to enhanced compliance and effective enforcement. 
• With a view of achieving unified regulation of cryptocurrencies  at G20 level, it is 
recommended that the EU leads further initiatives by example.  
• The EU should leave blockchain  be from a money laundering, terrorist financing and tax 
evasion perspective and focus on the illicit u se cases of cryptocurrencies . Blockchain is just 
technology and can have beneficial effects in a wide array of sectors. Its development as such 
should not be discourage d.

 CRYPTOCURRENCIES  AND BLOCKCHAIN  
2.1. What is blockchain?  
2.1.1.  Defining blockchain : a technology with many faces  
Blockchain  is a particular type  or subset  of so-called  distributed ledger technology  (“DLT ”).8 DLT is a 
way of  recording and sharing da ta across multiple data stores (also known as ledgers ), which each 
have the exact same data records and are collectively maintained and controlled by a distributed 
network of computer servers, which are called nodes .9 
Blockchain is a mechanism that employs  an encryption method known as  cryptography10 and uses  (a 
set of ) specific mathematical algorithms to create and  verify a continuously growing data structure  – 
to which data can only be added and from which existing data can not be removed  – that takes the 
form of a chain of “transaction blocks”11, which function s as a distributed ledger.12  
In practic e, blockchain is a technology  with many “ faces ”. It can exhibit different features and covers  a 
wide array of systems that range  from being  fully open and permissionless, to  permissioned13: 
• On an  open , permissionless blockchain, a person  can join or leave the network at will, without 
having to be  (pre-)approved by any (central) entity.14 All that is needed to join the network and 
add trans actions to the ledger is a computer on which  the relevant software  has been installed . 
There is no central owner  of the network and software, and identical copies of the ledger are 
distributed to all the nodes in the network.15 The vast majority of  cryptocurrencies  currently in 
circulation  is based on permissionless blockchain s (e.g. Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin,  …).   
• On a permissioned blockchain , transaction validators (i.e. nodes)  have to be pre -selected by a 
network  administrator (who sets the rules for the ledger)  to be able to join the network.16 This 
allows, amongst others,  to easily verify the identity of the network participants .17 However, at the 
same time  it also requires network participants to put trust in a central coordinating entity  to 
                                                             
8  Another example of distributed ledger technology is “ directed acyclic graph ”, the underlying technology of the IOTA -platform (see 
below). See also: M.  VAN DE LOOVERBOSCH , “Crypto -effecten: tussen droom en daad”, TRV -RPS 2018, 193, footnote 2.

the ledger can only be accessed by the nodes that are participating in the network and different rules apply on who can upda te the 
state of the ledger). Inter alia: P.  WITZIG  and V. SALOMON , “Cutting out the middleman: a case study of blockchain -induced

 16 PE 619.024  select reliable  network  nodes .18 In general, permissioned blockchains can be  further divided into 
two subcategories. On the one hand, there are open or public permissioned blockchains , which can 
be accessed and viewed by anyone, but where only authorised network participants  can generate 
transactions and/or update the state of the ledger.19 On the other hand, there are closed or 
“enterprise” permissioned blockchains20, where access is restricted and where only the network 
administrator can generate transactions and update the state of the ledger.21 What is important 
to note is that j ust like on an open  permissionless blockchain, transactions on a n open 
permissioned blockchain can be validated and  executed without the intermediation of a  trusted  
third -party. Some cryptocurrencies, like Ripple  and NEO  utilise  public  permissioned blockchains.22      
2.1.2.  How a blockchain works : the basics  
a. The blockchain is a distributed database  
In simple terms , the blockchain can be thought of as a distributed database . Additions to this  
database are initiated by one of the members (i.e. the network  nodes), who creates a new “block” of 
data, which can contain al l sorts of information . This new block is then broadcasted to every party in 
the network in an encrypted fo rm (utilising cryptography) so that the transaction details  are not 
made public .23 Those in the network (i.e. the other network nodes) collectively determine the block’s 
validity in accordance with a pre -defined algorithmic validation method, commonly referred to  as a 
“consensus mechanism ”24. Once validated, the new “block ” is added to  the blockchain , which 
essentially results in an update of the transaction ledger  that is distributed across the network .25  
In principle, this mechanism can be used for any kind of value transaction and can  be applied to any 
asset that can be represented in a digital form26. We illustrate this in  Figure 1 below.   
b. Transaction “blocks”  are signed with a digital signatur e using a  private  key  
Every user  on a blockchain  network  has a set of two keys. A private key, which is used to create a 
digital signature  for a transaction, and a public key, which is known to everyone on the network.  A

PE 619.024  17 public key has two uses: 1) it serves as an address on the blockchain network; and 2) it is used to verify  
a digital signature  / validate the identi ty of the sender.27     
On the Bitcoin blockchain, this translates into the following example. Suppose that Anna wants to 
send 100 Bitcoins to Jeff, then  first of all  she will  have to digitally sign this transaction using her 
private key  (which is only known to her). She will  have  to address  the transaction to Jeff’s public key, 
which is Jeff’s address on the  Bitcoin network. Next, the transaction, which will be collated into a 
“transaction block ”, will have to be  verified  by the nodes within the Bitcoin network. Here, Anna’s 
public key will be used to verify her signature. If Anna’s signature is valid, the network will process the 
transaction, add the block to the chain and transfer 100 Bitcoins from Anna to Jeff.  
A user’s public and private key s are kept  in a digital  wallet  or e -wallet . Such wallet  can be stored  or 
saved  online (online storage is often referred to as  “hot storage”) and/ or offline (offline storage is 
commonly referred to as “cold storage”).28

c. Bye-bye middle man ? 
One of the key advantages of blockchain technology is that it allows to simplify  the execution of  a 
wide array of transactions that would normally require the intermediation of a  third party  (e.g. a 
custodian,  a bank,  a securities settlement system , broker -dealers , a trade repository, …). In essence, 
blockchain  is all about decentraliz ing trust and enabling decentraliz ed authentication of 
transactions.29 Simply put , it allows to cut out  the “ middle man”.30  
In many cases this will like ly lead to efficiency gains . However, it is important to underscore that it 
may also expose interacting parties to certain risks that were previously managed by these

of 2017 titled  Distributed ledger technology in payment, clearing and settlement31, that the adoption of  
blockchain  technology could  introduce new liquidity risks.32 More in general it seems that when an 
intermediary functions as a buffer against important risks, such as systemic risk, he cannot simply be 
replaced by blockchain technology.      
2.1.3.  The blockchain consensus mechanisms  
In principle, any node within a blockchain  network can propose the  addition of  new information  to 
the blockchain . In order to validate whether this  addition of information  (for example a transaction 
record) is legitimate, the nodes have to reach some form of agreement.  Here a “consensus 
mechanism ” comes into play . In short , a consensus mechanism is a predefined spec ific 
(cryptographic ) validation method  that ensures a correct sequencing of transactions  on the 
blockchain .33 In the case of cryptocurrencies, such sequencing is required to  address  the issue  of 
“double -spending” (i.e. the issue that one and the same  payment instrument or  asset can be 
transferred more than once if transfers are not registered and controlled centrally34).  
A consensus mechanism can be structured in a number of ways. Hereinafter, the two best -known  – 
and  in the context of cryptocurrencies also most commonly used –  examples of consensus 
mechanisms will be briefly  discussed: the Proof of Work (“ PoW”) mechanism and the Proof of Stake 
(“PoS ”) mechanism.     
a. Proof of Work (PoW)  
In a PoW system, network participants have to solve  so-called  “cryptographic puzzles ” to be allowed 
to add new “blocks ” to the blockchain . This puzzle -solving process is commonly referred to as 
“mining”.35 In simple terms, these  cryptographic  puzzles are made up out of  all information  previously  
recorded on the blockchain and a new set of transactions to be added to the next “ block ”.36 Because  
the input of each puzzle becomes larger over time (resulting in a more complex  calculation) , the PoW  
mechanism requires a vast  amount of  computing resources, which consume a  significant amount of 
electricity.37

37  For exampl e, the current estimated annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin (one of the best- known examples of a cryptocurrency 
based on a PoW mechanism) is equivalent to the annual electricity consumed in the Czech Republic. Inter alia:

PE 619.024  19 If a network participant (i.e. a node) solves a cryptographic puzzle, it proves that he  has completed 
the work, and is rewarded with digital form of value (or in the case of a cryptocurrency, with a newly 
mined coin).  This reward serves as an incentive to  uphold the network .38  
The cryptocurrency Bitcoin is based on a PoW consensus mechanism. Other examples include 
Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, etc.39   
b. Proof of Stake (PoS)  
In a PoS  system, a transaction validator (i.e. a network node) must prove ownership of a certain asset 
(or in the case of cryptocurrencies, a certain amount of coins) in order to participate in the  validation  
of transactions. T his act of validating transactions is  called  “forging ”40 instead of “mining”. For 
example, in the case of cryptocurrencies , a transaction validator will have to prove his  “stake” (i.e. his  
share) of all coins in existence to be allowed to validate a transaction. Depending on how many coins 
he holds, he will have a higher chance of being the one to  validate  the next  block  (i.e. this all has to  do 
with the fact that he has greater seniority within the network earning him a  more  trusted position ).41 
The transaction validator is paid  a transaction fee for his validation services  by the transacting 
parties .42  
Cryptocurrencies such as Neo and Ada (Cardano) utilize  a PoS consensus mechanism43.  
c. Other mechanisms  
The PoW and PoS mechanisms are far from the only consensus mechanisms  currently in existence.44  
Other examples include  proof of service , proof of elapsed time  and proof of capacity. A further 
analysis of these mechanisms falls outside the scope of this study.  
2.1.4.  Blockchain  technology  can have  many applications  
While b lockchain  technology  is often as sociated with  digital or virtual currency schemes, payments  
and  financial services , its scope is  much wider. Blockchain can  theoretically  be applied in a large  
variety of  sectors45 (e.g. trade and commerce, healthcare, governance, …). In addition , it has 
numerous  potential applications. It could have an impact on the pledging of collateral, on the 
registration of shares, bonds and other assets46, on the transfer of property tiles, on the operation of 
land registers47, etc. An analysis of t hese applications falls outside the scope of this study.

 20 PE 619.024  As pointed out above, this study will  only  touch upon the subject of  blockchain  technology  where 
this is meaningful  for the research on cryptocurrencies and can be deem ed relevant  from the 
perspective of combating money laundering, terrorist financing and/or  tax evasion.     
2.2. What are cryptocurrencies?   
2.2.1.  Introduction  
Establishing a definition  of cryptocurrencies  is no easy task. Much like  blockchain, cryptocurrencies  
has become  a “buzzword ” to refer to a wide array of  technological developments  that utilise a 
technique  better  known as cryptography. In simple terms, cryptography is the  technique of 
protecting information by transforming it (i.e. encrypting it) into an unreadable format that can only 
be deciphered (or decrypted) by someone who possesses a secret key.48 Cryptocurrencies such as  
Bitcoin, are secured via this technique using an ingenious system of public and private digital keys.49  
Hereinafter we try  to give a suitable definition of cryptocurrencies on the basis of a critical analysis of 
the definitions already developed by various concerned policy makers at European and international 
leve l.50  
2.2.2.  The policy makers: ECB, IMF, BIS, EBA, ESMA , World Bank  and FA TF 
Since the emergence of Bitcoin in 200951, the subject  of cryptocurrencies has been scrutiniz ed by 
various  policy makers , whom have each touched upon the subject in  a different way .   
a. ECB  
The European Central Bank (“ ECB”) has classified cryptocurrencies as a subset of virtual currencies. In a 
report on Virtual Currency Schemes  of 2012, it defined such currencies  as a form of unregulated digital 
money, usually issued and controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members 
of a specific virtual community .52 
It further clarified that  three types of virtual currencies can be distinguished d epending on the 
interaction with traditional currencies and the real economy :  
i. virtual currencies  that can only be used in a closed virtual system, usually in online games 
(e.g. World of Warcraft Gol d);  
ii. virtual currencies  that are unilaterally linked to the real economy: a conversion rate exists to 
purchase the currency (with traditional money) and the purchased currency can subsequently 
be used to buy virtual goods and services (and exceptionally al so to buy real goods and 
services) (e.g. Facebook Credits);  
iii. virtual currencies  that are bilaterally linked to the real economy: there are conversion rates 
both for purchasing virtual currency as for selling such currency; the purchased currency can 
be use d to buy both virtual as real goods and services.53

53  Ibid. , 13-19. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain  
 
PE 619.024  21 Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are virtual currencies of the latter type: they can both be bought 
with traditional money as  sold against traditional money, and they  can be used to buy both digital 
and real goods and services.54   
In a more recent report of 2015 titled  Virtual Currency Schemes – a further analysis , the ECB  put forward 
a “second ”, and largely updated, definition of virtual currencies . It defined  virtual currencies as  digital 
representations  of value, not issued by a central bank, credit institution or e- money institution, which 
in some circumstances can be used as an alternative to money .55 It also clarified  that cryptocurrencies , 
such as Bitcoin,  constitute a decentraliz ed bi -directional (i.e. bilateral) virtual currency.56  
b. IMF 
Like the ECB, t he International Monetary Fund (“ IMF”) has categorised  cryptocurrencies as a subset of 
virtual currencies, which it defines  as digital representations of value, issued by private developers and 
denominated in their own unit of account .57 According to the IMF, the concept  of virtual currencies 
covers  a wider array of ‘currencies’, ranging from simple IOUs  (“Informal certificates of debt” or “ I owe 
you’s”)  by issuers (such as Internet or mobil e coupons and airline miles), virtual currencies backed by 
assets such as gold,  and cryptocurrencies  such as Bitcoin .58  
c. BIS 
The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures  (“CPMI ”), a body  of the Bank for International 
Settlements  (“BIS”), has qualified  cryptocurrencies as digital currencies  or digital currency schemes.59 
These schemes are said to  exhibit the following key features: 
i. they are assets, the  value  of which is  determined by supply and demand, similar in concept to 
commodities such as gold , yet  with  zero intrinsic value; 
ii. they make u se of distributed ledgers to allow remote peer -to-peer exchanges of electronic 
value in the absence of trust between parties and without the need for intermediaries ; and 
iii. they are not operated by any specific individual or institution .60 
d. EBA 
The European Banking Authority ( “EBA ”) has suggested to refer to  cryptocurrencies  as virtual 
currencies , which it defines61 as digital representation s of value that are  neither issued by a ce ntral

currencies”, because, while recognising that the term is not perfect, the term is used widely and reflects the concept that t hese are assets that 
are represented in digital form. Previous CPMI reports used the term “virtual currencies”, reflecting their existence in a virtual rather than 
physical form; virtual currencies in particular are prevalent in certain online environments. Moreover, these schemes are frequently referred to 
as “cryptocurrencies”, reflecting the use of cryptography in their issuance, and in the validation of transactions ”. 
60  Ibid. , 4-7.  
61  It should be noted that EBA has indicated that the usage of the term ‘currency’ ma y be misleading in some cases. It has however opted 
to use this term due to its common public usag e at the time (i.e. 2014). See:  EBA, “EBA Opinion on ‘virtual currencies’”, 4 July 2014,

persons as a means of exchange and can be transferred, stored or traded electronically.62 
e. ESMA  
The European Securities and Markets Authority (“ ESMA ”) has recently also referred to 
cryptocurrencies as virtual currencies , in a pan -European warning issued in cooperation with t he 
European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority ( “EIOPA ”) and the EBA.63 Fully in line with  
the EBA’s definition, virtual currencies  are defined  as digital representations  of value that are neither 
issued nor guaranteed by a central b ank or public authority and do  not have the legal status of 
currency or money .64 
f. World Bank  
The World Bank has  classified cryptocurrencies as a subset of digital currencies, which it defines as 
digital representations of value that are denominated in their own unit of account, distinct from e-
money, which is simply a digital payment mechanism, representing and deno minated in fiat money .65  
Contrary to  most other policy makers, the World Bank  has also  defined  cryptocurrencies  itself  as 
digital currencies that rely on cryptographic techniques to achieve consensus .66 
g. FATF  
Like many other policy makers, t he Financial Action Task Force (“ FAT F”) has approached 
cryptocurrencies as a subset of virtual currencies, which it defines as digital representation s of value 
that can b e digitally traded and function as (1) a medium of exchange; and/or (2) a unit of account; 
and/o r (3) a store of value, but do  not have  legal tender status (i.e., when tendered to a creditor, are  a 
valid and legal offer of payment) in any jurisdiction.67  
It further suggests that virtual currencies  can be divided  into two basic types:  
i. convertible virtual  currencies  that have an equivalent value in real currency and can be 
exchanged back -and -forth for real currency ; these virtual currencies can be o f a centralised or 
a decentraliz ed nature (i.e. they can either have a central administrating authority that 
controls the system or no central oversight at all);  and 
ii. non-convertible virtual currencies that are specific to a particular virtual domain or world (e.g. 
a Massively Multiplayer Online Role -Playing Game like World of Warcraft ), and under the rules 
governing its use, cannot be exchanged for fiat currency.68

PE 619.024  23 Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are virtual currencies of the first type, that can, according to the FAT F, be 
defined as math -based, decentraliz ed convertible virtual currencies  that are protected by 
cryptography.69 
h. Summary  
The main conclusion that can  be drawn from the different perspectives set out  above, is that there is  
no generally accepted definition of the term cryptocurrencies available in the regulatory space . Even 
more,  most policy makers have refrained  from defining the term altogether. Among st those cited 
above, o nly the World Bank and the FAT F have  put forward a clear- cut definition. It  is clear , however,  
that most policy makers approach  cryptocurrencies as a subset or a form of virtual or digital 
currencies.  
If we try to summarize all the above definitions, a good summary could be that a c ryptocurrency  is “a 
digital representation of value  that  (i) is intended to constitute a peer -to-peer  (“P2P”)  alternative to 
government -issued legal tender , (ii) is used as  a general -purpose medium of exchange ( independent of any 
central bank ), (iii) is secured by a mechanism known as cryptography and  (iv) can be converted into legal 
tender  and vice versa ”.  
Hereinafter we will shed some light on the concept of cryptocurrencies (or coins; we will use both 
terms interchangeably  hereinafter), more in particular the dividing line with other, neighboring 
concepts, which should nevertheless be distingu ished  from cryptocurrencies.  
2.2.3.  Cryptocurrencies – Tokens – Cryptosecurities  
The term c ryptocurrencies is in practice  often  erroneously  used in a  very broad  sense .70 As will be 
shown below , it should be distinguished from  both tokens and cryptosecurities.     
a. Cryptocurrencies – Tokens  
Firstly , cryptocurrencies should be distinguished from  cryptographic  “tokens” , which  offer a  
functionality other than and beyond that of a general -purpose  medium of exchange. Tokens are 
issued in the framework of an Initial Token Offering or “ ITO”71 to raise funds for a given project or 
enterprise. They constitute  a novel  class of crypto -assets (i.e. digital assets recorded on a distributed 
ledger, secured by cryptography72) which  embody some sort  of claim against an entity (or against its 
cash flows, assets, residual v alue, future goods or services, …) that arises from the use of blockchain 
technology.73  
Some tokens resemble traditional instrum ents such as shares or bonds and are commonly referred to 
as “security tokens”  or “investment tokens”.74 Other tokens grant their holders (future) access t o 
                                                             
69  Ibid. , 5.  
70  In some cases, the term “Cryptocurrency” could even be called a misnomer. See: A.  ZAINUDDIN , “Differences Between Cryptocurrency 
Coins and Tokens”, 2017, https://masterthecrypto.com/differences -between -cryptocurrency -coins -and-tokens/ .  
71  We note that legal literature and popular media commonly refer to these fundraising events as Initial Coin Offerings or ICOs (see for 
exampl e: J. ROHR and A. WRIGHT , “Blockchain -Based Token Sales, Initial Coin Offerings, and the Democratization of Public Capital 
Markets”, October 2017 (electronically available via https://ssrn.com/abstract=3048 104); D. ZETZSCHE , R. P. BUCKLEY , D. W. ARNER  and L. 
FÖHR, “The ICO Gold Rush: It‘s a scam, it‘s a bubble, it‘s a s uper challenge for regulators”,  November 2017 (electronically available via 
https://ssrn.co m/abstract=3072298 ); D. FLOYD , “$6.3 Billion: 2018 ICO Funding Has Passed 2017's Total”, April 2018, 
https://www.coindesk.com/6 -3-billion -2018 -ico-funding -already -outpaced -2017/ ). If we take the position that tokens actually differ 
from coins, then the term Initial Token Offering or ITO is a more appropriate term for future reference.

acquire certain products or services, yet they  do not constitute a general -purpose medium of 
exchange, simply because they can  generally  only be used on the token platform itself.75  
b. Cryptocurrencies – Cryptosecurities  
Seco ndly, c ryptocurrencies should also be distinguished from  a concept  that has recently been 
referred to as  “cryptosecurities” .76 In short, i t has been argued that blockchain technology could also 
be used  to register, issue and transfer regular shares and other corporate securities, so that the 
capitalisation table of a company is always accurate and up- to-date.77 Because this technological  
process would be secured with cryptography, it has been suggested that these  securities be defined  
as cryptosecurities.  
The only  connection between this newly developed concept “ cryptosecurities”  and c ryptocurrencies , 
is that they both utiliz e blockchain technology.  
2.2.4.  Cryptocurrencies – Blockchain  
Cryptocurrencies  and blockchain have become hot topic s in the last couple of years . Whilst  the two 
are often referred to in the same sentence and are clearly linked to each other, one  should never  
mistake one  for the other. Blockchain  is a type  of distributed ledger technology that  forms the 
backbone of the crypto -market. It is the technology behind  the large  variety  of c ryptocurrencies 
currently in circulation. Its scope and field of application are , however,  not limited thereto . As set out 
above, blockchain  can be applied in various sectors  and can have a wide array of  application s. It is 
important to draw a clear line between  these  applications  and cryptocurrencies, which are but one 
specific application of blockchain technology . Against this background , regulators need not fear of 
stifling innovation  when tackling  the subject of  cryptocurrencies .   
2.3. Who are the players involved ?  
The cryptocurrency market  is a new  playing field where different actors each pla y a particular role.  To 
shed some more light  on how the market works, and without attempting to be exhaustive, we will 
hereinafter fu rther  identify  the key players.   
                                                             
75  It should be noted that various studies of the token market have put forward taxonomies of tokens. Not all of these taxonomies 
coincide, yet the silver thread that appears to run through all of them is that, at the very least, a distinction is to be ma de between 
“security” or “investment tokens” on the one hand and “uti lity tokens” on the other hand. See inter alia : D. ZETZSCHE , R. P. BUCKLEY , D. W.

PE 619.024  25 2.3.1.  Cryptocurrency users  
A first, and very  important, player is the “ cryptocurrency u ser”. A cryptocurrency u ser is a natural 
person or legal entity who obtains coins to use them  (i) to purchase  real or virtual goods or services 
(from  a set of specific merchants78), (ii) to  make  P2P payments, or (iii)  to hold them  for investment 
purposes (i.e. in a speculative manner).79     
Without trying to be exhaustive, a  cryptocurrency u ser can obtain his coins in a number of ways80: 
• Firstly, he can simply  buy his coins  on a cryptocurrency e xchange using fiat money or another 
cryptocurrency ; 
• Secondly, he can buy his c oins directly from ano ther cryptocurrency u ser (i.e. through a trading 
platform – this form  of exchange is often referred to as a “P2P exchange ”);  
• Thirdly , if a c ryptocurrency is based on a PoW consensus mechanism, he can mine a new c oin (i.e. 
participate in the validation of transactions  by solving of a “ cryptographic puzzle ” and be 
rewarded a new c oin81);  
• Fourthly , in some cases he  can obtain his  coins  directly from  the coin offeror, either as part of a 
free initial offering  of c oins (e.g. on the Stellar network  Lumens (XLM) are being given away for 
free82) or in the framework of a crowd  sale set- up by the coin offeror (e.g. a large bulk of ether ( cf. 
Ethereum ) was sold in a  crowdsale to cover certain development costs83);  
• Fifthly , if he sells goods or services  in exchange for c ryptocurrency , he can also receive c oins as a 
payment for those  goods or services;  
• Sixthly , in case of a “hard fork”84 of a coin’s blockchain, he will automatically obtain an amount of 
the newly created coin; and 
• Finally, he can receive c oins as a gift or donatio n from another cryptocurrency u ser. 
2.3.2.  Miners  
A second player  is the “miner ” who participate s in validating transactions on the blockchain by 
solving a “cryptographic puzzle”.  As explained  above , the process of mining relates to 
cryptocurrencies that  are based on a PoW consensus mechanism. A m iner  supports the network by 
harnessing computing power to validate transactions and is rewarded with newly min ed c oins  (i.e. 
through an automatic decentraliz ed new issuance).85 Miners can be cryptocurrency u sers, or, more 
commonly, parties who have made a new business out of mining c oins to sell them for fiat currency  
                                                             
78  At present, only a limited number of (online) merchants accepts payments in Cryptocurrencies. See  for example for the Cryptocurrency 
Litecoin: https://litecoin.com/services#merchants .

miners  to bundle computing power.87  
At present, the risks associated with so -called  “mining businesses” appear to be underestimated. We 
will further elaborate on this below.88  
2.3.3.  Cryptocurrency exchanges  
A third  group of  key players are the  so-called  “cryptocurrency e xchanges ”. Cryptocurrency 
exchanges  are persons or entities who offer excha nge  services to cryptocurrency u sers , usually  
against payment of  a certain fee (i.e. a commission). They allow c ryptocurrency users to sell their c oins 
for fiat currency or buy new c oins with  fiat currency.89 They usually function both as a bourse and as a 
form  of exchange office.90 Examples of well- known cryptocurrency e xchanges are: Bitfinex91, HitBTC92, 
Kraken93 and  Coinbase GDAX94.95  
It is important to note that some exchanges  are pure  cryptocurrency e xchanges, which means that 
they only accept payments in other c ryptocurrencies , usually Bitcoin (for example Binance96), whilst 
others also accept  payments in fiat currencies such as US dollar or  Euro  (for example Coinbase) . 
Furthermore, many cryptocurrency exchanges only allow their users to buy a particular select ion of 
coins.    
It should also be noted  that many cryptocurrency exchanges (i.e. both  regular and pure 
cryptocurrency exchanges) operate as c ustodia n wallet providers97 (for example Bitfinex).   
In general  cryptocurrency exchanges  offer  their users  a wide array of payment options , such as wire 
transfers, PayPal  transfers , credit cards  and other coins.98 Some cryptocurrency e xchanges also 
provide statistics on the c ryptocurrency market ( like trading  volumes and volatility of the c oins  
traded99) and offer conversion services to merchants who accept payments in c ryptocurrencies.

PE 619.024  27 2.3.4.  Trading p latforms  
In addition to cryptocurrency exchanges, so-called “ trading p latforms ” also play an important role  in 
the exchange of c ryptocurrencies  (and , most notably, allow cryptocurrency u sers to buy c oins with  
cash) . Trading platforms  are market places  that bring together different cryptocurrency u sers  that are  
either looking to buy or sell c oins,  providing them with a platform on which they can  directly  trade  
with each other (i.e. an  “eBay ” for c ryptocurrencies ).100  
Trading p latforms are sometimes referred to as “P2P exchanges”  or “decentraliz ed exchanges” .101 
They differ from cryptocurrency exchanges in a number of ways.  First and foremost, they do not buy 
or sell c oins themselves.102 Secondly , they are not run by an entity or company that oversees and 
processe s all trades, but they are operated exclusively by software  (i.e. there is no central point of 
authority) .103 Trading p latforms simply connect a buyer with a seller, allowing them  to conduct a deal, 
online, or even locally in-person (i.e. a face- to-face trade, often executed in  cash). A well- known 
example of a trading p latform for Bitcoins is LocalBitcoins104.  
2.3.5.  Wallet p roviders  
Another group of  key players are the  so-called  “wallet p roviders ”. Wallet p roviders are  those  entiti es 
that provide c ryptocurrency u sers digital wallets or e -wallets  which are used for holding, storing and 
transferring coins.105 Simply put, a wallet holds a cryptocurrency u ser’s cryptographic keys  (see 
above) . A wallet p rovider typically translates a cryptocurrency u ser’s transaction history into an easily 
readable format, which looks m uch like a  regular  bank account .106  
In reality, there are several  types of wallet p roviders107: 
• Hardware wallet p roviders that provide cryptocurrency u sers with specific hardware solutions to 
privately store their cryptographic keys (e.g. Ledger Wallet108, …);  
• Software wallet p roviders that provide c ryptocurrenc y users with software applications which 
allow them to  access the network , send and receive c oins and  locally  save their cryptographic 
keys (e.g. Jaxx109);  
• Custodia n wallet p roviders that take  (online) custody of a  cryptocurrency u ser’s cryptographic keys  
(e.g. Coinbase110).

 28 PE 619.024  2.3.6.  Coin inventors  
There are  also  those players who are referred to as “ coin inventors” . Coin i nventors  are individuals or 
organiz ations who have developed the technical foundations  of a c ryptocurrency  and set the  initial  
rules for its use.111 In some cases their  identity  is known (e.g. Ripple, Litecoin, Cardano ), but ever so  
often they  remain unident ified (eg. Bitcoin, Monero). Some remain involved in  maintaining and 
improving the c ryptocurrency’s code and underlying  algorithm (in principle  without  administrator’s 
powers ), whilst others simply disappear (e.g. Bitcoin).112  
2.3.7.  Coin offeror s 
A final group of  key player s to be distinguished are the “ coin offerors ”. Coin offerors are individuals 
or organiz ations that offer coins to cryptocurrency users  upon the coin’s initial release , either against 
payment (i.e. through a crowdsale) or at no charge  (i.e. in th e framework of a specific (sign- up) 
program (e.g. Stellar –  see below)) , normally  to fund the coin’s further development or boost its initial 
popularity.  
The coins these coin offerors  offer to cryptocurrency users are created or pre- mined prior to the coin’s 
official release  / the coin’s inception. Coins that are distributed  this way are either partially  pre-mined 
or pre-created  (i.e. cryptocurrency users can still generate more coins after the release), or are fully 
pre-mined or pre- created. In the latter case the coin offeror usually retains a large portion of the coins  
(e.g. this is the case with Stellar) .  
It is important to note that not all coins have an identifiable coin offeror, nor are all coins pre- mined 
or is its full supply pre -created. 
A coin offeror can be the same person as the coin inventor, or another individual or organization.

 CLASSIFYING  CRYPTOCURRENCIES 
3.1. Scoping the Crypto -Market  
After having known a steady growth over the last couple of years, the market for c ryptocurrencies has 
skyrocketed in 2017, appreciating more than 1,200% .113 At present, there are several hundreds of 
coins in circulation  (with a total mark et capitalisation of well over  EUR 300 billion )114, and more 
continue to pop up on a regular basis. In order to fully grasp this emerging market and carry out a 
mean ingful study, we have opted to  first analyse  the key properties  of the best- known 
cryptocurrency Bitcoin and then  tackle the main  features of a sel ected number of alternative 
cryptocurrencies , better known as  “Altcoins ”.  
Altcoins  are all coins that are an alternative to Bitcoin.115 In short, there are two types of Altcoins:  
• Altcoins that are built using  Bitcoin’s original  open -source  protocol , with  a number of  changes to 
its underlying codes116, conceiving  a new c oin with a different set of features.117 An example of 
such an Altc oin is Litecoin .118  
• Altcoins that are not based on  Bitcoin’s open -source protocol , but that have their own protocol 
and distributed ledger . Well -known e xamples of such  Altcoins are Ethereum and Ripple.119 
This study will focus on the ten Altcoins that currently have the highest  market capitalisation  (see  
Table 1).120 We have made this  selection , not only on the basis of the  current  popularity of these 
Altcoins  within the “ crypto -community ”, but also because they  exhibit a wide range of different 
featur es. Some of them are based on Bitcoin’s original open -source protocol, whilst others constitute 
an entirely new platform and/ or eco-system. Some utilise a PoW mechanism, others employ anoth er 
form of consensus mechanism. Most are characterised as pseudo -anonymous, yet some are said to 
even be fully anonymous (meaning that the amount of c oins their users own, send and receive is not 
observable, traceable or linkable through the blockchain’s transaction history121).

114  According to data available on  https://coinmarketcap.com/coins/views/all/  (data derived on 27 May 2018) the number of Coins in 
circulation nears 900. If we count both Coins and Tokens, the crypto -market already exceeds a total of 1600 different crypto -assets.

PE 619.024  31 3.2. Bitcoin and  beyond : the 10 c ryptocurrencies with the highest 
market capitalisation  
3.2.1.  Bitcoin (BTC)  
a. What is Bitcoin?  
Bitcoin  (BTC) is usually  described as a virtual, decentralized and (at first glance) anonymous currency 
that is not government -backed or backed by any other legal entity,  and that can not be exchanged 
into gold or any other commodity .126  
At the heart of the creation of Bitcoin stands the text " Bitcoin: a Peer -to-Peer Electronic Cash System " of 
Satoshi Nakamoto127, published on the internet in 2008. It was on the basis of this  text and the ideas 
conveyed in it that the development of Bitcoin accelerated. Contributory to the mystic nature of 
Bitcoin is that until now it remains unclear whether Satoshi Nakamoto is a real person, a pseudonym, 
or perhaps even a group of hackers .128   
The virtual character of Bitcoin  implies that Bitcoins normally do not take a physical form. Therefore, a 
good representation of a Bitcoin probably is that of a computer file saved on a personal computer or, 
via an online service, in a digital wallet .129 The mere virtual character of Bitcoins should, however, be 
qualified. Reputedly, it is possible to print out the combination of characters that constitute the

institutions, but by non- regulate d entities (i.e. so -called wallet providers). For that reason alone depositors of Bitcoins are not protected 
by deposit guarantee schemes or investor compensation schemes, as these schemes only apply to deposits at credit institutions and/or 
investment entities ( cf. Directive 94/19/EC of 30 May 1994 on deposit guarantee schemes, OJ L  31 May 1994, iss. 135, p. 5 and Article 380

to be a marginal phenomenon and, hence, will not further elaborated here.  
Bitcoin is based on a PoW consensus mechanism. The issue of Bitcoins takes place via a process called 
"mining " (see also above) . To reiterate, such process the entire elements  of which  are publicly 
available via open -source software –  entails that persons voluntarily make their own computers 
available to the Bitcoin network to solve complex mathematical problems .131 Computers that are able 
to solve such problems (and, as a conseq uence, are able to create so -called transaction "blocks ") are 
rewarded with Bitcoins .132  
The aggregate number of Bitcoins that can be created through mining is limited: the Bitcoin system is 
programmed so that the development of blocks in time will be rewarded with increasingly less 
Bitcoins and that at no point in time will more than 21 million Bitcoins exist .133 The fact that the 
creation and the increase of Bitcoins is automated and limited by the system itself implies that there 
is no need for the interven tion of a central entity / authority to issue Bitcoins.134 
The limited number of Bitcoins, together with the fact that conversion rates for Bitcoins are 
determined by supply and demand, without a government body being able to intervene (e.g. by 
printing addi tional money), results in a high volatility in Bitcoins prices .135 
b. Bitcoin runs on an open, permissionless blockchain  
The Bitcoin blockchain is a typical example of an open, permissionless blockchain .136 Any person can 
join or leave the  public  Bitcoin network at will, without having to be (pre- )approved by any (central) 
entity. All that is needed to join the Bitcoin network and add transactions to the ledger is a computer 
on which the relevant software has been installed.

PE 619.024  33 c. Bitcoin is directly convertible into fiat currency  
Bitcoin can be bought with and directly converted into fiat currency on a wide array of 
cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g . Coinbase, Kraken, Anycoin Direct137, Lunco138, …). Out of all 
cryptocurrencies  currently  in circulation, Bitcoin  is one of the easiest coins to convert into fiat 
currency.   
d. Bitcoin is a medium of exchange  
Bitcoin  (BTC)  is being accepted as a legitimate source of funds by  a relatively large number of (online) 
merchants, among which various  large companies (e.g. Microsoft139, Expedia140, Playboy141, Virgin 
Galactic142, LOT Polish Airlines143, ….)144. As a result it can be qualified as a medium of exchange.   
e. Bitcoin is a pseudo -anonymous c oin 
Bitcoin is  often  characterized as an  anonymous  currency : although everyone can verify the chain of 
transactions on the basis of the public ledger, at first glance nothing in the system connects Bitcoins 
to individuals .145 However, this anonymous character is far from absolute. It is technically feasible  – 
though very complex and costly –  to identify the p arties behind a Bitcoin transaction by bringing 
together factors that accompany such transaction .146 In other words, Bitcoin is not a fully anonymous 
currency, but rather a pseudo -anonymous coin.147  
3.2.2.  Ethereum (ETH)  
a. What is Ethereum?  
Ethereum , launched  in July 2015148, is a decentraliz ed platform that runs  so-called  “smart contracts” . 
Smart contracts are  “self-executing ” contracts or  applications that  run exactly as programmed 
without any possibility of downtime (i.e. the blockchain is never down, it is  always running), 
censorship, fraud or third -party interference.149

 34 PE 619.024  Ethereum  has a capability that goes far beyond that of  a pure P2P digital cash  equivalent  like Bitcoin . 
In simple terms,  it is much like a smartphone  operating system  on top of which softwa re applications 
can be built .150  
Technically speaking, t he Ethereu m platform itself  is not a c ryptocurrency. However, like other open, 
permissioneless  blockchains, Ethereum requires a form of on -chain value to incentivise transaction 
validation within the network  (i.e. a form of payment for the network nodes that execute the 
operations).151 This is where Ethereum’s native c ryptocurrency  “ether”  (ETH) comes into play.  Ether 
does not only allow smart contracts to be built on t he Ethereum platform (i.e. it fuels them152), but it 
also functions as a medium of exchange (specifically in the context of ITOs , as many tokens are 
bought with  ether).    
Like Bitcoin, Ethereum currently utilises a PoW consensus mechanism , but it is slowly moving towards 
the adoption of a PoS consensus  mechanism153, better known as the Casper Protocol.154 
Ethereum’s development is promoted and supported by the  “Ethereum Foundation”155, a Swiss non -
profit organiz ation,  founded by Ethereum’s i nventors. A large bulk of ether  was “pre-mined ” (i.e. 
mined / created before the c oin was  officially  launched to the public156) by its i nventors  and sold in a 
crowd sale to pay for development costs and fund the Ethereum Foundation.157   
b. Ethereum runs on an open, permissionless blockchain  
Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a prominent example of an open, permissionless blockchain. Anyone 
can join  or leave the Ethereum network at will, without having to be pre- approved  by any entity.  
c. Ether (ETH) is directly convertible into fiat currency  
Ether (ETH) can be bought with and converted  into fiat currency on various cryptocurrency 
exchanges (e.g. Coinbase, Kraken, …).  
d. Ether (ETH) is a medium of exchange 
Like Bitcoin, e ther (ETH)  is being accepted as a means of payment by a growing number of merchants 
(e.g. TapJets158, Overstock159, …). It is therefore also a medium of exchange.    
e. Ether (ETH)  is a pseudo -anonymous c oin  
Just like Bitcoin, e ther (ETH) can be categorised as a pseudo -anonymous  or pseudonymous coin.160

PE 619.024  35 3.2.3.  Ripple (XRP)  
a. What is Ripple?  
Ripple is  an open -source , P2P decentalized digital payment platform that allows for near -
instantaneous  transfers of currency regardless of their form  (e.g. US Dollar, Yen, Bitcoin , …).161 It was 
launched in 2012  by the private  company Ripple (Labs ), Inc.162 Ripple (Labs) , Inc., responsible for the 
further development of the Ripple protocol, is  the first ever  company to have received a  “BitLicense ” 
for an institutional use case of digital assets from New York’s Department of Financial Serv ices.163 It is 
also getting support from a number of big players in the financial services industry, such as Bank of 
America Merill Lynch, Santander, etc.164 
Following Ripple’s establishment , Ripple ’s inventors launched the cryptocurrency XRP. XRP was  built 
to become a bridge currency  to allow  financial institutions to settle cross- border payments  a lot  faster 
and cheaper than they can using the global payment networks  that are in place today, which can be 
slow and involve multiple middlemen  (i.e. bank s).165 However, in practic e, Ripple’s payment platform 
does not need a bridge currency to  actually  work.166  
According to Ripple, XRP  can handle more than 1,500 transactions per second.167 While it was  initially 
developed  and intended for enterprise use168, it has meanwhile been adopted by a large number of 
cryptocurrency users. Ripple  (XRP)  is not based on a  PoW  or a PoS mechanism to validate 
transactions, but it makes use of  its own specific consensus protocol .169   
The total supply of  XRP has been  fully  “pre-mined ” (or better: created upon the coin’s inception) by its 
inventors . At present, i t is held as follows170: 
• 8,102,265,714 XRP is held by Ripple (Labs) , Inc.; 
• 39,189,968,239 XRP has been distributed171; and  
• 52,700,000,024 XRP has been placed in escrow  to create certainty of XRP supply at any given 
time172.

171  It is said that Ripple’s founders still hold 20 billions XRP. See for example: M.  ORCUTT , “No, Ripple Isn’t the Next Bitcoin”, January 2018, 
https://www.technologyre view.com/s/609958/no -ripple -isnt-the-next- bitcoin/ .  
172  It should be noted that the XRP in this escrow account is indirectely owned by Ripple (Labs), Inc. See: https://ripple.com/insights/ripple -
escrows -55-billion -xrp-for-supply -predictability/ . On its website, Ripple states: “ We use Escrow to establish 55 contracts of 1 billion XRP 
each that will expire on the first day of every month from months 0 to 54. A s each contract expires, the XRP will become available for Ripple’s 
use. You can expect us to continue to use XRP for incentives to market makers who offer tighter spreads for payments and sell ing XRP to 
institutional investors. We’ll then return whatever is unused at the end of each month to the back of the escrow rotation. For example, if 500M 
XRP remain unspent at the end of the first month, those 500M XRP will be placed into a new escrow account set to expire in mo nth 55. For 
comparison, Ripple has sold  on average 300M XRP per month for the past 18 months .” IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies  
 
 36 PE 619.024  Unlike Ethereum’s inventors, Ripple’s inventors did not sell a portion of XRP via a crowdsale upon 
XRP’s creation to fund Ripple (Labs), Inc. The company was privately funded.173  
At present, it is not fully transparent  how XRP  (which is mainly held by Ripple (Labs), Inc.)  is or will be 
further distributed  in the future.  
b. Ripple runs on  a public permissioned blockchain  
Unlike Bitcoin  and Ethereum , Ripple  runs on a permissioned blockchain.174 This is because Ripp le 
(Labs ) Inc., the company behind Ripple (XRP),  determines who may act as a transaction validator on 
its network. The blockchain itself is considered public, as it  can be accessed and viewed by anyone.  
c. Ripple (XRP) is directly convertible into fiat currency  
Like Bitcoin, XRP can be directly converted  into fiat currency on various crytocurrency exchanges (e.g.  
Kraken, LiteBit175, Anycoin Direct, Bitsane176, …).  
d. Ripple (XRP) is a medium of exchange  
Ripple ( XRP ) is being  acce pted as a means of payment by a growing  number of (online) merchants  for 
various goods  and services (e.g. e- cigarettes177, honey178, coffee179, …)180. There is recentely even buzz 
and speculation on the internet that Amazon might  be looking to adopt Ripple in the near future.181     
e. Ripple  (XRP)  is a pse udo -anoymous c oin 
Like Bitcoin, Ripple  (XRP ) can be qualified  as a pseudo -anonymous coin.182   
3.2.4.  Bitcoin Cash (BCH)  
a. What is Bitcoin Cash?  
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is decentraliz ed P2P digital cash.183 It was created on the 1st of August 2017 and is 
based  on Bitcoin’s original SHA -256 PoW algorithm,  yet with some changes to its underlying code. 
Bitcoin Cash is what is known in the crypto -community as a “hard fork”  of the Bitcoin blockchain .184 It 
is the result of two very different visions on the future of Bitcoin  and the Bitcoin blockchain , whereby

PE 619.024  37 the Bitcoin blockchain  diverged  into two potential paths forward .185 In short,  some Bitcoin developers 
wanted to raise the block size limit  from 1MB to 8MB186, to reduce transaction fees and improve 
confirmation time s, whilst others had different plans .187 Because the community could not reach a 
consensus, the new c ryptocurrency Bitcoin Cash was created.188             
Like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash makes use of the PoW mechanism, which means that it can be min ed. What 
is particular about Bitcoin Cash however,  and is a direct result of the hard fork, is that anyone who 
held Bitcoin at the time Bitcoin Cash was created  (i.e. 1st of August 2017 –  13:16 UTC)  also became 
owner  of the same amount of  Bitcoin Cash .189 Any Bitcoin acquired after that specific time follows the 
original path and  does not include Bitcoin Cash.  
b. Bitcoin Cash runs on an open, permissionless blockchain 
In principle, a  “hard fork ” does not change the nature of a c oin’s blockchain .190 In other words, Bitcoin 
Cash also runs on  an open permissionless blockchain, just like Bitcoin.  
c. Bitcoin Cash is directly convertible into fiat currency  
Like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash can be  easily  converted into fiat currency and vice versa  through a number 
of cryptocurrency e xchanges (e.g. Coinbase, Kraken, LiteBit, …).  
d. Bitcoin Cash is a medium  of exchange  
Bitcoin Cash can be used to  pay for a growing array of goods and services  (e.g. jewelry, food, gaming, 
telecom, …) on a number of online market places  and platforms  (e.g. OpenBazaar191, the accept 
Bitcoin Cash initiative192). As a result, Bitcoin Cash can be qualified  as a medium  of exchange.   
e. Bitcoin Cash is a pseudo -anonymous c oin 
Although Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of Bitcoin, it doe s not differ that much from its original form.  It is 
thus also a pseudo -anonymous c oin.193  
3.2.5.  Litecoin (LTC)  
a. What is Litecoin?  
Like Bitcoin, Litecoin (LTC)  is an open- source  decentraliz ed P2P c ryptocurrency.194 It was launched in 
October 2011 and is based on  what is know n as the  Scrypt PoW algorithm , which utilises Bitcoin’s

December 2017, https://coincentral.com/how -long -do-bitcoin -transfers- take/ .  
187  Ibid. 
188  It is important to note that Bitcoin’s code is open source. It is managed and updated by volunteers who must  achieve consensus among 
nodes for a change to be adopted. If no consensus can be reached the risk of a hard fork exists. See: EY, “ IFRS – Accounting for crypto -

 38 PE 619.024  original SHA -256 PoW  algorithm.195 Litecoin is often described as the ‘silver’ to Bitcoin’s gold.196 Apart 
from the fact that it  uses a different algorithm, i t is different  from Bitcoin in two  ways . 
Firstly , and this results from the use of the Scrypt PoW algorithm , Litecoin offers a much faster 
transaction speed than Bitcoin. T he time needed to generate a block on the Bitcoin BC is about ten 
minutes197, while t he average block creation  time on the Litecoin blockchain is approximately 2.5 
minutes.198     
Secondly, the total supply limit of Litecoin is with 84 million  coins, much higher than the 21 million 
supply limit  of Bitcoin.199  
b. Litecoin runs on an open, permissionless blockchain  
Just like Bitcoin, Litecoin runons on an open, permissionless blockchain. All that is needed to join the 
network is a download of the open -source software  code .  
c. Litecoin is directly convertible into fiat currency  
Litecoin can be bought with fiat currency  on a number of cryptocurrency exchanges  (e.g.  
BTCDirect200, LiteBit,  Coinbase,  Anycoin Direct, …) and can , on those exchanges , just as easily be 
exchanged for fiat currency.    
d. Litecoin is a medium of exchange  
Litecoin is accepted as a means of payment by a gradually growing number of online merchants.201 
Like Bitcoin, it thus  also constitutes a medium of exchange.  
e. Litecoin is a pseudo- anonymous c oin 
Just like Bitcoin, Litec oin i s a pseudo -anonymous c oin. E veryone can verify the chain of LTC 
transaction s on the basis of the public ledger, which would make it  technically possible to identify the 
coins sender and/or receiver.202  
f. Litecoin and t he case of “Atomic Swaps ” 
It should be noted that the Litecoin community recently introduced a new technology into th e 
crypto -world that is being referred to as the  “atomic swap” . Simply put,  an atomic swap  enable s a P2P 
cross- chain exchange or trade  of one cryptocurrency for another c ryptocurrency, without the need of

197  A transaction generally needs si x confirmations or ‘blocks’ before its processed. As a result, the time needed to confirm a transaction on 
the Bitcoin blockchain normally averages around one hour. However, due to Bitcoin’s rise in popularity, congestions have aris en on the 
Bitcoin networ k. In some cases, transaction times have been reported to exceed several hours. See for example: S.  BUCHKO , “How Long 
do Bitcoin Transactions Take?”, December 2017, https://coincentral.com/how -long -do-bitcoin -transfers -take/ .   
198  It has been argued that the enabling of faster transactions might pose a security issue, since less thorough checks of the da ta are 
required. See: J. MARTINDALE , “What is Litecoin? Here’s everything you need to know”, January 2018, 
https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what- is-litecoin/ .

PE 619.024  39 a third -party.203 For example, if Anna  has one Bitcoin and she wants 100 Litecoins in return, she would 
normally have to go through an exchange (i.e . a third -party) and pay certain fees to get this trade 
done. Suppose that Jeff owns 100 Litecoins and he instead wants one Bitcoin,  then with an atomic 
swap  Anna and Jeff  could simply trade  their  Coins with one  another.204 Now, in practice an atomic 
swap is of course not so easy.  
First of all, since  it is presently still in its infancy , the implementation of the atomic swap technology  
requires a lot  of IT -know ledge . For example, a link has to be made between the two  cryptocurrency  
blockchains , which requires the implementation of an IT -protocol known  in the crypto -community  as 
the “Lightning Protocol ”.205 In addition , both blockchains  have to share the same cryptographic 
function ( for example the SHA -256 function ) in order for the atomic swap to be possible.206 While we 
are not there yet in terms of user friendly cross -chain trading, the emergence of the atomic swap 
technology brings forth  a whole new set of challenges.  
3.2.6.  Stellar (XLM)  
a. What is Stellar?  
Like Ripple, Stellar is an open -source, distributed payments infrastructure. Stellar was created  in 2014 
by one of Ripple’s founding fathers.207 Its goal  is to connect people to low -cost financia l services to 
fight poverty and develop individual potential.208 Stellar can also be used to build smart contracts.209 
It is not based on a PoW or PoS consensus mechanism, but has its own specific consensus protocol.  
Stellar  is home to the c ryptocurrency Lumen (XLM) . In short, L umens are  used  to pay for tran sactions 
on the Stellar network;  they contribute to the ability to move money around the world and to 
conduct transactions between different currencies quickly and securely .210 
Stellar’s development is supported by the non- profit organization Stellar.org  (incorporated in 2014 as 
a non -stock nonprofit corporation in the U.S. State of Delaware ), which  contributes to the 
development of tools and social good initiatives around the Stellar network and financial inclusion.211 
Its employees contribute code to the network, but the network itself is said to be completely  
independent of the organization.212  
Similar to Ripple’s c ryptocurrency XRP, t he total supply of Stellar Lumens is “pre-mined ”. It is held  by 
Stellar.org  who has been given the task to distribute  Lumens for free , in the following manner213: 
• 50% is  to be  given away to individuals  (via a direct sign -up program ); 
                                                             
203  See: R. ROSE O’L EARY , “ Atomic Action: Will 2018 Be the Year of the Cross -Blockchain Swap? ”, January 2018, 
https://www.coindesk.com/atomic -action -will-2018 -year -cross -blockchain -swap/ .  
204  A recent test case completed by the inventor of Litecoin, Mr Charlie Lee, shows that atomic swaps between Litecoin and Bitcoi n are 
indeed possible. See: J.  BUCK, “First BTC -LTC Lightning Network Swap Completed, Huge Potential ”, November 2017, 
https://cointelegraph.com/news/first- btc-ltc-lightning -network -swap -completed -huge -potential .  
205  A. ROSIC , “What is Litecoin? A Basic Beginners Guide ”, December 2017, https://blockgeeks.com/guides/litecoin/ .   
206  See: B. ASOLO , “What are Atomic Swaps?” , May 2018, https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what -are-atomic -swaps/ . This 
means that theoretically, swaps between a number of Cryptocurrencies could be possible.  
207  See inter alia : C. ADAMS , “Stellar Lumens Vs Ripple ”, March 2018, https://www.investinblockchain.com/stellar -lumens -vs-ripple/ ; S. TOWN , 
“Introduction to Stellar Lumens (XLM) –  The Future of Banking ”, April 2018, https://cryptoslate.com/stellar -lumens/ .  
208  See: https://www.stellar.org/about/ . It should be noted that Stellar’s primary target audience (i.e. the individual) is thus totally different 
from Ripple’s (i.e. financial institutions).

• 20% is given  away to Bitcoin and XRP holders; and  
• 5% is reserved for Stellar.org’s operational expenses.  
The actual distribution is not  conducted  at once, but  over time in a number of rounds.  
b. Stellar runs on  a permissionless blockchain  
Unlike  Ripple , Stellar runs on a permissionless blockchain. Anyone can join the network  at will  and, if 
certain conditions are met, validate transactions without having to be pre- approved or vetted by any 
central administrator.214  
c. Lumens (XLM) are  directly convertible into fiat currency  
Lumens (XLM) can be directly converted into fiat currency through cryptocurrency exchanges such as 
LiteBit (up to a maximum amount of EUR 500 (per transaction))  or Kraken.    
d. Lumens (XLM) are  NOT a  true  medium of exchange  yet 
At present, so it seems,  Lumens (XLM)  can only be used to pay for promotional Stellar stickers215, 
breakfast at a local breakfast bar in Arkansas216 and sprouts217. While this proves that they are 
gradually being accepted as a means of payment, they are not a true medium of exchange  yet, at 
least not if you  compare them to the c oins discussed above.   
e. Lum ens (XLM) are pseudo -anonymous c oins 
All transactions on the Stellar network are public , but they cannot be linked easily to the identities of 
their users .218 As a result,  Stellar  Lumens  (XLM)  can be qualified as  pseudo -anonymous c oins.   
3.2.7.  Cardano (ADA)  
a. What is Cardano ? 
Like Ethereum, Cardano  is designed and being further developed as a platform on top of which smart 
contrac ts and decentraliz ed applications  (so-called “Dapps”)  can be run.219 The Cardano project 
began in 2015220, and was officially released  to the public  in September 2017221. It is based on what is 
known as the Ouroboros PoS algorithm.222

PE 619.024  41 The Cardano platform  is hom e to the open source decentraliz ed c ryptocurrency Ada (ADA).223 Ada  
can be used to send and receive digital funds . It fuels the Cardano platform, just like  the currency  
“ether”  fuels  the Ethereum platform.  
In short, Cardano aims to improve  scalability, security, governance, and interoperability with 
traditional financial sys tems and regulations , by learning from and improving on lessons learned in 
the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities.224 
What distinguishes Cardano from Ethereum, and from many other c ryptocurrencies , is that it is (one 
of the  first)  blockchain  project s to be developed and designed from a scientific philosophy  by a team 
of leading academics and engineers.225 Another notable  difference is that , at present,  the 
cryptocurrency Ada (ADA)  can only be stored in Cardano’s own digital wallet Daedalus .226   
The Cardan o project  currently  has three main contributors  that each have separate roles:  
• the Cardano foundation, based in Switzerland, which aims to  standardise, protect and promote 
the Cardano technology  and eco -system;  
• IOHK, a blockchain engineering company responsible for building the Cardano blockchain ; and  
• Emurgo , an entity  responsible for  the fostering  of commercial applications being built upon the 
Cardano ecosystem.  
Similar to Ethereum (cf.  ether), a good number  of Ada was “ pre-mined ” (i.e. mined / created  before 
the c oin was launched to the public) by its i nventors and sold in a crowdsale to pay for development 
costs.227 
b. Cardano  runs  both permissionless and  permissioned blockchains  
Cardano ’s Ouroboros  PoS algorithm  allows the platform to run both permissionless and permissioned 
blockchains.228  
c. Ada (ADA) is directly convertible into fiat currency  
The currency Ada (ADA) can be directly converted into fiat currency. However, w e found that , at 
present, only one cryptocurrency e xchange offers the option to directly convert Ada ( ADA)  into Euro, 
being LiteBit and only up to a maximum amount of  EUR 500 (per transaction) .  
Ada can, on the contrary,  easily be exchanged for other c ryptocurrencies (for example through an 
exchange such as Bittrex229 or Binance). These c ryptocurrencies can then be converted into fiat 
currency.  
d. Ada (ADA) is NOT a true  medium of exchange yet 
Our research shows that, at present , Ada can only be used to pay for a very limited number of services 
(e.g. Hotel Ginebra Barcelona accepts payment in Ada230). While this proves that Ada is gradually

 42 PE 619.024  being accepted as a means of payment, it is not a true medium of exchange yet, at leas t not if you 
compare it to the c oins discussed above. This could however c hange fairly quickly.231    
e. Ada (ADA) is a pseudo -anonymous c oin 
Just like the c ryptocurrencies analysed above, Ada can be q ualified as a pseudo -anonymous c oin.232 It 
is interesting to note  however – and as far as we could establish, unparalleled – that know y our 
customer (KYC) standards were applied  during the initial offering  of Ada.233 
3.2.8.  IOTA (MIOTA)  
a. What is IOTA?  
IOTA , launched  in 2016234, is an open -source eco -system where people  and machines can transfer 
value (i.e. money) and/or data without any transaction fees in a trustless,  permissionless, and 
decentraliz ed environment .235  
In short, IOTA employs specific technology that  is said to be more scalable  than  the technology  
behind most  other coins , and  promises faster  transaction speeds .236 Like the cryptocurrencies  
analysed  above, IOTA is based on distributed ledger technology. However, unlike  those other 
cryptocurrencies, IOTA’s distributed ledger does not consist of transactions grouped into 
(transaction) “ blocks ” and stored into sequential chains (i.e. it is not a “blockchain ”), but of a stream of 
individual transactions entangled together.237 IOTA is based on  what is known as a directed acyclic 
graph (DAG).238 Because transaction s are entangled together, this technology is also  being referred to  
as the “ Tangle ”.239  
Instead of requiring miners to perform computational PoW  and validate transaction blocks in 
exchange for newly  “mined ” coins, IOTA’s network participants create a consensus  themse lves  by 
validating two previous transactions each time they wish to make a  new  transaction .240 
At present, IOTA is still very much in its infancy. This is reflected, inter alia , by the fact that in order to 
fully secure the network all transactions have t o be digitally signed by a special  network  node  (i.e. the 
“Coordinator”241). Because this affects the network ’s true decentraliz ed nature, IOTA’ s development 
team  is working hard on an update to remove this special node by the end of 2018.242  
The IOTA  eco-system is being further develo ped , supported, promoted  and maintained  by the  “IOTA  
Foundation ”243, a German  non -profit foundation , founded by IOTA’s inventors. The total supply of

sold by IOTA’ s inventors in a crowdsale to pay for  development costs and fund the IOTA  
Foundation .245 
b. IOTA runs on a permissionless distributed ledger  
IOTA is not based on  blockchain  technology, but constitutes a different application of distributed 
ledger technology. It is – to pu t it in the words of its develo pers – envisaged to be (come) the public  
and permissionless  backbone protocol for the internet of things  that enables true int eroperability 
between all devices .246   
c. IOTA  is directly convertible into fiat currency  
The c ryptocurrency IOTA  (MIOTA)  can be directly converted into fiat currency  (such as Euro) . 
However, our research shows that, at present, only one cryptocurrency e xchange offers the option to 
directly convert IOTA ( MIOTA ) into Euro, being CoinFalcon247.  
IOTA can, on the contrary,  easily be exchanged for other c ryptocurrencies (for example through an 
exchange such as Binance). These c ryptocurrencies can then be converted into fiat currency.  
d. IOTA  is NOT a medium of exchange  
It seems that there are currently no (online ) merchants that accept  IOTA as a means of payment for 
certain goods or services. IOTA is thus not a medium of exchange. It cannot be ruled out however, 
that it may become one in the (near) future .248  
e. IOTA is a pseudo -anonymous c oin 
Despite IOTA’s unique  eco-system , like most c ryptocurrencies it has  a transparent and publicly

3.2.9.  NEO (NEO)  
a. What is NEO?  
Similar to  Ethereum and Cardano, NEO is a n open -source  blockchain  platform on top of which  smart 
contracts and decentraliz ed applications  (so-called “Dapps”) can be run.  NEO, sometimes referred to 
as the “Chinese Ethereum”250, was originally  launched  under the name “ Antshares ” in February 
2014.251 The project  was rebranded “NEO ” in June 2017.252

 44 PE 619.024  In short, the  NEO project is aimed at digitising assets and  automating the management of digital 
assets, in order to  create a so -called  “smart economy”  (i.e. an economy where parties can agree on a 
contract without the need to trust each other) .253  
Just like Ethereum (cf.  “ether” ), NEO  itself is  technically  not a c ryptocurrency. NEO’s native currency is 
called “GAS”. In simple terms, GAS is a fee to  be paid to be allowed to utilise NEO’s network. One 
could in fact say that it  “fuels ” the platform . What is particular about the NEO platform  (and 
distinguishes it from  the Ethereum and Cardano plaforms)  is that holding the digital value “ NEO ” 
(which could best be described as some sort of hybrid crypto -asset)  automatically generates  an 
amount of  GAS  over time .254     
NEO is based on  a consensus mechanism known  in the crypto -community  as the delegated Byzantine 
Fault Tolerance ( dBFT) algorithm , which  could potentially  support 10.000 transactions per second.255  
The total supply of NEO was “pre-mined ”256; half of it was sold in a crowdsale and the other half is  
managed by the NEO Council (i.e. group of the project’s founders)  to support development and 
maintenance of the NEO ecosystem.257 
b. NEO runs on a permissioned blockchain  
In order to become a transaction validator  (i.e. a node) on the NEO  network , a validator candidate has 
to be (i) selected  by NEO’s development team and  (ii) voted in by the NEO community (i.e. those who 
hold NEO).258 These characteristics are typical for a permissioned blockchain.  
c. NEO is d irectly convertible into fiat currency , GAS is not 
NEO  can be directly converted into fiat currency . However,  our research shows that, at present,  only 
one cryptocurrency ex change offers the option to directly convert NEO into  Euro, being Anycoin 
Direct259.  
NEO’s native currency GAS can presently not be directly converted into fiat currency. 
Both NEO  and GAS  can, however, easily be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies  (for example 
through an exchange such as  Bittrex ). These cryptocurrencies  can then be conve rted into fiat 
currency.      
d. NEO ’s GAS  is NOT  a medium of exchange   
While NEO is working very closely  with  big tech companies  like Microsoft260, its native currency  GAS is  
not a medium of exchange (nor is NEO itself). Contrary to a number of  other c oins discussed above,

neo -smart -economy -381a4c6ee286 .  
254  GAS itself can also be individually acquired, for example on the Cryptocurrency Exchange Binance ( https://www.binance.com/ ).

working/decentralization -from -coopetition- b10d7ce3b9d .  
259  It should be noted that “on paper” the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex ( https://www.bitfinex.com ) also offers the option to convert 
NEO into Euro. However, in practise it proves to be very difficult (to impossible) to actually withdraw such funds from the p laform.    
260  See for example:  H. NASEER , “NEO Launches Dev Competition with $490,000 Prize Pool, Co -organized by Microsoft”, November 2017, 
https://cryptovest.com /news/neo -launches -dev-competition -with -490000 -prize -pool -co-organized -by-microsoft/ ; W. SUBERG , “NEO Cryptocurrencies and blockchain  
 
PE 619.024  45 our research did not reveal any online merchants willing to accept NEO’s c oins  as a means of 
payment. Some argue that GAS is in fact  not really  intended to be a true medium of exchange.261 
However, the same was also said for Ethereum’s currency ether (ETH). With that in mind, it  cannot be 
entirely  ruled out that GAS  (or even NEO itself)  may still become a medium of exchange  in the future.   
e. NEO ’s GAS  is a pseudo -anonymous c oin 
In essence, NEO’s GAS  could be qualified as a pseudo -anonymous  or pseudonymous  coin, just like the 
coins  analysed  above . However,  NEO’ s core developers  are currently actively working on a concept 
that would allow coders  of smart contracts to tie a so -called “ digital identity ” to a real world 
identity .262 It is not enti rely inconceivable – yet at this time still highly unclear – that this technology 
will also impact GAS’s pseudo -anonymous character.263  
3.2.10.  Monero (XMR)  
a. What is Monero?  
Monero  (XMR) is an open -source  P2P cryptocurrency  “with a focus on private and censorship -resistant 
transactions ”.264 It was launched  in April 2014265 and is based on  what is known as the CryptoNote266 
PoW algorithm .  
Monero has been  specifically  developed to allow its users to execute transactions in full anony mity. It 
is said to be cryptographically private by default.267 In particular , it uses cryptography to shield both 
sending and receiving addresses  (i.e. so-called ‘keys’268), as well as transacted amounts.    
Monero (XMR) is characterized as being  fully fungible. This means that two units of XMR  can always  
be mutually substituted and there can be no blacklisting of certain units of XMR  by vendors or 
exchanges due to their association in previous transactions .269 Non -fungible cryptocurrencies, like 
Bitcoin and Litecoin, are theoretically susceptible to blacklisting; if they have  been used for an illegal 
purpose in the past,  then such  history will be contained in the blockchain forever.   
Unlike some other Coins, M onero (XMR) has not been pre- mined.  
b. Monero runs on a permissionless blockchain  
Just like Bitcoin, Monero (XMR) runs on  a permissionless blockchain.270 Anyone can join the network 
at will, without having to be pre- approved or vetted by any central administrat or.

 46 PE 619.024  c. Monero is directly convertible into fiat currency  
Monero (XMR) can be directly converted into fiat currency on  a number of  cryptocurrency exchanges 
(e.g. LiteBit, Anycoin Direct, Kraken, …).  
d. Monero is a medium of exchange 
Monero is accepted as a means  of payment by a gradually growing number of online merchants.271 
Like Bitcoin, it thus also constitutes a medium of exchange.  
e. Monero is a n anonymous c oin  
On a fully transparent blockchain , such as the Bitcoin  or Ethereum  blockchain , transactions are always 
openly verifiable and traceable by anyone. In practic e – though this will be no easy task  – the sending 
and receiving addresses  for such transactions could also be linked to a person's real -life identity.272 
This is where Monero advocates to be different. It positions itself as a secure, private and untraceable 
cryptocurrency.  
This high standard  of anonymity  is achieved using two different techniques:  
• Ring Confidential Transactions (“ RingCT ”); and  
• Stealth ad dresses.  
i. Ring Confidential Transactions  
Firstly, Monero makes use of so -called Ring Confidential Transactions. RingCT combine the technique 
of ring signatures and what is referred to in the crypto -community as the confidential transactions 
concept:  
- Ring signatures combine or 'mix' a user's account keys with public keys obtained from 
Monero's blockchain  to create, what could be called a 'ring' of possible signers273, meaning 
outside observers cannot link a signature to a specific user.274 Combined with stealth  
addresses (see below) they  allow to fully obscure the identify of both senders and recipients 
of XMR;  
- Confidential transactions  add another layer of privacy to the ‘mix’ by also concealing the 
amount of each transaction.275 Without revealing the actual numb ers, they include a 
cryptographic proof that the sum of the input amounts is the same as the sum of the output 
amounts.276   
ii. Stealth Addresses  
Secondly, and in addition to RingCT, Monero also makes use of stealth addresses. Stealth addresses 
are randomly generated, one- time addresses created for each transaction made by the sender on 
behalf of the recipient. All payments  sent to the recipient are routed through these addresses , 
ensuring there are no links on the blockchain  between the sender’s  and the reci pient’s  address .277 In

PE 619.024  47 other words,  stealth addresses prevent linkability on the blockchain . However,  without the use of 
RingCT, the original sender of the c oins would still  be able to trac e the c oins if they would be  moved 
by the recipient  by identifying ou tputs on the blockchain . RingCT masks these outputs, making the 
transaction entirely untraceable.278    
iii. The Kovri -Project  
It should be noted that the community of (core) developers and cryptography experts behind 
Monero is currently working on a project to add yet another layer of privacy to the Monero eco -
system by  routing and encrypt ing XMR  transactions via I2P Invisible Internet Project nodes.279 The use 
of I2P  will obfuscate a transactor 's IP address and provide further protection against network 
monitoring .  
This project, of which an alpha version is currently in the works, is better known in the crypto -
community as the Kovri -project.

3.2.11.  Dash (DASH)  
a. What is Dash?  
Dash  (DASH) , formerly know n as Darkcoin280, is an open source P2P privacy- centric  cryptocurrency.281 
It was first launched in January 2014 and is based on what is known as the X11 PoW  algorithm.282 
What is specific to Dash , and makes it different from  most other c oins, is that it has a two -tier network . 
Dash’s blockchain  is secured  via so-called  “masterno des” in addition to the PoW done by miners.283    
In short, a  masternode is  a server connected to the Dash network which guarantees a certain 
minimum level of performance and functionality to perform certain tasks related  to PrivateSend and 
InstantSend  (Dash ’s anonymity and instant transaction features).284  
Transactions with traditional c ryptocurrencies can be very time- consuming  (i.e. they can take 
anywhere between  a few minutes and  more than one hour). This is due to the fact that enough blocks 
have to pass to ensure that a transaction is irreversible and at the same time not an attempt to 
double -spend money that has already been spent.285 Dash tackles this issue utilising its masternode 
network. Masternodes can be called upon to form voting quorums to check wh ether or not a 
submitted transaction is valid  and if it is, “the masternodes ‘lock’ the inputs for the transaction and 
broadcast this information to the network, effectively promising that the transaction will be included in 
subsequently mined blocks and not allowing any other spending of these inputs during the confirmation 
time period ”.286 As a result Dash is said to be able to compete with nearly instantaneous transaction 
systems, such as credit cards.287 
b. Dash runs on an open, permissionless blockchain  
Like Monero, Dash runs on  a permissionless blockchain.288 Anyone can join the network at will, 
without having to be pre -approved or vetted by any central administrator.  
c. Dash is directly convertible into fiat currency  
Dash (DASH) can be directly converted into f iat currency  through various cryptocurrency e xchanges 
(e.g. Anycoin Direct, Kraken, …).

Just like Monero, Dash is being accepted as a means of payment by a steadily growing number of 
online merchants.289 As a result Dash also constitutes a medium of exchange.  
e. Dash is a n (optional ) anonymous c oin 
Like Bitcoin ’s blockchain , Dash ’s blockchain  is transparent by default, which means  that generally 
speaking  transactions are always openly verifiable and traceable  on the blockchain . To give its users 
true financial privacy, Dash offers the option to use a feature called PrivateSend . PrivateSend obscures 
the origins of a user’s funds through a process known as  “mixing ”.290

3.3. Conclusion : a taxonomy and timeline of cryptocurrencies  
On the basis of the above overview and the above analysis we come to a taxonomy and timeline of 
cryptocurrencies, allowing to more precisely conduct the regulatory analysis and  to signal  the flaws of 
the reg ulatory framework hereinafter.  
We start with the taxonomy.  
What is clear from the overview is that THE cryptocurrency is non existing. Although some are similar 
to each other, there is a lot of variation as to how they are structured, on which technology they ru n, 
the anonymity involved, etc.  
The below table intends to illustrate this d iversity. The selected cryptocurrencies are compared on the 
basis of various parameters: whether they run on permissioned or permissionless technology, their 
decentralized nature, whether they were initially offered by an identifiable person or entity, if they are 
electronically traded, directly convertible into fiat currency, are a medium of exchange and are 
pseudo -anonymous  or fully anonymous. These parameters are not chosen randomly, but help to 
                                                             
289  See for an overview of online merchants that accept payments in Dash: https://www.dash.org/merchants/ .  
290  See: http s://docs.dash.org/en/latest/introduction/features.html#privatesend .  “1. PrivateSend begins by breaking your transaction inputs down into standard denominations. These denominations are 0.01 Dash , 
0.1 DASH, 1 DASH and 10 DASH – much like the paper money you use every day.  
2. Your wallet then sends requests to specially conf igured software nodes on the network, called ‘masternodes’. These masternodes 
are informed then that you are interested in mixing a certain denomination. No identifiable information is sent to the master nodes, 
so they never know ‘who’ you are.  
3. When two other people send similar messages, indicating that they wish to mix the same denomination, a mixing session begins. 
The masternode mixes up the inputs and instructs all three users’ wallets to pay the now -transformed input back to themselves. Your 
wallet pays that denomination directly to itself, but in a different address (called a change address).  
4. In order to fully obscure your funds, your wallet must repeat this process a number of times with each denomination. Each time the 
process is completed, it’ s called a ‘round’. Each round of PrivateSend makes it exponentially more difficult to determine where your 
funds originated. The user may choose between 2 -8 rounds of mixing.  
5. This mixing process happens in the background without any intervention on you r part. When you wish to make a transaction, your 
funds will already be anonymized. No additional waiting is required.”  IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies  
 
 50 PE 619.024  assess hereinafter to what extent the cryptocurrencies are caught by AMLD5, which crypto players are 
included in the scope of AMLD5, whether regulation can be attached to relevant players that are not 
(yet) i n scope, etc.  
The table reflects our understanding of the selected cryptocurrencies. It should be read mind ful of the 
fact that making clear -cut distinctions between cryptocurrencies is not easy.291 Complicating factors 
are inter alia  the scarcity of the information available and the often highly technical nature thereof. 
Moreover, cryptocurrencies are a moving t arget. E.g. a cryptocurrency that is not a medium of 
exchange now , can be one  tomorrow . Therefore, the overview does not pretend to be the only way of 
portraying or classifying the  selected cryptocurrencies.   
Arguably, to get an absolutely clear picture of  cryptocurrencies and all their different features in view 
of giving the best possible policy advice, more work needs to be done and further research is 
required. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this study, we are of the opinion that below table is a 
wor kable instrument, allowing to draw some conclusions throughout the regulatory analysis.  
  
                                                             
291  Sometimes it is even not easy to make a clear -cut distinction between the technology a coin runs on and the coin itself . Cryptocurrencies and blockchain

 52 PE 619.024  Moving on to a timeline of cryptocurrencies, further contributing to a better understanding of these 
coins for regulatory purposes. We observed the following. Where the first cryptocurrencies were 
developed as pure P2P digital cash equivalents, the analysi s above shows that novel forms of 
cryptocurrencies have meanwhile been created to serve different and /or additional purposes. In 
2014 we saw the emergence of cryptocurrencies advocated to be fully anonymous. In 2015 a crucial 
tipping point appears to  have  been the creation  of the Ethereum platform, which initiated  the 
development of completely  new eco system s or platform s on top of which so-called smart contracts 
and /or decentralized applications  (“Dapps”)  can be run , fueled by a new generation of 
cryptocurrencies . This ever -growing technological complexity and evolving nature of 
cryptocurrencies292, as illustrated in the timeline included as  Figure 2 below, should be taken heed of

 EU REGULATORY  FRAMEWORK   
4.1. Setting the scene: similar regulatory challenges in the fight against 
money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion via 
cryptocurrencies  
4.1.1.  Anonymity  
The key issue that needs to be addressed in order to adequately capture cryptocurrencies and 
cryptocurrency players, particularly us ers, in legislation is to unveil  the anonymity, varying from 
complete anonymity to pseudo -anonymity, that surrounds them .294 This is the biggest problem for 
combating money laundering and countering terrorist financing: the anonymity prevents 
cryptocurrency transactions from being adequately monitored, allowing shady transactions to occur 
outside of the regulatory perimeter, allowing criminal organisations to use cryptocurrencies to obtain 
easy access to "clean cash" (both cash in/out). Relating to terrorist financing, the story of Ali Shukri 
Amin who provided instructions over Twitter on how to use Bitcoin to mask the provision of funds to 
Daesh is a striking example of the risks brought by the anonymity surrounding cryptocurrencies .295  
Anonymity is also the major issue when it comes to tax evasion. Entering into taxable cryptocurrency 
transactions without paying taxes is tax evasion. But, when a tax authority d oes not know who enters 
into the taxable transaction, because of the anonymity involved, it cannot detect nor sanction this tax 
evasion. This makes cryptocurrencies a very attractive means for tax evaders .296 By some 
commentators instruments such as Bitcoin were even described as "tomorrow's tax havens" .297 
This being said, and as apparent from our overview of cryptocurrencies above, it should be noted that 
some cryptocurrencies are pseudo -anonymous, which basically means that if great effort is made298 
and complex techniques are deployed, it is possible for authorities to find out users' identities. 
Although this can already be a help in the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and tax 
evasion in some cases, it does not allow a standardiz ed approach to tackle money laundering, 
terrorist financing and tax evasion more widely: discovering identities in this way is too complex and 
costly to become the general answer to tackling this issue -  and moreover, it will not certainly l ead to 
any resu lt. New initiatives like the Investigation of Transactions in Underground Markets 
(“TITANIUM ”) project299, may change this  at some point, but it is still to early to tell to what extent. In 
any event , a more structural regulatory approach  is desirable .

298  The emergence of quantum computing, which uses the laws of quantum mechanics to process large volumes of information much 
more efficiently than traditional computing, may be able to change this. However, this  is not something investigators will be able to 
apply tomorrow. At present, quantum computing still remains at an embryonic stage of theoretical development. See for an

 54 PE 619.024  Box 3: Some thoughts on the TITANIUM project  
 
4.1.2.  Cross -border nature  
In addition to anonymity, the intrinsically cross -border nature of cryptocurrencies, crypto markets and 
crypto players is  a major challenge for regulators .300 One of the issues is e.g. that crypto markets and 
crypto players can be located in jurisdictions that do not have effective money laundering and 
terrorist financing controls in place.301 The cross -border nature of cryptocu rrencies, crypto markets 
and crypto players probably means that rules will only be adequate when they are taken at a 
sufficiently international level.  
4.1.3.  Often no central intermediary  
Another factor of importance challenging the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and 
tax evasion is that there is often no central intermediary, such as an issuer, that would normally be the 
focal point of regulation .302 Therefore, an important question is to which players in the crypto market 
should regul ation be attached, absent a central intermediary.  
4.1.4.  Cryptocurrencies are falling between the cracks  
The existing European legal framework is failing to deal with the aforementioned issues. There are 
simply no rules unveiling  the anonymity associated with cry pto-currencies, making the question 
whether they are taken at the right level or to whom they apply a superfluous one.  
Because o f the absence of rules unveiling  anonymity, more substantive rules that currently could 
already have cryptocurrencies in scope completely miss effect. This is particularly true for the legal

https://www.imf.org/external /pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1603.pdf , 25. The TITANIUM project will research, develop, and validate novel data -driven techniques and solutions designed to support law 
enforcement agencies charged with investigating criminal or terrorist activities involving virtual currencies and/or 
underground markets in the darknet. The expected result of the project is a set of services and forensic tools, which operate 
within a privacy and data protection environment that is configurable to local legal requirements, and can be used by 
investigators for inter alia  analyzing transactions across different virtual currency ledgers.  
It is clear that the TITANIUM project is directly relevant for the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and ta x 
evasion via cryptocurrencies. If successful, it will add to t he toolbox of law enforcement agencies tracking down money 
laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion via cryptocurrencies. Interesting will be to see whether the new techniques 
developed are less complex and costly than the once already available to trace criminals using pseudo -anonymous 
cryptocurrencies. Probably we can only speak of significant progress if the outcome would be that law enforcement agencies 
would have at their disposal an easy to use and relatively cheap method to trace criminals usi ng cryptocurrencies. It will also 
be interesting to find out whether the new techniques can be deployed both to pseudo anonymous and fully anonymous 
coins.   
In any event, and without prejudice to the TITANIUM project being extremely relevant and valuable,  it is not something we 
can suffice with . As we will evidence  throughout this research , there is also a need for a more structural, regulatory approach . 
It goes without saying that such approach and enhancing the toolbox of law enforcement agencies on the basis of the 
TITANIUM project  go hand in hand: to ensure compliance with the regulatory framework, law enforcement agencies must be 
able to adequately detect infractions (via the new ly developed  techniques) and subsequently sanction them.   Cryptocurrencies and blockchain  
 
PE 619.024  55 framework on exchange of information in the field of taxation.303 The framework simply cannot be 
activated: to exchange information, authorities must have it in the first place. For the same rea sons, 
the current EU framework on tax avoidance304, relating inter alia  to exit taxes in the context of assets 
transfers by corporates, miss effect when it comes to cryptocurrencies, because of their anonymous 
and easy- to-hide nature. To be able to tax, the tax administration should know of the taxable basis 
and when it comes to cryptocurrencies this is just extremely difficult.  
Another example relates to the freezing and confiscation of property. Substantively, it is arguable that 
cryptocurrencies are alrea dy in scope of the relevant European rules .305 Property within these rules 
refers to property of any description, whether corporeal or incorporeal, movable or immovable, and 
legal documents or instruments evidencing title or interest in such property. Well, it is acceptable that 
cryptocurrencies are within the remit of this definition: they could be seen as incorporeal moveable 
property. Yet, leaving a few examples of success stories aside, the rules largely miss effect. The reason, 
again, is the same: to be able to freeze and confiscate cryptocurrencies it is necessary to know that a 
criminal has them, and this is what the anonymity surrounding cryptocurrencies prevents.  
So, the crux of  the matter is how we can unveil  the anonymity related to cryptocurrency transactions 
so as to be able to track the illegal transactions.  
4.1.5.  A difficult dividing line with cybersecurity, data protection and privacy 
It is accepted that encryption, which is basically what happens in the context of cryptocurrencies, is 
an effective way for citizens and businesses to defend themselves against the abuse of IT 
technologies, such as hacking, identity and personal data theft, fraud and the improper disclosure of 
confidential information. However, encryption can also be used by criminals, e.g. the use of 
cryptocurrencies for money laundering or terrorist financing, complicating law enforcement 
authorities’ criminal investigations. Therefore, it is a thin line between preserving strong encryption 
for the protection of cybersecurity, data pro tection and privacy on the one hand, while offering 
opportunities for legitimate law enforcement access to information for the purpose of criminal 
investigations with appropriate safeguards on the other hand, as was recognized by the European 
Commission .306 We raise this issue, but will not elaborate on cybersecurity, data protection and 
privacy aspects in this research. That would exceed the scope.307  
                                                             
303  Council Directive 2011/16/EU of 15 February 2011 on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation and repealing Directi ve 
77/799/EEC, as amended from to time, as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation; this Di rective 
was very recently, on 25 May 2018, amended again with rules relating to the mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field 
of taxation for reportable cross -border arrangements and reporting duties of intermediaries (see a first analysis: 
https://www.tiberghien.com/en/1282/new -reporting -obligation -for-cross -border -arrangements -council -directive -approv ed-25-may -
2018 ).  
304  Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 of 12 July 2016 laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the f unctioning 
of the internal market, OJ L  193, 19 July 2016 (electronically available via https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -
content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1164&from=EN ).  
305  The current EU legal framework on the freezing and confiscation of proceeds of crime consists of four Council Framework Decisions 
(FD) and one Council Decision: Framework Decision 2001/500/JHA13, Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA15, Framework Decision 
2003/577/JHA17, Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA18 and Council Decision 2007/845/JHA19. Also se e the proposal for a directive on 
the freezing and confiscation of proceeds of crime in the European Union of 12 March 2012, COM(2012) 85 final and the proposa l for a 
regulation on the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders, COM/2016/0819 final.  
 Besides, without going into detail on the scope of the whole European substantial framework relating to financial crimes, gen erally 
speaking that framework has a broad reach. Therefore, the conclusion we made for freezing and confiscation of property (it s scope 
being large enough already to capture cryptocurrencies), could very well also apply to the larger framework.

 56 PE 619.024  4.1.6.  Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater: the technology  
Cryptocurrencies run on ingenuous technology. From a law enforcement perspective, introducing 
mechanisms of accountability of crypto players should prevent this technology from being used 
largely for nefarious purposes, but at the same time not prevent technological innovation from 
happening308. Therefo re, legislative action should always be proportionate so that it addresses the 
illicit behaviour while at the same time not strangling technological innovation at birth. This is an 
aspect of particular relevance for this research. Cryptocurrencies run on b lockchain or other 
technology. This technology is perfectly legitimate and offers many advantages for innovation in 
multiple legitimate sectors, including the business and public sector . It has  for instance been 
suggested that blockchain technology could b e an adequate defense mechanism against  digital 
ransomware309. The idea  is that through blockchain technology sensiti ve information can be kept in a 
decentralized manner instead of centralized (as it is now). Keeping information in a decentralized 
manner mak es it harder to link the information to the person it relates to. It is then also harder to 
know who to address for the ransom. Moreover, there would be numerous copies of the info, making 
it extremely difficult for criminals to hold them all to ransom. An other deterring factor could be that 
attacking a decentralized system of information would be easily visible to its participants.310 Another 
example of a legitimate use case  of blockchain technology for the greater good can be found in 
China311, where blockcha in is being used to combat tax fraud in the context of a  partnership between 
Tencent and the Shenzhen national taxation bureau .312  
If cryptocurrencies are used for criminal purposes, it is therefore not the technology that needs to be 
addressed. On the cont rary, it is the illicit use that should be targeted. Exceptionally, however, an 
exception can be made in well -defined cases, such as the mixing technique used in the context of 
Dash  and Monero's RingCT313, stealth addresses and Kovri -project .314

PE 619.024  57 This approach is recognized by the European Commission in the build -up to its proposal to amend 
AMLD4315, as will be discussed hereinafter. In that context, the Commission stressed that the 
proposed measures have no negative effects on the benefits and technological advances presented 
by the distributed ledger technology underlying virtual currencies, including innovative ways for 
governments to reduce fraud, corruption, error and the cost of paper- intensive processes, set in place 
new, modern ways in which governments and  citizens interact, in terms of data sharing, transparency 
and trust, and provide novel insights into establishing ownership and provenance for goods and 
intellectual property.  
4.1.7.  The tide is changing: AMLD5  
As we will analyse further in this research, the E uropean tide is changing. At the time of writing of this 
research new European rules on money laundering and terrorist financing are in the final phase of 
being adopted. These rules include measures to pull cryptocurrencies and (some) crypto players out 
of the regulatory dark. Hence, the regulatory approach taken by the EU is to address cryptocurrencies 
and crypto players via the rules on money laundering and terrorist financing.  
As a final introductory side note, from a conceptual perspective, the EU coul d have also done this via 
other types of legislation, such as financial services legislation. That would have also pulled 
cryptocurrencies and crypto players out of the dark and into the light, and even more, e.g. relevant 
crypto players would have needed a license.316 As we will see further on, this option, from a policy 
perspective, was not preferred at this stage.  
Hereinafter we will elaborate on the new European framework on cryptocurrencies and crypto  
players in the context of combating money laundering  and terrorist financing. We will start the 
analysis by highlighting the background of the legislative framework. After that, we will briefly 
discuss the current framework. Subsequently, the legislative road to the upcoming framework and 
the upcoming frame work itself will be scrutinized. Lastly, two add -ons to the framework of 
combating money laundering and terrorist financing wil l be briefly touched upon, the Funds Transfer 
Regulation an d the Cash Control R egulation, to verify whether cryptocurrencies are in scope of these 
regulations.

316  At present it is generally speaking very difficult, if not impossible, to include cryptocu rrencies and players within the existing scope of 
financial services legislation. A numbers of examples to illustrate this can be given. First, the scope of various rules is c onnected to the 
concept financial instruments, such as market abuse rules or MiFI D rules. When we look at the definition of “financial instruments”, it is 
very difficult to include cryptocurrencies within that definition. Therefore, cryptocurrencies will probably not be financial  instruments. 
This means that MiFID licensing rules and b ehavioural rules for that reason alone cannot be attached to cryptocurrency players, such as 
cryptocurrency exchange platforms or wallet providers. A second example is that of the prospectus regulation. This uses as co nnecting 
factor “securities”. Taking a  close look at the definition of "securities", it seems that cryptocurrencies do not fit easily within this 
definition. But more importantly, prospectus requirements are connected to an issuer. In the context of cryptocurrencies, the re will not 
be an issue r (yet, sometimes, there is an offeror, to which theoretically rules could be attached; see infra). A third example is that o f 
payment services. In view of the various components of the definition of payment services it seems difficult to include servi ce p roviders 
in relation to cryptocurrencies within that definition. Moreover, it can be expected that the provision of services related to payments by 
a service provider in the framework of cryptocurrency transactions will not constitute his ordinary professi on or business, exempting 
him anyway from the scope of PSD2. Dependent on the circumstances, also the limited network exception could serve as a safe h arbour 
for the offered services. A last example is that of the e -money rules. It is very clear that crypt ocurrencies do not fit within the definition 
of e -money, exempting them from the scope of these rules. See for a regulatory analysis e.g. R . HOUBEN , "Bitcoin: there two sides to 
every coin", ICCLR, Vol. 26, Issue 5, 2015, 193 -208; P . VALCKE , N. VANDEZANDE  and N. VAN DE VELDE , "The evolution of third party payment

 58 PE 619.024  4.2. Money laundering and terrorist financing  
4.2.1.  Background  
The fight against money laundering and terrorism financing is a key priority of the international 
community, including the EU. It has long been established that money laundering activities are 
usually carried out in an international context and therefore national measures are not sufficient. The 
Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (" FATF ") – drawn up in 1990 and revised from 
time to time – are the cornerstone o f the international framework for combating money laundering 
and terrorist financing. They have been endorsed by over 180 countries, and are universally 
recognised as setting out the international standards.317 
The European Union adopted its first Anti -Money  Laundering D irective on 10 June 1991 (" AMLD1 ").318 
An anti -money laundering framework at the level of the European Union was needed to coordinate 
measures across the different Member States and safeguard the stability of the financial system as a 
whole. Thi s first Anti -Money L aundering Directive was later amended by the second  Anti -Money 
Laundering D irective (" AMLD2 ")319, before being repealed and replaced by the third  Anti -money 
Laundering D irective (" AMLD3 ").320 The latter introduced the fight against terroris t financing and 
included the revised 2003 FATF Recommendations.321 In February 2012, the FATF published a revised 
set of its Recommendations.322 In parallel, the Commission u ndertook a review of the third Anti -
Money Laundering D irective, which needed to be upd ated and aligned with the 2012 FATF 
Recommendations. On 20 May 2015 a revised anti -money laundering and counter- terrorism 
financing framework was adopted which substantially changed the EU’s existing legal framework 
designed to protect the financial system  against money laundering and terrorist financing. The 
revis ed rules consist of the fourth Anti -Money Laundering D irective (" AMLD4 ")323 and the EU Funds 
Transfer R egulation (" FTR ")324 and provide for a more targeted and focused risk -based approach .325

PE 619.024  59 terrorism financing more effective. AMLD4 should have been transposed by Member States on 26 
June 2017 at the latest. As of the same date, also the FTR becam e applicable.  
4.2.2.  AMLD4  
The core principle of AMLD4 is the prohibition of money laundering and terrorist financing .326  
What is money laundering? Technically, the following conduct is money laundering, when committed 
intentionally:  
a) the conversion or transfer of property, knowing that such property is derived from criminal 
activity or from an act of participation in such activity, for the purpose of concealing or disguising 
the illicit origin of the property or of assisting any person  who is involved in the commission of 
such an activity to evade the legal consequences of that person's action;  
b) the concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement, rights 
with respect to, or ownership of, property, kno wing that such property is derived from criminal 
activity or from an act of participation in such an activity;  
c) the acquisition, possession or use of property, knowing, at the time of receipt, that such property 
was derived from criminal activity or from an  act of participation in such an activity;  
d) participation in, association to commit, attempts to commit and aiding, abetting, facilitating and 
counselling the commission of any of the actions referred to in points a, b and c327.  
In more simple terms money la undering can be explained as the process by which proceeds of 
criminal activity are "cleaned" and brought into the lawful economy so that their illegal origins are 
concealed or disguised .328 
In the application of the definition of money laundering, " property " means assets of any kind, whether 
corporeal or incorporeal, movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, and legal documents or 
instruments in any form including electronic or digital, evidencing title to or an interest in such 
assets.329  
Money laundering shall be regarded as such even where the activities which generated the property 
to be laundered were carried out in the territory of a third country .330 
What is terrorist financing? This is defined as the provision or collection of funds, by any means, 
directly or indirectly, with the intention that they be used or in the knowledge that they are to be 
used, in full or in part, in order to carry out any of the offences within the meaning of Articles 1 to 4 of 
Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA on comba ting terrorism .331 The offenses referred to are 
intentional acts which given their nature or context, may seriously damage a country or an 
international organisation where committed with the aim of seriously intimidating a population, or 
unduly compelling a government or international organisation to perform or abstain from 
performing any act, or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, 
                                                             
326  Article 1, 1 and 2 AMLD4.  
327  Article 1, 3 AMLD4. 
328  E.g. I. BANTEKAS  and S. NASH, International Criminal Law , Routledge -Cavendish,  2007,  247; S. ROYER , “Bitcoins in het Belgische strafrecht en 
strafprocesrecht ”, RW 2016 -17, No. 13, 491. Generally, there are three steps: the placement phase where the profit s generated by the 
criminal activity must be separated from the criminal activity itself (e.g. dirty money is placed with other legitimate money in the 
system), the layering phase during which steps are taken to disguise the route which the money takes dur ing the laundering process 
and the integration phase where the money must become available for use by the criminal organisation. 
329  Article 3, (3) AMLD4. 
330  Article 1, 4 AMLD4. 
331  Article 1, 5 AMLD4.  IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies  
 
 60 PE 619.024  economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation. Are deemed to be terrorist 
offences: attacks upon a person's life which may cause death, attacks upon the physical integrity of a 
person, kidnapping or hostage taking, causing extensive destruction to a government or public 
facility, a transport system, an infras tructure facility, including an information system, a fixed platform 
located on the continental shelf, a public place or private property likely to endanger human life or 
result in major economic loss, etc.  
A difference between terrorist financing and mon ey laundering is that in the event of terrorist 
financing, the origin of the funds can be legitimate. It is the destination of the funds, i.e.  financing 
terrorists, that makes the whole deal illegitimate.332 Money laundering on the contrary is by definition 
based on another crime which gives rise to the laundering in question.333 
There is no definition of " funds " included in AMLD4. Legal doctrine opines that it should have the 
same meaning as " property " under AMLD4, especially given that such approach would be consistent 
with the FATF recommendations .334  
Ratione personae  AMLD4 applies to so -called obliged entities. Because these obliged entities are the 
entry -point for money laundering and terrorist financing requirements, they are sometimes also 
referred to as t he "gatekeepers" .335  
The obliged entities include: credit institutions, financial institutions, a well defined list of natural or 
legal persons acting in the exercise of their professional activities (under which auditors, external 
accountants, tax advisors, notaries and other independent legal professionals), trust or company 
service providers, estate agents, other persons trading in goods to the extent that payments are 
made or received in cash in an amount of EUR 10.000 or more and providers of gambling s ervices .336  
In addition, Member States are required to extend the scope of AMLD4 in whole or in part to 
professions and categories of undertakings, other than the obliged entities referred to above, which 
engage in activities which are particularly likely t o be used for the purposes of money laundering or 
terrorist financing .337 This implies a continuous monitoring by Member States of money laundering 
and terrorist financing risks within their territory and taking action when they discover vulnerabilities.  
When an entity is an obliged entity and thus falls within the remit of AMLD4, it is subject to various 
requirements, which ultimately aim at tracing financial information and having a deterrent effect on 
money laundering and terrorist financing .338 
An important requirement is that obliged entities have to perform customer due diligence when 
establishing a business relationship, when carrying out an occasional transaction that amounts to 
EUR 15.000 or more, when there is a suspicion of money laundering o r terrorist financing, regardless 
of any derogation, exemption or threshold, when there are doubts about the veracity or adequacy of 
previously obtained customer identification data, etc.339 Customer due diligence measures comprise 
among others identifying t he customer and verifying his/her identity, identifying beneficial owners

of the business relationship, the business and risk profile.340   
Another important requirement is that when obliged entities know, suspect or have reasonable 
grounds to suspect that funds, regardless of the amount involved, are the proceeds of criminal 
activity or are related to terrorist financing, they have to inform the competent financ ial intelligence 
unit (" FIU"), which every Member State must establish in order to prevent, detect and effectively 
combat money laundering and terrorist financing, and provide it with all necessary information. All 
suspicious transactions, including attemp ted transactions, must be reported .341 The FIU in turn 
analyses the suspicious transactions. It disseminates the results of its analyses to the competent 
authorities where there are grounds to suspect money laundering, associated predicate offences or 
terrorist financing .342 Because money -laundering and terrorist financing is not bound by borders, it is 
evident that FIUs have to cooperate and exchange information with each other to the greatest extent 
possible, regardless of their organisational status.343  
When obliged entities fail their duties under AMLD4, they can be sanctioned. AMLD4 demands that 
any such sanction must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Furthermore, and more in general, 
competent authorities should have at their disposal an adequate sanctioning toolbox, as further 
detailed under AMLD4, enabling them to adequately sanction breaches of the national provisions 
transposing AMLD4 .344 
An important innovation of AMLD4 is the so -called beneficial ownership register. This relates to the 
mandator y set- up of a central register345 comprising info on the beneficial ownership of corporate 
and other legal entities. When obliged entities are taking customer due diligence measures, the 
information on beneficial ownership must be provided to them. Also shou ld the information be 
accesible by competent authorities and FIUs. Other persons than competent authorities and FIUs who 
are able to demonstrate a legitimate interest with respect to money laundering, terrorist financing, 
and the associated predicate offences, such as corruption, tax crimes and fraud, will also be granted 
access to beneficial ownership information, in accordance with data protection rules .346  
AMLD4 contains various provisions relating to the relation with high -risk third countries. Firstly, 
obliged entities must apply an enhanced level of customer due diligence when dealing with natural 
persons or legal entities established in high- risk third countries identified by the Commission.347 
Furthermore, reliance on third parties established in high- risk third countries is prohibited .348 AMLD4 
is also conscious of the fact that money laundering and terrorist financing are international problems 
and the effort to combat them should be global. One of the illustrations is that Member States should 
ensure that their FIUs exchange information freely, spontaneously or upon request, with third -
country FIUs, having regard to Union law and to the principles relating to information exchange

4.2.3.  Cryptocurrencies under AMLD4  
Are transactions in cryptocurrencies included in the scope of AMLD4? Although there is some 
scholarly debate on this350, it is fair to say that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to stretch the scope 
of AMLD4 so far as to include cryptocurrency transactions .351 
A surmountable hurdle for cryptocurrencies to be included in the scope of AMLD4 is the connecting 
factor " property " or " funds ". As aforementioned, property – and arguably, funds – Is defined as assets 
of any kind, whether corporeal or incorporeal, movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, and 
legal documents or instruments in any form including electronic or digital, evidencing title to or an 
interest in such assets. Although not written for cryptocurrencies, at first glance, this definition is 
broad enough to also include cryptocurrencies, as they could be seen as incorporeal immovable 
assets for the purposes of AMLD4 .352 
An insurmountable hurdle, however, is that of the list of  obliged entities. None of the players in the 
cryptocurrency scheme, regardless of which cryptocurrency is concerned, is directly or indirectly 
included in the list of obliges entities, not even crypto  exchanges. Therefore, the AMLD4 framework 
simply cannot be attached to the crypto scheme, exempting it fully from the AMLD4 scope.  
This also came to the attention of the European Commission in 2016, which initiated legislative action 
to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers under the scope of the 
AMLD in the future .353 The coming of age of this inclusion into the AMLD framework will be 
elaborated hereinafter. It is not the intention to discuss all steps that were taken, but  only to highlight 
the important steps, ultimately with the aim to create a better understanding of where the final 
results and policy choices came from.  
4.2.4.  The coming of age of the inclusion of cryptocurrencies into AMLD5354 
a. Preliminary remark: the terminology  
Prior to deep diving into the coming of age of the inclusion of cryptocurrencies into AMLD5, we  note 
that most of the policy documentation  uses the  term  "virtual currencies" instead of cryptocurrencies.  
Important for this research is that crypt ocurrencies are a subcategory of virtual currencies, more 
particularly that kind of virtual currencies that have a bi -directional link to the real economy. 
Therefore, when throughout this analysis of the regulatory framework we refer to virtual currencies,  
this includes cryptocurrencies . Moreover,  when we look at the exact scope of the definitions included  
in the various policy documentation, there is a clear tendency towards targeting cryptocurrencies  
                                                             
349  AMLD5 provides for additional measures, such as a requirement for Member States to refuse the establishment of subsidiaries o r 
branches or representative offices of obliged entities from a high risk third country or prohibit obliged entities from establishing 
branches or representative offices in such a country (new Article 18a). 
350  It has e.g. been argued that crypto -exchanges and platforms that exchange ‘virtual currency’ into fiat money c ould fall within the 
definition of ’financial institutions’ as set out in article 3(2)(a) of AMLD4, as this definition also includes the activitie s of “currency 
exchange offices” (see: C.  HAUBEN , “Bitcoin en EU -recht: de virtuele vreemde eend in de bijt” i n M. E. STORME  and F. HELSEN  (eds.), Innovatie 
en disruptie in het economisch recht , Antwerpen, Intersentia , 2017, 87), though this reasoning is not generally accepted.

PE 619.024  63 with these definitions and not or only to a lesser exten t other kinds of virtual currencies that have only 
a one directional or no link to the real economy.   
b. The 2014 E BA opinion on virtual currencies  
A first important step towards including the cryptocurrency scheme into the AMLD framework, is an 
opinion of the European Banking Authority in 2014 on virtual currencies .355  
In this report the EBA advocates a comprehensive regulatory approach towards virtual currencies 
over time.356 Preferably this is done through designing a tailored regulatory regime along the lines of 
the following characteristics: creating a virtual currency scheme governance authority that is 
accountable to the regulator, customer due diligence requirements, fitness and probity standards for 
individuals performing specified functions in a scheme  governance body, exchange or other relevant 
market participants, mandatory incorporation in an EU Member State, transparent price formation 
and requirements against market abuse, authorisation and corporate governance requirements, 
capital requirements, evidence of secure IT systems, payment guarantee and refunds requirements, 
separation of virtual currency schemes from conventional payment systems and a global regulatory 
approach.  
As a more immediate response, the EBA recommends to include market partici pants at the direct 
interface between conventional and virtual currencies, such as virtual currency exchanges, in the 
scope of the AMLD as ‘obliged entities’ and thus subject these to anti -money laundering and counter-
terrorist financing requirements.  
According to the EBA, this immediate response will ‘shield’ regulated financial services from virtual 
currency schemes, and will mitigate those risks that arise from the interaction between virtual 
currency schemes and regulated financial services. Other things being equal, this immediate 
response, according to the EBA, will allow virtual currency schemes to innovate and develop outside 
of the financial services sector, including the development of solutions that would satisfy regulatory 
demands on the longer term.  
None of these options were eventually retained by the European legislator: no tailored framework 
was developed for virtual currencies, nor were the EBA's suggestions to expand the scope of the 
AMLD followed in the course of the -  then ongoing - revis ion that led to the AMLD4.  
c. The Council Invite  
The momentum changed after the terrorist attacks in France. In meetings held in December 2015, the 
European Council concluded that rapid further action against terrorist finance was required. 
Following up on th is, the Council on 12 February 2016 underlined the importance of achieving rapid 
progress on legislative actions identified by the Commission, including in the field of virtual 
currencies .357 Therefore, it called upon the Commission to submit targeted amendm ents to AMLD4 
and if necessary to the revised Directive on Payment Services (" PSD2 ") and to the Cash Control 
Regulation.

 64 PE 619.024  d. The Commission's Supranational Risk Assessment 
On 26 June 2017, the European Commission released its report on the assessment of the ri sks of 
money laundering and terrorist financing affecting the internal market and relating to cross -border 
activities (also referred to as the " Supranational Risk Assessment ").358 In its report the Commission 
identified virtual currencies as potentially vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing 
risks affecting the internal market. More in general, the Commission rightly identifies anonymity in 
financial transactions as a vulnerability common to all sectors, including the anonymity related to 
virtual currencies. Their anonymity features place an intrinsic limitation on identification and 
monitoring possibilities. The Commission goes as far as recommending Member States to extend 
already the list of obliged entities in the application of Article 4 o f the AMLD4 and to consider 
including at least virtual currency exchange platforms and wallet providers in AMLD4's scope. 
e. The Commission's Impact Assessment accompanying the AMLD5 proposal  
In the build -up to a legislative proposal to amend the AMLD4, the C ommission conducted an 
extensive impact assessment (" Impact Assessment ")359. The Impact Assessment acknowledges the 
problem that suspicious transactions made through virtual currencies are not sufficiently monitored 
by the authorities, which are unable to li nk identities and transactions, mainly because of the 
anonymity surrounding virtual currencies and because of virtual currency schemes and their 
participants (users (traders, suppliers, customers), 'miners', currency exchange platforms, wallet 
providers, … ) not being regulated.   
Particularly interesting are the potential regulatory answers to address this problem. According to the 
Impact Assessment, these are the following.  
i. First option: target users, including consumers and retailers using virtual currenc ies as an investment 
product or as a means of exchange for buying/selling products or services.  
The Impact Assessment sees two ways to lift the anonymity of users. The first one is through the 
mandatory registration of users (option A). The second one is s ofter and reduces virtual currencies' 
anonymity through the voluntary self -registration of users (option B). This option would not eradicate 
anonymity, but would allow authorities combating financial crime to rapidly verify identities of 
registered users.  
ii. Second option: target virtual currency exchange platforms  
Again, the Impact Assessment suggests two ways forward. The first one is to make exchange 
platforms obliged entities under AMLD4 (option C), submitting them inter alia  to customer due 
diligence req uirements. The second way forward is to bring virtual currency exchange platforms 
under the scope of PSD2 (option D). PSD2 goes further than AMLD4. On top of the anti -money 
laundering and counter- terrorist financing requirements which it automatically impo ses by reference 
                                                             
358  ECOM(2017) 340 final. The  Supranational Risk Assessment (“SNRA ”) was the final product of a review by the Commission of anti -money 
laundering and terrorist financing risks at Union level in the application of Article 6 of AMLD4. The SNRA was accompanied by  an 
elaborate Commission Staff Working Document in which among o thers the money laundering and terrorist financing risks relating to 
virtual currencies are detailed (SWD(2017) 241 final). On the one hand, the risk levels relating to virtual currencies in the  context of 
money laundering and terrorist financing are estim ated moderately significant, which is a level 2 risk on a scale of 1 (low) to 4 (high 
risk): while terrorists or other criminals may have a high intent to use virtual currencies' due to their characteristics (anonymity in 
particular), the level of capabili ty is lower due to high technology required. On the other hand, virtual currency schemes are assessed to 
be highly vulnerable for terrorist financing and money laundering, because they are not regulated in the EU.

European Parliament and the Council amending Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for  the

PE 619.024  65 to AMLD4, PSD2 also establishes a licensing obligation for regulated entities, minimum capital 
requirements, safeguarding requirements, and consumer protection rules. This way forward is, hence, 
more burdensome for exchanges.  
iii. Third option : target custodian wallet providers  
As for the first and second option, the Impact Assessment suggests two possible actions, which are 
similar to the approaches suggested for exchange providers, hence: respectively bringing them under 
the scope of AMLD4 (o ption E) or under the scope of PSD2 (option F).  
Why are only custodian wallet providers targeted? The rationale  of the Impact Assessment is that 
software wallet providers only provide applications or programs running on users' hardware to access 
public in formation from a distributed ledger and access the network. Therefore, they are only a 
technical service provider. Custodian wallet providers on the contrary have custody over the user’s 
public and private key, making them from a conceptual perspective qui te similar to financial 
institutions holding bank or payment accounts. Therefore, they warrant more regulatory attention.   
iv. Evaluation of the options  
Having consulted relevant stakeholders, the Impact Assessment evaluates that there is a need to have 
gatekeepers that manage the control of users' identities when needed. In that respect, an 
overwhelming majority of Member States favoured option C over D, hence make virtual currency 
exchange platforms obliged entities under AMLD4 instead of including them  in the scope of PSD2 .360 
The options envisaging custodian wallet providers were apparently not in scope of the debate with 
the stakeholders, although some Member States nevertheless expressed a preference to include 
these in the scope of AMLD4, instead of i n the scope of PSD2. Generally, any option involving PSD2 
was thus not welcomed by most Member States. They believed that this would give too much 
legitimacy to virtual currencies and drive consumers to believe virtual currencies are safe and sound 
product s, which they are not, according to the various warnings financial supervisors all across the 
globe have issued.  
The virtual currency industry itself appeared to be generally favourable to legislation for two reasons: 
it would give them more legitimacy an d it would help to differentiate between bona -fide users and 
criminals.  
The options involving registration of users were apparently only tested with some relevant 
stakeholders (i.e. consumers/users, experts), resulting in a preference for non- mandatory re gistration.  
f. The Commission's AMLD5 Proposal  
In its proposed fifth revision of the AMLD (" Commission Proposal ")361, launched on 5 July 2016, the 
Commission eventually takes the approach of including both virtual currency exchanges (defined as 
"providers enga ged primarily and professionally in exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat 
currencies ") and custodian wallet providers (defined as " wallet providers offering custodian services of 
credentials necessary to access virtual currencies") in the s cope of the AMLD and to label these as 
obliged entities. Consequently, going forward these entities will have to apply customer due 
                                                             
360  All Member States were consulted and 27 supported option C with one exception having a preference for option D. Option E was also 
envisaged by some Member States even though not presented in the questionnaire.

 66 PE 619.024  diligence controls when exchanging virtual for fiat currencies, ending the anonymity associated with 
such exchanges and such  wallet providers, and report suspicious transactions to the competent FIU. 
In addition, virtual currency exchanges and custodian wallet providers will need to be licensed or 
registered; apparently the Commission leaves the option between licensing and reg istration open.  
For legal certainty reasons, the Commission also proposes a definition of the term " virtual currency ": "a 
digital representation of value that is neither issued by a central bank or a public authority, nor necessarily 
attached to a fiat cur rency, but is accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of payment and can be 
transferred, stored or traded electronically ".  
As regards user registration, the Commission takes no immediate action. Instead, it commits itself to 
including in its next supranational risk assessment, which is due by 26 June 2019, if necessary, 
appropriate proposals, including, where appropriate, with respect to virtual currencies, 
empowerments to set -up and maintain a central database registering users' identities and wal let 
addresses accessible to FIUs, as well as self -declaration forms for the use of virtual currency users.  
This does, however, not mean that users remain completely out of scope of the Commission Proposal. 
More in particular, users are targeted indirectly  insofar they hold their virtual currencies via a 
custodian wallet provider or enter into virtual currency transactions via a virtual currency exchange 
platform. These users can no longer be anonymous, because of the customer due diligence 
requirements ves ted upon the custodian wallet provides and virtual currency exchange platforms .362 
All other users remain out of scope (for now).  
g. The updated EBA Opinion  
Following the Commission Proposal, the EBA published an update of its 2014 opinion on virtual 
currencies . The EBA welcomes this proposal as an important step to mitigate some of the financial 
crime risks arising from the use of virtual currencies. The EBA furthermore endorses the Commission's 
approach not to include virtual currency transactions in the scope of PSD2 for the time being, given 
the short time frame within which the Commission was asked to develop its proposals. Including such 
transactions within the scope of PSD2 requires further legal and business model analysis, the EBA 
opines. Moreover, the E BA seems to still favour a separate and tailored regulatory regime, the 
elements of which it proposed in its 2014 Opinion. To that end, the EBA invites the Commission to 
initiate as soon as possible the comprehensive analysis that is needed for assessing w hich, if any, 
regulatory regime would be most suitable for virtual currency transactions.  
h. The 2016 ECB opinion on the Commission's proposal  
In addition to the EBA, also the ECB, on 12 October 2016, released a report on the Commission 
Proposal .363 In that rep ort the ECB strongly supports including virtual currency exchange platforms 
and custodian wallet providers into the list of obliged entities, as well requiring them to be licensed 
or registered. The ECB, however, also expresses some concerns, under which t hat, while it is 
appropriate to regulate virtual currencies for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, 
regulation should not seek to promote a wider use of virtual currencies. Furthermore, the ECB makes 
technical comments relating to the definition of virtual currencies, that were later picked up in the 
compromise text, discussed hereinafter364.

PE 619.024  67 i. Discussion in in Parliament  
The Commission Proposal was thoroughly studied by members of the European Parliament 
throughout 2016 and 2017. An extensive report was adopted suggesting several amendments.365 
Particularly interesting are the suggestions made by the Committee on Legal Affairs of 18 January 
2017. The Committee proposes to expand the scope of AMLD significantly as regards virtual 
currencies, so as to include virtual currency exchange platforms, custodian wallet providers, issuers, 
administrators, intermediaries and distributors of virtual currencies, and administrators and providers 
of systems for online payments. This is very broad and potentially brings all virtual currency service 
providers under the AMLD's scope. This has been criticized by some legal doctrine to the extent the 
scope also includes purely technical service providers, such as miners of cryptocurrencies, or is simply 
not realistic, because there is no central issuer – as is the case for many cryptocurrencies .366  
Furthermore, the Committee on Legal Affairs is of the opinion that to combat the risks related to 
anonymity, national FIUs should be able to associate virtual currency address es to the identity of the 
owner of virtual currencies. 
The scope extensions were not picked up in the Compromise Text, which is analyzed hereinafter.  
j. The Compromise Text  
On 13 December 2017, and following the technical work thereafter, a provisional agreem ent was 
reached between the Parliament and the Council on AMLD5, which resulted in a  final compromise .367 
This was formally adopted by the European Parliament in plenary o n 19 April 2018.368 On 14 May 
2018, the Council approved the European Parliament's position at first reading .369 AMLD5 will enter 
into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication  in the Official Journal of the European 
Union.370 Member S tates will have  to bring into force laws, regulations and administrative provisions 
neces sary to comply with AMLD5 by 10 January 2020 . 
Overall , the adopted Compromise Text  is in line with the Commission Proposal. Nevertheless, there 
are some differences.  
Firstly, the Compromise Text uses different wording to include virtual currency exchange services and  
custodian wallet provide rs in the list of obliged entities (the changes compared to the Commission 
Proposal are marked hereinafter: " providers engaged371 in exchange services between virtual 
currencies and fiat currencies and custodian wallet providers "372.

370  AMLD5 was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 19 June 2018. See: Directive (EU) 2018/843 of the Europe an 
Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for 
the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, and amending Directives 2009/138/EC and 2013/36/EU, OJ L 156, 19 June 
2018, 43 (electronically available via: https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018L0843&from=EN ).   
371  Hence, the qualifier of “primarily and professionally” was dropped, meaning that also those providing these services occasion ally would 
be caught under the scope. Vandezande raises the question of whether a virtual currency user, who on a non- commercial ba sis – for 
instance as a gesture to a friend –  exchanges some units of virtual currency for legal tender or similar instruments, could become an IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies  
 
 68 PE 619.024  Secondly, the Compromise Text uses a slightly different definition of virtual currencies. More in 
particular, it defines virtual currencies as " a digital representation of value that is not issued or 
guaranteed by a central bank or a public au thority, is not necessarily attached to a legally established 
currency, and does not possess a legal status of currency or money, but is accepted by natural or legal 
persons, as a means of exchange, and which can be transferred, stored and traded electroni cally " (the 
changes compared to the Commission Proposal are marked hereinafter: " a digital representation of 
value that is not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority, is not necessarily 
attached to a legally established currency, and does not possess a legal status of currency or money, 
but is accepted by natural or legal persons, as a means of exchange, and which can be transferred, 
stored and traded electronically").  
Thirdly, a definition of “custodian wallet provider” ("an entity that provides services to safeguard 
private cryptographic keys on behalf of their customers, to hold, store and transfer virtual currencies") 
is included. Such a definition was not included in the Commission Proposal.  
Fourthly, the Compromise Text is more pr ecise on whether exchange platforms and custodian wallet 
providers should be licensed or registered: they should be registered (the changes compared to the 
Commission Proposal are marked hereinafter: " ensure that providers of exchange services between 
virtual currencies and fiat currencies, and custodian wallet providers, are registered").  
The obligation for the Commission to assess the desirability of a (voluntary) registration of users in 
the course of its next supranational risk assessment, due by 26 Jun e 2019, is unchanged . 
4.2.5.  Fund s Transfer R egulation  
As aforementioned, the anti -money laundering framework as introd uced in 2015 also includes the 
Funds Transfer R egulation or FTR. It is interesting to see whether this regulation somehow is a useful 
instrument to combat the illicit use of cryptocurrencies.   
The FTR lays down rules on the information on payers373 and payees374 accompanying transfers of 
funds, in any currency, for the purposes of preventing, detecting and investigating money laundering 
and terrorist financing (as defined under AMLD4), where at least one of the payment service 
providers375 involved in the transfer of funds is established in the Union. Particularly, the FTR requires 
the payment service provider of the payer to ensure that transfers of funds are accompanied by the 
name of the payer, the payer's payment account number, the payer's address, official personal 
document number, customer identification number or date and place of birth, the name of the payee 
and the payee's payment account number376, absent which he cannot execute any transfer of 
funds .377 The payment service provider of the payee is required to  detect missing information on the 
                                                                                                                                                                                                   
obliged entity under the anti -money laundering framework: N.  VANDEZANDE , Virtual currencies: a legal framework , Antwerp, Intersentia, 
2018,  292. 
372  The proposed Preamble 7a elaborates on the difference with e -money: virtual currencies should not to be confused with electronic 
money as defined in the e -money Directive nor with the larger concept of "funds" as defined  in point (25) of Article 4 of PSD2 nor with 
monetary value stored on instruments exempted as specified in Article 3(k) and 3(l) of PSD2, nor with in- games currencies, that can be 
used exclusively within the specific game environment. Whilst they could fre quently be used as a means of payment, they may also be 
used for other different purposes and find broader applications such as means of exchange, investment purposes, store -of-value 
products or uses in online casinos. The objective of AMLD5, the Preamble continues, is to cover all the potential uses of virtual 
currencies. The exact added value of this Preamble is not very clear.  
373  "Payer" means a person that holds a payment account and allows a transfer of funds from that payment account, or, where there  is no 
payment account, that gives a transfer of funds order (Article 3, (3) FTR).  
374  "Payee’ means a person that is the intended recipient of the transfer of funds (Article 3, (3) FTR).  
375  "Payment service provider" means inter alia  the categories of payment service providers referred to in Article 1(1) of the former 
Payment Services Directive (Article 3, (5) FTR).  
376  Article 4, 1 and 2 FTR.  
377  Article 4(6) FTR.  Cryptocurrencies and blockchain  
 
PE 619.024  69 payer or the payee .378 Where the payment service provider of the payee becomes aware of missing or 
incomplete information, he must reject the transfer or ask for additional information.379 Furthermore, 
he is required to take into account missing or incomplete information on the payer or the payee as a 
factor when assessing whether a transfer of funds, or any related transaction, is suspicious and 
whether it is to be reported to the competent FIU in accordance with AMLD4. 
With some exceptions, the FTR applies to transfers of funds380, in any currency, which are sent or 
received by a payment service provider or an intermediary payment service provider established in 
the EU .381 "Funds" means banknotes and coins, scriptural money and e lectronic money .382  
Here's the rub: cryptocurrencies are none of those, and, hence out of scope. Moreover, crypto  
intermediaries as a rule will not be payment service providers or intermediate payment service 
providers in the meaning of the FTR383. This is a second reason why the FTR is not equipped to fight 
the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, apart from it not being designed with cryptocurrencies in mind, 
which is apparent from the information to be provided, especially the reference to account numbers.  
4.2.6.  Cash  Control R egulation  
As an add -on to its money laundering and terrorist financing framework, the EU enacted already in 
2005 rules on the control of cash entering or leaving the Union.384 These rules intend to address cash 
movements for illicit purposes. They  apply to significant movements of cash crossing the borders of 
the Union, i.e. ca sh movements equal to or above EUR 10.000 by any natural person entering or 
leaving the Union. Such a person must declare the cash movement, enabling customs authorities to 
gather information on the movements and, where appropriate, transmit that information to other 
authorities.   
In the context of the Cash Control R egulation, " cash " means: (a) bearer- negotiable instruments 
including monetary instruments in bearer form such a s travellers cheques, negotiable instruments 
(including cheques, promissory notes and money orders) that are either in bearer form, endorsed 
without restriction, made out to a fictitious payee, or otherwise in such form that title thereto passes 
upon deliv ery and incomplete instruments (including cheques, promissory notes and money orders) 
signed, but with the payee's name omitted; and (b) currency (banknotes and coins that are in 
circulation as a medium of exchange).385  
Can cryptocurrencies be included in t his definition? Remarkably, theoretically, there is an opening. 
Coins that are in circulation as a medium of exchange are in scope. Cryptocurrencies can be seen as 
such coins, which is also evidenced by the AMLD5 definition of virtual currencies.  
                                                             
378  Article 7 FTR.  
379  Article 8 FTR. 
380  "Transfer of funds" means any tra nsaction at least partially carried out by electronic means on behalf of a payer through a payment 
service provider, with a view to making funds available to a payee through a payment service provider, irrespective of whethe r the 
payer and the payee are th e same person and irrespective of whether the payment service provider of the payer and that of the payee 
are one and the same (Article 3, (9( FTR).  
381  Article 2 FTR.  Please note that the regulation also has EEA relevance.  
382  Article 3, (8) FTR.  
383  Also see the similar reasoning why crypto intermediaries are thought not to be in scope of the PSD2.  
384  Regulation (EC) No 1889/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on controls of cash entering or  leaving 
the Community , OJ L  309, 25 November 2005, 9 (electronically available via: https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -
content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32005R1889&from=EN ).  
385  The current 2005 fr amework is currently under revision and will be replaced by a new one, taking into account the development of new 
best practices in the implementation within the EU of international standards on combating money laundering and terrorism financing 
developed by the FATF ( https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/com_2016_825_en.pdf ). The proposed new  
framework extends the definition of cash to some i nstruments or methods of payment other than currency, such as cheques, traveller's 
cheques, gold and prepaid cards.  IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies  
 
 70 PE 619.024  Non ethel ess, it is clear that the Cash Control R egulation is not written with movements of 
cryptocurrencies in mind. It is written with physical movements of cash in mind, explaining inter alia 
the requirement to declare and the involvement of customs authorities.  Cryptocurrencies are 
normally not moved physically: when they move, they move digitally. This makes the cash control 
framework intrinsically unfit to track movements of cryptocurrencies. From a practical perspective, a 
scholarly debate on the inclusion of  cryptocu rrencies into the scope of the Cash Control R egulation, 
therefore, is not very useful. The one event wherein it could be of any use is when cryptocurrencies 
would be stored onto a portable carrier, such as an USB -stick, making that stick some sort of a bearer 
instrument, and this stick would be moved across the EU border. But even for this event, it does not 
help a lot to in clude it into the scope of the Cash Control R egulation. After all, even leaving aside 
issues of proportionality and data prote ction, it seems not very practical – and desirable –  to verify the 
content of every USB -stick or the like moving across Union borders.  
4.3. Tax evasion  
The second part of this research's analysis of the regulatory framework relates to tax evasion.  
As was already explained above386, the EU framework that is in place on the exchange of information 
in tax matters, specifically aiming at combating tax evasion, is not very well equipped to address the 
use of virtual currencies for tax evasion, because to be able to share information on this, authorities 
must have the information in the first place, which is being complicated, if not made impossible, by 
the anonymity surrounding cryptocurrencies.  
Salvation could lie in the anti -money laundering and counter- terrori st financing framework. To t he 
extent this framework unveils  anonymity, the relevant information is registered into a central 
database and the tax authorities are able to consult and use this information, the fight against tax 
evasion through cryptocurrenc y transactions could become more effective.  
Is this something that can be done already under the current AMLD framework?  
Firstly, it can be noted that the definition of "criminal activity" under AMLD4 includes tax crimes 
relating to direct taxes and indirect taxes, which are punishable by deprivation of liberty or a 
detention order for a maximum of more than one year.387 Hence, the use of illegal proceeds of tax 
crimes is in scope of AMLD4 and can constitute money laundering. Therefore, obliged entities who 
know, suspect or have reasonable grounds to suspect that proceeds stem from tax evasion must 
inform the competent FIU. The FIU will analyse the file and disseminate the results of its analysis to 
the competent authorities where there are grounds to suspect money laundering, associated 
predicate offences or terrorist financing. When it relates to a cross -border file the FIUs concerned 
have to cooperate and exchange the obtained information with each other to the greatest extent 
possible. In this respect, the AMLD4 imposes that differences between national law definitions of tax 
crimes can be no impediment to the ability of FIUs to exchange information or provide assistance to 
another FIU, to the greatest extent possible under their national law .388 
In the contex t of all this, FIUs and competent authorities should have access to the beneficial 
ownership register, allowing them to verify beneficial ownership of corporate and other legal entities. 
                                                             
386  See: setting the scene.  
387  Article 3, (4)(f) AMLD4 and Preamble 11 AMLD4.  
388  Article 57 AMLD4. In addition, according to Preamble 56 of the AMLD4, the exchange of information on cases identified by FIUs as 
possibly involving tax crimes should be without prejudice to the exchange of information in the field of taxation in accordance with 
Directive 2011/16 or in accordance with international  standards on the exchange of information and administrative cooperation in tax 
matters. As aforementioned, the latter directive does not help out a lot currently as regards fighting tax evasion via the us e of 
cryptocurrencies.   Cryptocurrencies and blockchain  
 
PE 619.024  71 This can be very helpful when these corporates or other legal entities are in fact set -up to mask their 
beneficial owners for purposes of tax evasion. Other persons than competent authorities and FIUs 
who are able to demonstrate a legitimate interest with respect to money laundering, terrorist 
financing, and the associated predicate offences, such as tax crimes, will also be granted access to 
beneficial ownership information, in accordance with data protection rules, as already 
aforementioned .389 
Is the tax administration a competent authority who can get access to the benefic ial ownership 
register ? There is no definition of what constitutes a " competent authority " under AMLD4, basically 
leaving it open for Member States to decide who the competent authorities within their respective 
territories are. At least theoretically, thi s could mean that the tax administration is not a competent 
authority. What is clear, however, is that within each Member State a competent authority should be 
able to initiate administrative or criminal proceedings against launderers of proceeds of tax cr imes. If 
not, that would probably be in breach of Article 58, 2 of AMLD4, requiring Member States to have in 
place and make available to competent authorities a sanctioning toolbox allowing them to 
adequately sanction breaches of the national provisions transposing AMLD4.  
However it may be, the fifth revision of the Directive on administrative cooperation in taxation in 
2016 (" DAC5 ") took away all doubt: as of 1 January 2018 tax authorities must have access to the 
information gathered in the context of comb ating money laundering and terrorist financing, 
including the beneficial ownership register.390   
AMLD5 acknowledges this established right .391 It explicitly lists tax authorities in the list of competent 
authorities that must be granted access to the benefici al ownership register.392 The tax administration 
is also explicitly recognized in Article 49 of the revised AMLD framework, requiring Member States to 
ensure that tax authorities when acting within the scope of the AMLD, have effective mechanisms to 
enable t hem to cooperate and coordinate domestically concerning the development and 
implementation of policies and activities to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. In this 
context, it is furthermore made clear that a request for assistance between co mpetent authorities 
cannot be refused on the grounds that the request is also considered to involve tax matters .393  
All these innovations brought by DAC5 and AMLD5 strengthen the tax authorities' toolbox to pick up 
the gauntlet against tax evasion, in addit ion to other competent authorities that may also have 
sanctioning powers in this field, such as public prosecutors.  
The above analysis is a general one. What does all of it mean for tax evasion through the use of 
cryptocurrencies? Well, under AMLD4 crypto currencies are not in scope because none of the crypto

content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L2258&from=EN ).  
391  As a side note, we mention that a similar clarification of the right to access information by tax authorities i s recently also envisaged in a 
pending proposal for a directive laying down rules facilitating the use of financial and other information for the prevention, detection, 
investigation or prosecution of certain criminal offences (COM (2018) 213), which is pe rceived as an add -on to the AMLD framework. 
This directive relates to financial information and bank account information contained in the centralised bank account registries. 
"Financial information" is defined rather broadly as any type of information or d ata which is held by FIUs to prevent, detect and 
effectively combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or any type of information or data which is held by public autho rities or by 
obliged entities for those purposes and which is available to FIU wit hout the taking of coercive measures under national law. This could 
be information relating to cryptocurrencies, so it seems. What is remarkable, however, is that nonetheless the proposed Pream ble 9 is 
clear about the tax authorities’ rights to information, the proposed text of the directive itself, particularly Article 3, is a lot less clear 
about this.

the AMLD framework to be accessed by the tax administration. Thus, this is not much of a help.  
Under AMLD5, virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers become obliged 
entities and cryptocurrencies -  via the concept " virtual currencies " - are brought in scope. So, insofar 
cryptocurrency is held through a custodian wallet provider o r transactions occur via a virtual currency 
exchange platform, there will be information available for the tax administration, as the case may be 
brought to the attention of the tax administration by an FIU reporting a suspicious transaction linked 
to tax evasion.   Cryptocurrencies and blockchain

 ADEQUACY OF THE REGU LATORY FRAMEWORK  
5.1. Introduction  
Now that we have a clear picture of the current and upcoming regulatory framework for combating 
money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion via cryptocurrencies, it is high time to analyse 
whether that framework is adequate to address the many challenges cryptocurrencies bring.  
The existing framework is not adequate. This we have already analysed above.  
How does the upcoming AMLD5 score and what would be a good way forward?  
We will hereinafter try to answer that question on the basis of a number of more technical sub -
questions394. The questions are the following. 
• Is the definition of virtual currencies sufficient to capture the cryptocurrencies that can be used to 
launder money, finance terrorists or evade taxes?  
• Is it enough to include only custodian wallet providers and virtual currency exchanges in the list 
of obliged entities ? 
• Does the AMLD5 framework allow to pull enough cryptocurrency users into the light?  
• Would it make se nse to extend the scope of the Funds Transfer Regulation and/or the C ash 
Control R egulation as to include cryptocurrency transactions?  
• Is there a need for a more comprehensive approach, introducing license requirements for 
cryptocurrency players?  
• Is it not best to outright ban some activities or aspects linked to cryptocurrencies?  
• Is the European level the appropriate level to tackle money laundering, terrorist financing and tax 
evasion via cryptocurrency transactions?  
It is not our intention to give the definitive answer to all the questions raised. What we do intend  is to 
give our analysis and to fuel the further debate.  
5.2. Is the definition of virtual currencies under AMLD5 sufficient?  
As a recall, the definition of virtual currencies under AMLD5 is the following: " a digital representation 
of value that is not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority, is not necessarily attached 
to a legally established currency, and does not possess a legal status of currency or money, but is accepted 
by natural or legal persons, as a means of exchange, and which can be transferred, stored and traded 
electronically ". 
5.2.1.  Conclusions on the basis of the taxonomy  
Referring back to our taxonomy of cryptocurrencies, we can conclude that almost all of the 
cryptocurrencies scrutinized fit within this definition. All of the cry ptocurrencies are: 
• a digital representation of value;  
• decentralized, i.e. not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority;  
• not attached to a legally established currency;  
                                                             
394  It is not our intention to give a comprehensive list of all the relevant sub -questions instrumental to asse ssing the framework's adequacy. 
The selected questions allow to draw some preliminary conclusions though.   IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies  
 
 74 PE 619.024  • not possessing the legal status of currency or money;  
• electronically transferable, storable and tradeable.  
The one element that could give rise to discussion is that of the cryptocurrencies having to be a 
means of exchange. The AMLD5 does not provide further guidance of what this means, but an 
acceptable inte rpretation is that the cryptocurrencies should be able to be used to facilitate the sale, 
purchase of trade of goods between parties and represent a standard of value that is accepted 
between the parties .395   
Two questions arise.  
Firstly, what if a cryptoc urrency is not accepted as a means of exchange now, but there is no intrinsic 
limitation preventing it from becoming a means of exchange in the future? This is for instance 
relevant for cryptocurrencies that are apparently not used as a means of exchange now, such as IOTA 
and NEO. But that may change. All depends on the willingness of parties to accept the cryptocurrency 
as a standard of value in their mutual dealings. As soon as that happens, they become a means of 
exchange and tumble into the scope of the definition of "virtual currencies" under AMLD5. Therefore, 
from the perspective of combating money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion, there is no 
big issue: normally, committing one of these offences via cryptocurrencies implies having done an 
exchange, implying the cryptocurrency used is a means of exchange and is included in the scope of 
AMLD5.         
Secondly, what if a cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange, but also and foremost an investment 
instrument? This is an extremely relevant qu estion, as it is very clear from high volatility and various 
warnings from  financial supervisors that some cryptocurrencies are considered an investment 
instrument by users, not in the least Bitcoin, which still has the highest market capitalisation of all  
cryptocurrencies. If the answer to this question would be that these cryptocurrencies are out of 
scope, this would mean that AMLD5's fruits all in all are very little. We argue against such an 
interpretation. AMLD5's definition requires cryptocurrencies t o be accepted as a means of exchange. 
It does not say that this should be the only or predominant function of the cryptocurrency. Therefore, 
it does not matter if the cryptocurrency is also or predominantly an investment instrument. Also in 
that event, the cryptocurrency is included in the scope of AMLD5. Furthermore, an argument can be 
derived from the fiat currency framework: a fiat currency can also be acquired and held for 
investment (speculation) purposes; this does not change the fiat currency's prima ry status of being a 
fiat currency.   
Therefore, we conclude that AMLD5's definition of virtual currencies is sufficient to combat money 
laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion via the cryptocurrencies included in our taxonomy. Of 
course, that taxo nomy is not exhaustive. Nevertheless, we believe that it is fairly representative for the 
cryptocurrencies that are out there, both from the perspective of market capitalisation and from the 
perspective of distinctive features. Therefore, we believe that o ur conclusion here, and the 
conclusions that follow below, should also be representative, although it cannot be ruled out that 
some conclusions may not or not to the same extent apply to cryptocurrencies that were not in scope 
of this research.  
5.2.2.  Other virtual currencies than cryptocurrencies  
Virtual currencies within the scope of AMLD5 are those that can be transferred, stored and traded 
electronically. There is no requirement that virtual currencies are bi -directionally transferable or 
                                                             
395  See: https://www.investopedia.com/term s/m/mediumofexchange.asp .  Cryptocurrencies and blockchain  
 
PE 619.024  75 tradeable against fi at currencies. This means, for instance, that virtual currencies that can be acquired 
with fiat money and then used only in the virtual world to buy goods or services and/or that are 
transferable or tradeable only against other virtual currencies, are also  included in the scope of the 
AMLD5 definition of virtual currencies.  
However, legal doctrine rightly analysed that this inclusion in the scope of AMLD5's definition of 
virtual currencies does not help a lot looking at the list of obliged entities .396 The analysis is that the 
list of obliged entities , and especially the reference to virtual currency exchanges as defined by 
AMLD5,  shows that the scope of the anti -money laundering regulation of virtual currencies is limited 
to certain bi -directional scheme virt ual currencies only. Other virtual currency schemes are not in 
scope, including virtual currency to virtual currency exchanges and virtual currencies used to attain 
goods and services without requiring exchange into legal tender or similar instruments, or the use of 
a custodian wallet provider397. This leaves a blind spot, allowing such activities to still result in money 
laundering or terrorist financing activities outside  of the scope of AMLD5.  
Is it a problem? Well, yes and no.  
No, because it is arguable  that some types of virtual currencies are of minor to no importance for 
money laundering or terrorist financing, for instance virtual currencies that can only be obtained and 
used in the virtual world and have no interaction with the real economy. This ma kes them not very 
useful for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes. Schemes allowing to acquire virtual 
currencies with fiat currency, but where the acquired virtual currency can only be used in the virtual 
environment suffer the same defect for  purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, given 
that no money can flow out of the system. Of course, it is possible that in such a scheme the acquired 
virtual currency can be used as a means of payment (e.g. when a person consents to receiving 
payment in virtual currency). Nevertheless, it is assessed that such a method is fairly unsuited for 
larger scale money laundering operations .398 Therefore, arguably predominantly the schemes 
allowing to acquire virtual currency against fiat money and allowi ng to sell virtual currency against 
fiat money pose the biggest threat, as they can be linked to cash both at the entry into and the exit 
from the virtual sphere.  
Yes, because the world of cryptocurrencies is a fast moving one and the network of acceptance of 
virtual currencies can grow, the Impact Assessment rightfully points out. If virtual currencies 
effectively become widely accepted and used, there might come a point in time when there will no 
longer be a need to convert virtual currencies back into fi at currencies. In other words, with a growing 
network of acceptance, the need to "cash- out" of virtual currencies and exchange them for fiat 
currencies might decrease over time. This trend would, according to the Impact Assessment, increase 
further if virt ual currencies would become less volatile. 
Therefore, it is important to closely follow -up and monitor the use cases of virtual currencies, and 
especially whether the use of virtual currencies within a virtual setting and without having to cash-
out again becomes increasingly important .399 When that would actually happen, the regulatory 
framework should follow and include these cases into its scope. Or, as the IMF points out more

 76 PE 619.024  broadly, the changing nature of the technology requires that regulation be flexib le and can be 
adapted to evolving circumstances .400 
5.3. Is it enough to include only custodian wallet providers and virtual 
currency exchanges in the list of obliged entities?  
5.3.1.  State of play  
We recall AMLD5’s definitions of custodian wallet providers and virtual currency exchanges. These are 
respectively: " an entity that provides services to safeguard private cryptographic keys on behalf of their 
customers, to hold, store and transfer virtual currencies" and " providers engaged in exchange services 
between virtual currencies and fiat currencies ". 
Above we have identified the key players in the cryptocurrency market: users, miners, cryptocurrency 
exchanges, trading platforms, wallet providers, coin inventors and offerors.  
Clearly, a number of these key players are n ot obliged entities under AMLD5.  
5.3.2.  Users  
Firstly, users are not obliged entities under AMLD5. Making them obliged entities would not make a 
lot of sense, as the AMLD framework for a large part focuses on intermediaries401. In any event, it 
would not be propor tionate402. So, this is fine.  
5.3.3.  Miners  
Secondly, miners are also not obliged entities. And, as for users and for the same reasons,  at first 
glance  making them obliged entities would probably make little sense. According to the Impact 
Assessment, there are mainly two reasons for not considering miners as obliged entities. Firstly, 
miners are considered to be more a sort of technical service providers  than gatekeepers between the 
virtual sphere and the real world. Secondly, miners are mostly located in China which would make 
any initiative largely impossible to enforce.  
Nevertheless, two critical observations can be made here. Firstly, miners can be c ryptocurrency users 
too, or, more commonly, parties who have made a new business out of mining cryptocurrencies to 
sell them for fiat currency or for other cryptocurrencies .403 Along the same lines it is not inconceivable 
that criminals start mining cryptocu rrencies to do the same -  if they are not already doing this .404 
Mining Bitcoins is probably hard to do for criminals, given that it requires massive server power and 
substantial knowhow, but the same is not necessarily true for other cryptocurrencies, which can be 
easier to mine and still from the own living room so to speak .405 Once mined, the cryptocurrencies can 
be linked to the real world. Secondly, we are not sure that mining is done from China predominantly. 
This is true for Bitcoins and probably also fo r other major coins requiring a certain level of

401  It of course also includes rules on  the beneficial ownership register. This can include info on cryptocurrency users to the extent these 
users are corporate or other legal entities.

Framework”, 15 J. Bus. & Sec. L. 157, 2016,  http://digitalcommons.law.msu.edu/jbsl , 182.

PE 619.024  77 sophistication to mine, but is it also true for the cryptocurrencies that are easier to mine? Because 
criminals may be attracted to the mining business, some commentators even advocate a "know your 
miner" po licy, at least with respect to the cryptocurrencies that run on permissioned blockchain 
technology (because for those that run on permissionless blockchain technology, it is hard to find out 
their identities)406.  
At present, the fact that the  mining business is succeptible for illegitimate use , appears to be 
underestimated . Going forward, increasing attention  should be devoted  to the risks that accompany 
it, especially in light of the number of cryptocurrencies that is minable (i.e. based on a  PoW consensus 
mechanism).  The exclusion of miners from AMLD5’s scope, currently leaves a blind spot in the EU's 
fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion.  
5.3.4.  Cryptocurrency exchanges  
Thirdly, we have identified cryptocurrency exchanges as relevant players. Most of these allow users to 
sell their cryptocurrency for fiat currency or buy new cryp tocurrency with fiat currency. It is clear from 
the definition of virtual currency exchanges in AMLD5 that cryptocurrency exchanges of this nat ure 
are obliged entities.  
However, there also pure cryptocurrency exchanges, only accepting payments in other 
cryptocurrencies, usually B itcoin. Insofar as these exchanges do not  also  qualify as custodian wallet 
providers, they  remain out of AMLD5's scope  because they have no dealings with fiat currency . This is 
a blind spot in the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion, because it can 
add an extra layer of disguise of the origin of the cryptocurrencies (when they later pass through an 
obliged entity) or simply allow that cryptocurrencies are used completely outside of the monitored 
system.   
The atomic swap, which i n its essence  is a pure cryptocurrency exchange 2.0, because it can function  
without the need of a third party , des erves special emphasis . As other p ure cryptocurrency exchanges 
it is outside of the scope of the AMLD 5  and, thus, a blind spot. Contrary to other exchanges, it is also 
hard to bring it  into the scope, because of the absence of a middleman. Therefore, if this over time 
would become a succesful platform through which  criminals  operate, it will  be hard to find the r ight 
regulatory answer.  
5.3.5.  Trading platforms  
As a fourth player, we identified trading platforms, which function as a market place bringing 
together different cryptocurrency users that are either looking to buy or sell cryptocurrencies and 
allow them to interact directly. Such trading platforms are so -called “P2P exchanges” or 
“decentralised exchanges” and differ from cryptocurrency exchanges in a numb er of ways, as 
elaborated above. For the purposes of attaching regulation to these trading platforms it is important 
that they are not run by an entity or company that oversees and processes all trades, but they are 
operated exclusively by software (i.e.  there is no central point of authority).  This simply makes it very 
hard  to regulate them and a fortiori  to include them in the list of obliged entities. Again, this is a blind 
spot in the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion, for the same reasons 
as aforementioned with respect to pure cryptocurrency exchanges.

 78 PE 619.024  5.3.6.  Wallet providers  
Next, we identified wallet providers as key players. We made a distinction between three types:  
• hardware wallet providers that provide cryptocurrency us ers with specific hardware solutions to 
privately store their cryptographic keys;  
• software wallet providers that provide cryptocurrency users with software applications allowing 
them to access the network, send and receive cryptocurrencies and locally sav e their 
cryptographic keys; and  
• custodian wallet providers that take (online) custody of a cryptocurrency user’s cryptographic 
keys.  
As aforementioned, only custodian wallet providers, defined as entities that provide services to 
safeguard private cryptog raphic keys on behalf of their customers, to hold, store and transfer virtual 
currencies, are obliged entities under AMLD5. Hardware wallet providers and software wallet 
providers are not custodian wallet providers, as they do not safeguard keys on behalf of their 
customers, but merely provide the tools to customers to safeguard their cryptocurrencies themselves. 
So, again there is a blind spot in the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and tax 
evasion. Users using software or hardware wallets escape AMLD5, as long as they also stay away from 
exchanges exchanging cryptocurrencies into fiat money.   
5.3.7.  Coin inventors  
Sixthly, we identified coin inventors as key players. These were the individuals or organisations who 
have developed the technical  foundations of a cryptocurrency and set the initial rules for its use. 
Often they remain unidentified, making them a hard category to target. On the other hand, it does 
not seem necessary to target them. As coin inventors, they are only the founding fathers of 
cryptocurrency schemes. They only provide the technological tools for others to work with. However, 
if and when they would take- up a different role, the situation might change. Depending on which 
role they take- up concretely they can then fall into o ne of the above categories or the below 
category.  
5.3.8.  Offerors  
That brings us to the last category we identified: the offerors of cryptocurrencies , of course to the 
extent an offeror can be identified; some coins do not have an identifiable offeror. Coin offe rors are 
individuals or organizations that offer coins to cryptocurrency users upon the coin’s initial release, 
either against payment (i.e. through a crowd sale) or at no charge (i.e. in the framework of a specific 
(sign -up) program (e.g. Stellar)). When coins are offered this way, we speak of an initial coin offering in 
the true meaning of the word .407  
Offerors are clearly not obliged entities under AMLD5. Moreover, they will most likely also not be 
caught by financial services laws, because it is difficul t to include cryptocurrencies into the scope of 
these laws .408 So, again, there is a blind spot in the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing 
and tax evasion.  
                                                             
407  The terminology initial coin offering is often used as an umbrella term referring to all kinds of offerings, mostly of tokens. Here, it is used 
in its pure meaning: that of an offering of coins.   
408  See supra footnot e 316. Going forward these offerors could be a useful connecting factor for financial servic es laws, if it would be 
decided  to subject cryptocurrencies to financial services laws.   Cryptocurrencies and blockchain  
 
PE 619.024  79 5.3.9.  The initial question  
Moving over to the initial question: is it enough to include only  virtual currency exchanges and 
custodian wallet providers in the list of obliged entities under AMLD5?  
What is certain is that there are relevant crypto players that are not caught by AMLD5409, sometimes 
because the legislator chose not to (this is true for software wallet providers and pure cryptocurrency 
exchanges  that are not custodian wallet providers ), but, so it seems, sometimes also because he did 
not pay a lot of attention to their existence and the potential risks envolved (this is e.g. true for the 
trading platforms, that, admittedly, escape regulation anyway because there is no one to attach it to; 
for miners, hardware wallet providers  and coin offerors ). This leads to blind spots in the fight against 
money laundering, terrorist financing and ta x evasion .410  
Does it matter?  
Maybe. It all depends on whether these blind spots are actually going to be exploited by criminals. 
Our estimation is that it would not be so surprising if persons with malicious intent would actually 
look up these blind spots in the shadow of AMLD5. If that would happen and it would appear to have 
a (material) adverse effect on the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion, 
there is definitely something to say for expanding the list of obliged entities  with those players that 
were identified the weak spots or have great potential of being weak spots .411 It is therefore 
important to closely follow -up on this and to intervene when required.  
Meanwhile, an interesting thing is to watch is the emergence of self -regulation.412 There have been 
reports of crypto players voluntarily applying customer due diligence to maintain a leading 
commercial edge over others .413 If that would become a more general trend, it could very well 
influence the assessment of whether or n ot a hard law approach, via an amendment of the list of 
obliged entities, is necessary.  
5.4. Does the AMLD5 framework allow to pull enough cryptocu rrency 
users into the light?  
This bring us to the next question in need for an answer: does the AMLD5 framework allow to pull 
enough cryptocurrency users into the light? This question boils down to finding out how anonymous 
their actions can still be on the crypto market after AMLD5.  
First, and as already mentioned before, under AMLD5 users that hold their virtual currencies via a 
custodian wallet provider or enter into virtual curre ncy transactions via a virtual exchange platform 
can no longer be anonymous, because of the customer du e diligence requirements vested upon the 
custodian wallet providers and virtual currency exchange platforms.  
                                                             
409  Also see N. VANDEZANDE , Virtual currencies: a legal framework , Antwerp, Intersentia, 2018,  308.  
410  It is interesting to note that in the legislative process, as elaborated above, the suggestions made by the Committee on Legal Affairs of 
18 January 2017 broadened the scope of the AMLD5, thus further limiting the blind spots. These suggestions were not picked up  later 
on. 
411  A different perspective is that of unfair competition. It has been argued that bringing some virtual currency service providers under the 
scope of the AMLD5, whereas others, who provide similar services, escape, fosters unfair competition: N.  VANDEZANDE , Virtual currencies: 
a legal framework , Antwerp, Intersentia, 2018, 309.

 80 PE 619.024  However, users using hardware or software wallets and for instance trade via a P2P network or via any 
other way than through a virtual currency exc hange platform, can still operate anonymously.414  
For those crypto players deliberately left out of the scope of AMLD5, the legislator is of course aware 
of this risk .415 The solution proposed to address it is that national FIUs should be able to associate 
virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currencies and that the possibility for 
users to self -declare to designated authorities on a voluntary basis should be further assessed. 
Concretely, however, as aforementioned, no immediate a ction is taken. The only achievement is a 
requirement for the Commission to include in its next supranational risk assessment, which is due by 
26 June 2019, if necessary, appropriate proposals, including, where appropriate, with respect to 
virtual currenci es, empowerments to set- up and maintain a central database registering users' 
identities and wallet addresses accessible to FIUs, as well as self -declaration forms for the use of 
virtual currency users. This seems to point in the direction of a system of v oluntary registration, 
instead of mandatory registration (which was also an option brought forward by the Impact 
Assessment), if at all any system will be retained following the next supranational risk assessment. 
Bearing in mind the timing of that assessm ent and that of potential subsequent AMLD amendments 
coming into force, it is clear that nothing is to be expected from Europe very soon.   
This is a very soft approach towards u nveiling  anonymity of users and linking them to 
cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency transactions. First, it is not sure that a system of registration will 
be introduced. Secondly, if ever a system would be put in place, it would be a voluntary one. It can 
very much be doubted if the category that should be targeted the most, users o f cryptocurrencies for 
illicit purposes, would voluntarily register as a user. That would be like trusting the thief to come to 
the police station voluntarily after committing a theft. All in all, the approach taken is therefore not 
very convincing if the legislator is truly serious about u nveiling  anonymity of cryptocurrency users to 
make the combat against money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion more effective. A 
mandatory registration and a pre -set date as of which it applies, is to that en d a much better 
approach, albeit of course more intrusive.    
In this respect we also note that some cryptocurrencies that are now on the market, such as Dash and 
Monero, are fully anonymous, whereas others, such as B itcoin and the like are pseudo -anonymou s, 
basically meaning that if great effort is made and complex techniques are deployed, it is possible for 
authorities to find out users' identities. These fully anonymous cryptocurrencies are designed to stay 
in the dark and outside of the scope of authori ties. After AMLD5 this will no longer be possible to the 
fullest extent: the cryptocurrency users that want to convert their cryptocurrency into fiat currency 
via a virtual currency exchange or hold their portfolio via a custodian wallet provider, will be subject 
to customer due diligence. But, as aforementioned, there is still a whole world outside of these new 
obliged entities under AMLD5. It goes without saying that this may sound particularly interesting for 
criminals seeking for new ways to launder money, finance terrorists or evade taxes. If a legislator does 
not want to outright ban these cryptocurrencies -  and for not imposing such a ban a good argument 
is that cash is also fully anonymous and lawful -  the only way to find out who uses them is to req uire 
users to register mandatorily. For reasons of proportionality it could then be considered to make the 
registration subject to a materiality threshold.

PE 619.024  81 Of course, naivety is not in its place here. The adequacy of a mandatory registration of users, w hether 
or not of fully anonymous or pseudo -anonymous cryptocurrencies, depends on the users' compliance 
with the registration requirement. Such compliance will partly depend on an adequate sanctioning 
toolbox in the event of breach, which is a necessity. B ut how do we detect a breach? Is this at all 
possible outside of the context of randomly bumping into it, at least when fully anonymous 
cryptocurrencies are concerned? This remains a loose end, even in a system of mandatory 
registration, and even when a ba n would be imposed on technology fully anonymising 
cryptocurrencies, which will elaborated below .  
An interesting line of thought here is again self -regulation: crypto intermediaries could decide for 
themselves not to accept fully anonymous cryptocurrencies in the course of their business. That 
could give them a reputational advantage over others, possibly also leading to a commercial 
advantage . If that would become a more general trend, it could have an influence on the assessment 
of whether or not a hard law approach, via registration of users, is necessary. 
5.5. Would it make sense to extend the scope of the Funds Transfer 
Regulation and/or th e Cash Control R egulation as to include 
cryptocurrency transactions?  
Another question is whether it would make sense to  extend the scope of the Funds Transfer 
Regulation and/or the Cash Control R egulation as to include cryptocurrency transactions. 
The answ er relating to the Cash Control Regulation can be short: it doesn’t. Cryptocurrencies are 
normally no t moved physically, making the Cash Control Regulation not such a good instrument to 
target cryptocurrency movements.  
The answer relating to the Funds T ransfer R egulation is more nuanced. This regulation basically aims 
at making sure that all relevant information accompanyi ng fund transfers is there, allowing an 
adequate money laundering and terrorist financing check. It seems conceivable to develop and roll -
out a similar system for cryptocurrency transactions. The entities that would have to fulfil the 
requirements could be  the intermediaries through which the transactions run. Going forward, this 
could be a valuable add -on to the existing framework.  
5.6. Is there a need for a more comprehensive approach, introducing 
license requirements for cryptocurrencies?  
A difficult question is whether a more intrusive approach towards regulating the crypto market is 
warranted. As we have seen throughout this research, the EBA is a strong advocate of developing a 
tailored and more comprehensive framework for cryptocurrenci es in time, including license 
requirements for cryptocurrency service providers. Part of such framework would be to create a 
virtual currency scheme governance authority that is accountable to the regulator.416 An interesting 
line of thought for future regul ation could indeed be to create or impose a “middleman”, where the 
use of blockchain or other distributed ledger technology has cut out such middleman, as this will 
allow the regulator to attach regulation to an identifiable person, thus contributing to enhanced 
compliance and effective enforcement.  
                                                             
416  See 4.2.4  The coming of age of the inclusion of cryptocurrencies into AMLD5 .  IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies  
 
 82 PE 619.024  Examples of tailored regimes for inspirational purposes can also be found abroad, e.g. the New York 
State Virtual Currency Business Activity license417 or the proposed  Maltese Virtual Currency Act  and 
Framework f or the Certification of Distributed Ledger Technology Platform s and Related Service 
Providers418.  
The IMF also invited regulators to consider a more comprehensive approach.419  
A similar call can be found in very recent PhD research.420 Along the same lines, so me legal doctrine 
suggested to revise the e -money framework and include cryptocurrencies into that revised 
framework .421 Other legal doctrine, however, is more reluctant and advocates that a hard -touch 
regulatory approach can hinder the potential welfare- enhancing innovations coming from the 
ecosystem of cryptocurrencies422. In line herewith, it was raised that the benefits of regulation should 
be weighed with the costs associated therewith, and the potential deterrent effect on emerging 
businesses.423  
A more co mprehensive approach would include in any event the anti -money laundering and counter 
terrorist financing framework, because it would refer to AMLD5. Because of that, for the purposes of 
this research, the question is very interesting, but out of scope. Therefore, we will not elaborate it 
further.  
5.7. Is it not best to introduce an outright ban for some aspects linked to 
some cryptocurrencies?  
The question arises whether some aspects relating to some cryptocurrencies should not just be 
banned and crim inally sanctioned. To mind come  the mixing process attached to Dash's feature 
PrivateSend  and Monero's RingCT, stealth addresses and Kovri -project . In essence, these features  are 
designed to make cryptocurrency users untraceable. But why is such degree of anonymity truly 
necessary? Would allowing this not veer too far towards criminals? Imposing a ban for such aspects 
surrounding cryptocurrencies that are aimed at making it impossible to verify their users and 
criminally sanction ing these aspects seems to be in line with the Council's conclusions of April 2018 
                                                             
417  The regulatory framework can be accessed via:  https://www.dfs.ny.gov/legal/regulations/adoptions/dfsp200t. pdf. A concise analysis 
can be found in P. VALCKE , N. VANDEZANDE  and N. VAN DE VELDE , "The evolution of third party payment providers and cryptocurrencies 
under the EU's upcoming PSD2 and AMLD4", 2015, Swift Institute Working Paper No. 2015 -001, 64 -65. 
418  Malta positions itself as a leader in distributed ledger technology regulation. In February 2018 the Parliamentary Secretary for Financial 
Services, Digital Economy and Innovation within the Office of the Prime Minister, issued a consultation document on the establishment 
of a Malta Digital Innovation Authority, a Framework for the Certification of Distributed Ledger Technology Platforms and Rel ated 
Service Providers, and a Virtual Currency Act. The consultation was recently closed on 9 March 2018, but the results have yet to be made 
public. It will be interesting to follow -up on this and assess the future framework for potential inspiration of future EU legislation. See:

PE 619.024  83 on how to respond to malicious cyber activities, under which that the use of ICT for malicious 
purposes is unacceptable .424 
Whatever the answer may be, we must again avoid bei ng naive: even if a ban would be imposed, how 
do we detect a breach, given that the purpose of the object of the ban just is to obscure identities?425 
Nevertheless, it would be  worthwhile to consider introduc ing a ban. If authorities then bump into the 
prohi bited activities, they have a legal basis for prosecution, insofar not yet available. Possibly, 
imposing a ban could also have a deterrent effect. Of course, again there is the tension with data 
protection, but arguably in the balance of things the interes t of authorities and society to more 
effectively combat money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion via well -defined specific 
bans outweighs the interest of persons desiring to hide their identities completely.  
In any event, imposing a ban shoul d always be focused on specific aspects facilitating the illicit use of 
cryptocurrency too much. We are not in favour of general bans on cryptocurrencies or barring the 
interaction between cryptocurrency business and the formal financial sector as a whole,  such as is the 
case in China for example .426 That would go too far in our opinion. As long as good safeguards are in 
place protecting the formal financial sector and more in general society as a whole, such as rules 
combating money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion and maybe a more comprehensive set 
of rules aim ing at protecting legitimate users (such as ordinary consumers and investors), that should 
be sufficient.  
5.8. Is the European level the appropriate one to tackle money 
laundering, terrorist fi nancing and tax evasion via cryptocurrency 
transactions?  
Cryptocurrency transactions and crypto players are not bound by borders. Therefore, it is certain that 
the national level is not the right level to address money laundering, terrorist financing and t ax 
evasion via cryptocurrencies. The European level is more appropriate. Even more appropriate, 
however, is the international level, as crypto activity is also not limited by the European border. 
Therefore, international collaboration, e.g. in the context of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the 
FATF and the Egmont Group, is crucial to successfully impose and enforce rules on combating money 
laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion.427  
From a regulatory perspective, a G20 initiative on a global framew ork for regulating and overseeing 
cryptocurrencies, to the extent necessary, would be welcome.428 As it stands now, a first step toward a 
unified regulation of cryptocurrencies is expected to be taken at this level429 in July 2018.430 It will be 
                                                             
424 See: http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press -releases/2018/04/16/malicious -cyber -activities -council -adopts -conclusions/ .    
425  With respect to Dash's PrivateSend,  a line of thought here could be to assess to what extent the masternodes could be targeted. If that 
would be possible, sanctioning would arguably be easier: if you shut the masternodes down who facilitate the mixi ng process, the 
process in itself may not be available any longer.

https ://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1603.pdf , 28 and 35.

 WHAT ABOUT BLOCKCHAI N? 
The reader will have noticed that our overview and assessment of the regulatory framework almost 
entirely relates to cryptocurrencies. This has been done deliberately so.  
As aforementioned and evidenced throughout this research, blockchain is technology on which a 
cryptocurrency can run. The scope of blockchain is, however, much wider than that of 
cryptocurrencies. It can be applied in a large variety of sectors (e.g. trade and commerce, healthcare, 
governance, …), has numerous po tential promising applications, e.g. relating to pledging of 
collateral, the registration of shares, bonds and other assets431, the operation of land registers, etc.  
Therefore, it would be too blunt to associate blockchain with money laundering, terrorist f inancing or 
tax evasion. It is just technology, which is not designed to launder money, facilitate terrorist financing 
or evade taxes, and has numerous applications throughout the whole lawful economy. It would not 
be wise to discourage future innovations in this respect by submitting blockchain and fintechs 
exploring its use cases to burdensome requirements, simply because of one of the applications using 
blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, is used illicitly by some432. Admittedly, cryptocurrencies are 
the first well known application putting blockchain technology into the spotlight, but nowadays 
blockchain has clearly outgrown the context of cryptocurrencies.  
Therefore, we suggest to leave blockchain be from a money laundering, terrorist financing and tax 
evasion perspective and focus on the illicit use cases of cryptocurrencies.

  More and more regulators are worrying about criminals who are increasingly using 
cryptocurrencies for illegitimate activities like money laundering, terrorist financing  and tax 
evasion. The problem is significant: even though the full scale of misuse of virtual currencies is 
unknown, its market val ue has been reported to exceed EUR 7 billion worldwide. This paper 
prepared by Policy Department A elaborates on this phenomenon from a legal perspective, 
focusing on the use of cryptocurrencies for financial crime, money laundering and tax evasion. It 
contains policy recommendations for future EU standards.

summary
The shortcomings of existing financial systems became 
widely criticised in the aftermath of the 2007–08 financial crisis leading to an unprecedented wave of interest in new ways of efficiently executing economic transactions while ensuring high levels of transparency and accountability. With over 2,000 in existence at the time of writing this report, cryptocurrencies have received a great deal of attention as a potential tool for radically altering financial landscapes for the betterment of society. The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive overview of how crypto-currencies could be used to achieve this purpose. This includes how cryptocurrencies currently function relative to the intentions of their pioneers, and how the general public, use, understand, and trust them.
Some of the main findings include:
  Modern discussions and debates about crypto-
currencies tend to confuse ‘money’ with ‘systems of payments’ or, the mechanism by which transactions are processed and settled.
  Cryptocurrencies have the potential to vastly improve systems of payments if designed and implemented correctly. 
  In practice, existing cryptocurrencies have failed to achive the objectives envisioned by their pioneers and would generally not be considered as money.
  New innovations (stablecoins, proof of stake, CBDCs) are helping to make digital currencies more realistic candidates to replace traditional money and create benefis for users across large volumes of transactions.In addition to these technical challenges, the value added in this report comes from a unique empirical examination of how citizens undertand cryptocurrencies and trust in different institutions to issue and manage money across a unique sample of eight countries including Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, Spain, the UK and the US.
Some of the main findings include:
  Knowledge, use, and understanding, of crypto-
currencies remains highly limited in all countries.
  The vast majority of citizens in all countries agree that money should continue to be issued by central banks.
  While all central banks enjoy a significant trust premium when it comes to the creation and management of money, large differences exists between Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico) and European countries (France, Germany, Spain, UK) and the US.
  Countries where central banks experience lower trust premiums are more open to adopting new digital currencies issued by alternative institutions
  Trust in Facebook to issue and manage a currency remains very limited, especially in Europe and the US.
  The degree of acceptability and price stability play a key role in determining preferences for holding of money, regardless of who is issuing it. 4
Since their inception in 2008 and the subsequent en -
thusiasm, media attention, delusion, reflection, and 
continuous innovation, ‘cryptocurrencies’ have be -
come one of the most interesting and perhaps most misunderstood phenomena of the early 21
st century. 
Their popularity and potential for ‘disrupting’ and improving traditional financial systems, however, have led to an expanding list of media commentaries, re -
search papers, and policy reports.  Unfortunately, many of these contributions have tended to focus on the contemporary positivist side of cryptocurrency without considering the normative intentions of its creators or, perhaps more importantly, the historical context under which money and monetary systems have evolved. These contributions have also tended to focus on dig -
ital money from a single disciplinary viewpoint (com -
puter science, economics, finance) without a great deal of consideration or integration of the valuable inputs from other perspectives. The idea of money has evolved continously over time. In the context of the technological innovations of the 21
st century, it has become a phenomenon with a wid-
er range of feasible possibilities, some of which were in fact proposed as far back as the early 20
th century. 
To give some idea of the new range of types of money, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) published a series of taxonomies including the ‘money flower’ and more general taxonomies that distinguish between central bank-issued currencies (which are a liability on the central bank balance sheet) and private-sector issued digital currencies (which are not the liability of anyone). Within this wider context, there exists a va -
riety of types of money, each of which has different underlying characteristics, or attributes. Introduction/

For example, a physical cash transaction is issued and 
is backed by (a liability of) the central bank and is sub -
ject to some degree of inflation over time, has low transaction costs and is accepted by all sellers of goods and services. On the other hand, a credit card transac -
tion is backed by (a liability of) a commercial bank, is subject to the same degree of depreciation as cash, may come with some (explicit or implicit) transaction costs, and is accepted by all sellers of goods and services. 
Given some of the shortcomings of money and existing 
financial systems that became apparent in the after -
math of the 2007-08 financial crisis, Nakamoto (2008) proposed a new type of money which would effectively remove many of the third-party participants in trans -
actions, making a more efficient, and less costly, way to make transactions with strangers. With over 2,000 cryptocurrencies in existence at the time of writing this report, cryptocurrencies have since become progres -
sively embraced by speculative investors and growing market caps, but have yet to be adopted by the wider public as a viable form of money due to practical tech -
nical challenges along with a lack of trust in the issuing authorities and understanding of how to use them.    Some of the more fundamental questions that deserve closer attention within ‘monetary ecosystems’  revolve around who creates the money and what is their rela -
tionship with the entity who creates and obtains value from it. This is especially important in a fiat currency environment where the value of money (digital or phys -
ical) depends on the degree of trust users have in those who issued or back the currency. The purpose of this report is to provide a more comprehensive overview of 
how cryptocurrencies could be used for the betterment 
of society, how they currently function and how the general public uses, understands and trusts cryptocur -
rencies across a sample of eight countries. 
The first chapter of this report will examine the nor -
mative nature of money including the role of commu -
nity trust and the role that government plays in ensur -
ing this trust. In this normative framework, we can 
think about the possibility of cryptocurrency as money and how this might be possible. A key part of this in -
troductory chapter is the idea of trust and money, es -
pecially in the fiat currency system that has emerged in the late 20
th century. The second chapter will provide a brief history of money over the 20
th century, including the gold stan -
dard era, the design of Bretton Woods and the adop -
tion of fiat currencies. This chapter will also touch on some of the historical themes that have re-emerged in the context of cryptocurrencies, including Hayek’s idea relating to currency competition and some of the challenges involved with fractional reserve banking systems. 
Moving into the 21
st century, Chapter 3 will consider 
the possibility of realistic possibility that ‘money’ will 
dramatically change in the coming years with the evolution of cryptocurrencies. This chapter will con -
sider some of the arguments against the use of phys -
ical and untraceable cash including fraud and health concerns. More generally, this chapter will consider the social benefits of moving towards digital curren -
cies and the associated risks/barriers.   
Chapter 4 will provide an overview of how cryptocur -
rencies work in terms of their degree of centralization, 
security and anonymity, token supply and governance (consensus protocols). This chapter will examine cryp -
tocurrencies in terms of what they were meant to be from the perspective of Nakamoto (2008) and what they have become in practice. This chapter will large -
ly draw on the case of Bitcoin, but will also discuss briefly new generation tokens (stablecoins, Libra).
Chapter 5 will consider the arguments for the issuance 
of Central Bank Digital Currencies, including a review of the literature and survey of what Central Banks are currently doing in terms of the adoption of a central 
bank-backed cryptocurrency. This chapter will also 
discuss the implications for monetary policy and fi -
nancial stability from adopting this new type of dig -
ital money. 
Lastly, Chapter 6 will discuss the results of the new 
IE Survey on ‘Cryptocurrencies and The Future of Money’ in the context of Chapters 1--5. From a diverse sample of countries (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, France, Germany, Spain, UK, USA). The results show that residents tend to place a trust premium on central banks-backed money. However, significant differenc -
es appear across countries, especially those in Latin America.7
Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
the  nature  
oF Money  
and  the  
possibility  
oF	Crypto-
currency  as 
Money  
By	professor	t ony	Lawson,
University	of	Cambridgechapter18
A form of money, just like any other social phenomenon, is 
a property of a particular community, and so typically pos -
sessing various community-specific features. Many com -
munities have produced money, however, and the concern here is with commonalities of all the numerous forms.
In this regard, the most obvious common or shared 
feature is that by which a money can everywhere be identified or recognised. This is its property of being employed as a general means of payment, of being useable to discharge any debt in the community in which the money is produced. 
If, say, in any specific money community, an individual 
participant requests of a seller, a loaf of bread, or per -
haps a meal, then, when the bread is handed over, or after the meal has been consumed, the buyer is in debt to the seller.  It is an identifying property of money that, in all such transactions (excepting in cases where a specific alternative agreement on means of payment has been reached in advance of a debt being occurred), the money can be used to settle the resulting debt.
A basic condition for a general means of payment to 
exist in any community is that the latter has a system of value accounting that includes, as a component, a (community-specific) unit of value. This is simply a unit of value measurement or assignment -- such as pound sterling, US dollar, euro -- in terms of which all goods, services, or assets in a community will have their as -
sessed values expressed. Clearly all items of money must also be denominated in the same units as the debts, if the money is to be used to cancel them. So, money will itself be a feature of a system of value ac -
counting that includes a unit of value (or account) as an additional accepted component.
If the nominal property of any money, i.e. that by which 
it is identified, lies in its being accepted as a general means of payment, a further more fundamental feature that grounds this property is the manner of the mon -
ey’s incorporation as a component of the community’s system of value accounting. Most social phenomena (not just money) are in fact constituted through pro -
cesses whereby certain kinds of things are incorporat -
ed into community systems as components. In all cases, the phenomena are created by processes of social positioning, whereby selected kinds of things are al -
located to positions, thereby constituting them as different types of phenomena qua system components, and whereupon their uses, qua positioned items or system components, are governed by community-ac -
cepted sets of rights and obligations. To see this, it is enough to think of the creation and acceptable uses of means of transport, motorways, car parks, traffic lights, passports, schools and hospitals, etc.

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
creation of money involves the 
community acceptance of a money position within the community’s value accounting system and the allocation of a certain kind of thing (currently, it is typically bank debt – see below) to the mon -
ey position, producing money as a system component. As part of this positioning process, rights and obligations are allocated to com -
munity members, determining that holders of instances of the  money have the right to use it to cancel their debts and correspond -
ing creditors typically have a matched obligation to accept the money, if it is offered. 
The ability of money to serve as a 
general means of payment is, then, grounded in its additional proper -
ty of being positioned (in the com -
munity’s system of value account -
ing) in such a manner that its uses are governed by the noted rights and obligations. As with all social phenomena, the existence of money is seen, final -
ly, to depend on community ac -
ceptance. However, the notion of acceptance that is key here should be interpreted not as involving any necessary agreement or con -
tentedness of community partic -
ipants with the situation, only as a willingness to go along with it, at least for the time being.  Typi -
cally, this general acceptance, in the case of money, takes the form of a preparedness to go along with the declarations of designated bodies to whom authority has been delegated.  In modern soci -
eties this delegated authority takes the form of the government or central bank.
10
To this point the concern has been on the nature and 
constitution of money per se.  However, the focus of primary interest here is on more than money per se and specifically on a money that functions successfully . An 
additional nominal property for a successful money is 
that (as well as being a general means of payment) it has generalised purchasing power. 
The manner in which money is constituted as a com -
ponent of a community’s system of value accounting 
ensures, as we have seen, that a participant who holds money has the right to use it to discharge any debts already held. However, there is no agreement entailed that participants must become creditors in the first place, that they must allow others to run up debts with them that can be discharged using the money.  In coun -
tries with hyperinflation, is not unusual to see signs displayed saying goods or services can be acquired only if there is an advance agreement (i.e. prior to a debt being created) for payment to be made in a foreign currency.  Thus, a restaurateur, say, will allow custom -
ers to order a meal and so acquire a debt if they in effect take out a contact in advance to pay by something other than the local currency.
So, a successful money is in place where participants 
can easily use it to make purchases, meaning that sell -
ers, etc., are ready to become creditors in the knowledge that the money will be used to discharge the debts that so arise.  For this to be the situation, community par -
ticipants must trust in the money. Trust is key to the successful functioning of any money.
2 Specifically, 
community participants must trust that if they hold items of money, others will be willing to take such money from them, a condition of which being that no one expects items of money to lose value in the mean -
time. In short, to function successfully, a money must be trusted as a stable store of liquidity, a store of liquid (i.e. easily transferable) value.  
The dominant worry of recent monetary history is that 
money will lose value, as is markedly the case in epi -
sodes of countries experiencing hyperinflation. But an additional concern that can arise, one that will be seen to be especially relevant when considering the possi -
bilities for cryptocurrencies, is that the money instead appreciates in value.  In the face of an anticipated de -
cline in its value, participants will not want to hold money; however, in the face of an expected appreciation in its value, participants will not want to let go of it.  Either development undermines the usefulness of mon -
ey for performing its canonical functions.B.	purchasing	p ower	and

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
What, then, are the capacities or capacity required of a 
successfully functioning money?  It is precisely an abil -
ity to instil trust in community participants that the money so formed through its positioning will be a sta -
ble form of liquid value. This will be most easily achieved where prior to positioning, the money has been found to be a store of value that is easy to pass on.   
Currently  the money position, was indeed already re -
garded as a store of value, and became so positioned 
precisely to instil a trust in the money so hold. This is bank  debt. 
Here the term debt  is understood to be an obligation 
held by a debtor to satisfy a creditor. It is internally related to a credit , where the latter, technically and 
legally speaking, means a specific right to payment or satisfaction.  Credit and debt, in other words, are two aspects of the same social relation - a credit/debt (or debt/credit) relation - connecting a creditor and a debt -
or; you cannot have one aspect without the other.  Credit is simply this relation viewed from the perspec -
tive of the creditor; it is debt from the point of view of the debtor. In fact, in classical accounting terms, this credit/debt relationship was seen as an exchange of credere  (‘to trust’) for debere  (‘to owe’),
3 which conclud -
ed in the exchange of real underlying assets. Simply put, two entities bind themselves, at a specific point in time, to remain bound to, and trust each other, over the course of the agreement.
How does bank debt/credit (positioned) as money work? 
Two forms of bank debt are involved, commercial and central bank debt. If, for example, a commercial bank makes a loan to a customer, it records the amount of that loan in the customer’s account. The entry shown (or resulting increase in any entry) marks an amount of money thereby acquired by the customer. In the case of the loan, this money is created on the spot.  It is done so through the formation of a debt of the bank to the c. Money as p ositioned 
bank d ebt

customer. But the result is automat -
ically an amount of money. For, 
since bank debt was at the relevant point in history first positioned as money, all new items of bank debt come into the world already posi -
tioned as money. That is, just as a child of members of the UK Royal Family arrives in the world already positioned as royal, or indeed a child born in the UK of two UK cit -
izens arrives in the world already positioned as a UK citizen, so, cur -
rently, all instances of bank debt arrive in the world already posi -
tioned as money.
Of course, not all money held in an 
individual’s deposit account was created by loans. But all the money there recorded takes the form of commercial bank debt positioned as money. 
The ability to create new debt/cred -
it as money generally lies in the 
power of commercial banks and the central bank. The central bank can create money by extending loans to commercial banks in the form of the latter’s reserves. Many indeed refer to the two cases as producing com-
mercial bank mone y and central bank 
money  respectively, the two togeth -
er being bank money.
4  
So, the occupant of the money posi -
tion currently relied upon to instil trust in a money formed out of it is bank debt (a kind of thing that to serve its intended role usually also requires a degree of continuous state backing, an orientation that can in -
volve, but does not reduce to a reli -
ance upon, laws of legal tender).  
Finally, as is the current situation 
with bank debt, the item posi -tioned as money is not observable, a necessary additional feature of a community’s system of value ac -
counting is a set of markers or identifiers of money, or of those that hold it.  In the case of com -
mercial bank money, its markers are electronic entries in the com -
munity participant’s bank account.  In the case of central bank money, the markers may take the form of, first, cash, in particular where the money is held by the public, and, second, electronic markers, indi -
cating money held as deposits at the central bank, including com -
mercial bank reserves. So strictly speaking, neither electronic re -
cords nor cash are money but rath -
er are markers of it.    
To summarise, a community’s money 
possesses generalised debt-discharg -
ing power and, when it functions successfully, generalised purchasing power. The first of these powers is grounded in money’s property of be -
ing positioned as component of a community’s system of value ac -
counting in a manner such that its uses are governed by a specific set of community-accepted rights and ob -
ligations, in particular that debtors have a right to discharge their debts using the money and the correspond -
ing creditors have an obligation to accept the money when offered.  The second of these powers, i.e., gener -
alised purchasing power, is grounded in a community’s trust in it as a stable form of liquid value, a trust that, typ -
ically at least, is grounded in turn in the trust-instilling capacity of money backed up by the support of the state-backed banking system.

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
D.	the	possibility	of	Forms 	
of	Cryptocurrency	as	Money
It follows that there are two basic properties that must 
be possessed by a form of cryptocurrency that is to function successfully as a community’s money.  First it must be accepted throughout the community as being a component of its system of value accounting and its use is governed by rights and obligations that serve to render it a general means of payment. Second, the mon -
ey so formed must be trusted as a stable store of liquid value, grounding the property of it being a general form of purchasing power. The basic question to pursue, then, is whether systems based on forms of cryptocur -
rency can be devised wherein these two basic conditions are met. 
If the latter are identified as the essential features of a 
successfully functioning money, the forgoing outline does also point to additional factors to consider. For example, all cases of money have been seen to take the form of a component of a community’s system of value accounting closely related to other components of the same system. This being so, it may be the case that, in order to replace one form of community money with another, it is necessary to replace or transform other internally related components of the system of value accounting. For example, had the UK joined the Euro-pean Monetary System, then not only would a different form of central bank debt have been involved, but the markers of money referred to as cash would have changed, as indeed would the unit of account (from pounds sterling to euros).
Forms of cryptocurrency do indeed come as (sub) 
systems in themselves. To consider the most famil -
iar case, that of Bitcoin, it seems this label is indeed best used for a whole subsystem rather than any one component. In actual practice the term Bitcoin tends to be used variously: for the proposed system as a whole, a revised unit of account, and both a money position and its occupant (to the extent that they are distinguished).
An additional matter to consider is the nature of the 
community for which the money is intended. For, with all social phenomena being found to be community-rel -
ative, the possibilities of a form of cryptocurrency being accepted as money will depend on the specific community that is being considered. The central focus here is a national community like the UK. But it may be that forms of cryptocurrency can serve, and perhaps have already served, as money in some relatively small communities, especially illegal ones concerned with activities like the buying and selling of illicit goods online.   
At present, general acceptance in modern national or 
international communities requires authorisation by central authorities. Fundamental to the monetary workings of such communities at present are banking systems that issue, seek to control/regulate, and en -
deavour to maintain a stable value of, money.  Prima facie, developments like Bitcoin not only do not make any appeal to regulators and bankers, but the very reason for their design is to bypass them, to leave these institutional factors out of the value accounting system entirely. At the heart of it all is a desire to create a peer-to-peer electronic system of buying and selling that does not require the necessary mediation or in -
tervention of any financial institution or other agency.  As Nakamoto (2008) indicates in the opening sentence of the paper introducing bitcoin:14
“A	purely	peer-to-peer	version	of 	
electronic	cash	would	allow	online 	
payments	to	be	sent	directly	from 	
one	party	to	another	without	going 	
through	a	financial	institution
– Nakamoto, 2008, p.1”15
Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
To gain general acceptance, then, any such proposed 
cryptocurrency system must prove to be either 1) so widely popular or backed by organisations so powerful (as is presumably the intention, for example of Face -
book’s Libra, with the proposed launching of its own global cryptocurrency backed by significant assets) that the state or states involved is/are unable to resist it; or 2) adapted/oriented so as to work through existing fi -
nancial and government institutions, in which case its use would not be, as originally intended, to displace existing institutions and processes but to facilitate the working of the existing systems in some way.   
More can be said too on the task of achieving trust. As 
noted, an essential challenge is to achieve a situation wherein a form of cryptocurrency is trusted as a stable store of liquidity.  This is the central form of trust to be achieved.  However, other forms are essential too, al -
beit in ways, or for reasons, that depend on the partic -
ulars of the money form. 
Certainly, all forms of money are open to abuse. Money 
in the form of a positioned valuable commodity was subject to clipping (the practice of cutting small pieces from, especially, gold or silver coins, with cut-off piec -
es often used to make counterfeit coins; this being a practice thought to be so undermining of the money process of Britain in the seventeenth century that clip -
ping was deemed a matter of high treason, punishable by death). And, there are continuous (more or less suc -
cessful) attempts to produce counterfeit versions of modern cash. Further, with the rise of electronic records of money, there are attempts to defraud through the duplication of these records. Without institutional in -
tervention to prevent this under the current system, it would be possible for one and the same electronic record of money to be used to ground two or more expenditures (the so-called double spending problem). Cryptocur -
rencies involve peer-to-peer verified blockchain tech -
nologies designed just to avoid this sort of fraud. Com -
munity participants must trust that such efforts are usually successful.
But these context-specific and contingent technical 
issues of trust generation aside, most significant of all is whatever the form of money developed, there must be a trust that the money so formed would prove to be a stable form of liquid value. In the case of a form of cryptocurrency, with no pre-existing record of attained trust (prior to its being positioned as money, were this to happen), and with potentially the displacement of all (state or bank) administrators who under the current system help stabilise a money’s value through regulat -
ing actual transactions, the task of attaining the req -
uisite sort and levels of trust would not be straightfor -
ward. Specifically, the task of creating a form of cryptocurrency that could be, and prior to positioning would be expected to be, a stable form of liquid value is a significant challenge. 
One final matter that might be raised here is the ques -
tion of whether more than one form, and if so, how 
many forms, of cryptocurrency could simultaneously be constituted as money. For, if one form managed to overcome all the obstacles including acceptance by the state (and so for example accepted by the state as a means of discharging tax debts) then presumably many forms could do so.16
Money is commonly identified as that component of a 
community’s system of value accounting that is accept -
ed throughout the community to serve as a general means of payment and, when functioning successfully, as a general form of purchasing power. Its property of being a general means of payment is grounded in the money being accepted as a component of the system, governed by a specific set of rights and obligations that work precisely to ensures that it serves this function. Typically, this allocates to debtors the right to have their debts settled by handing over money (of the ap -
propriate value) and to creditors the obligation to accept it.  Money’s property of possessing generalised pur -
chasing power is grounded in the community’s trust in it as a stable form of liquid value. Such trust, in part, has typically been achieved by positioning money a specific kind of thing that has the capacity to instil this trust. How this works in practice is contingent and varies over time.The challenge, then, for those seeking to render form(s) of cryptocurrency as money lies both in getting it po -
sitioned as a legitimate general means of payment (governed by relevant rights and obligations ensuring this) and so also trusted in the sense that if positioned as money it can serve as a store of liquid value.e. conclusion17

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
Money in the 20th century can broadly be divided into 
three parts: 1900–1933 when the international gold 
standard ensured that money was backed by the pos -
session of physical gold, 1934-1971 when the dollar devaluation and the Bretton Woods System emerged, and 1972-1999 when fiat money was introduced and adopted (Mundell, 2000).
tHe	GoLD	StANDArD	erA	(1900–1933)

Under the gold standard, money is backed by the value 
of physical gold held by a country. Because a given amount of paper money can be converted into a fixed amount of an underlying physical asset, in this case gold, countries on the gold standard are prevented from increasing the supply of paper money in circulation without also increasing their holdings of gold reserves. This system was effective in preventing any irrespon -
sible governments from taking advantage of their mo -
nopoly on money by printing too much of it. This al -
lowed holders of that money to feel that the value of their paper money was ‘insured’, or ‘collateralized’ by the underlying gold that backed it.
While the gold standard was generally regarded as an 
essential source of economic trust and prosperity in the late 19
th and early 20th century, deflation and depression 
in the 1930s revealed some of the defects of the inflex -
ibilities in the gold standard. To understand why the gold standard was abandoned, it is important to under -
stand the deflationary bias of the gold standard, which triggered deflation and depression in the 1930s. During the gold standard era, gold flowed across different coun -
tries. As a result, some countries possessed more gold than necessary for conversion against its total money supply, in accordance to the fixed conversion ratio (the gold-surplus countries), while others possessed less than required (the gold-deficit countries). Economic historian Peter Temin pointed out an asymmetry be -
tween gold-surplus and gold-deficit countries in their monetary response to gold flows (Temin, 1989). 
Since gold-deficit countries had more money supply 
than could be supported by their gold reserve, they were forced to reduce their money supply and deflate; failing to do so could trigger people to worry about the con -
vertibility of their domestic currency, scramble for gold, and would eventually lead to a complete loss of gold reserves in the country. Hence, gold-deficit countries faced plenty of incentive to deflate their currency to prevent devaluation. On the other hand, gold-surplus countries had insufficient money supply for conversion against their gold reserve. To prevent undervaluation of their domestic currency given the fixed conversion ratio, they were supposed to expand their money supply and inflate. The asymmetry was that no sanctions pre -
vented gold-surplus countries from sterilizing gold inflows and accumulating gold reserves indefinitely.  
Such asymmetric dynamics led to a deflationary bias 
in the gold standard. The bias was not obvious during the pre-war periods, since the gold standard was cen -
tred around the operations of Bank of England, which as a profit-making institution strived to avoid gold accumulation as opposed to interest-paying assets. However, WWI led to the decline of British economy. Meanwhile, as economic historian Barry Eichengreen showed, the two major gold-surplus countries of the interwar periods, the United States and France, did a. the Gold s tandard and the 
Adoption	of	Fiat	Money 	20
little to avoid gold accumulation (Eichengreen, 1986). 
As a result, the deflationary bias of gold standard began to manifest itself by the end of 1920s.

There exists a great deal of literature focusing on the 
gold standard as a mechanism that “turned an ordinary business downturn into the Great Depression.” (Eichen -
green and Temin, 1997, p.1) argue that “the most im -
portant barrier to actions that would have arrested or reversed the decline was the mentality of the gold standard” which “sharply restricted the range of ac -
tions they were willing to contemplate.” The result of this cultural condition was “to transform a run-of-the-mill economic contraction into a Great Depression that changed the course of history” (Eichengreen and Te -
min, 2000, p.183). This was largely due to a reliance on the tested usefulness of past money and risk aver -
sion when it came to new methods of creating and managing money.  Former chair of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke and economic historian Harold James proposed a financial mechanism in which deflation can trigger economic recession. For example, bank liabilities such as deposits are fixed in nominal terms, whereas bank assets such as debt instruments are fixed in real terms. In this case, deflation reduces the value of bank assets dispropor -
tionally and heightens pressure on the bank capital. In response, banks call in loans or refuse new ones, in turn worsening the positions of borrowers. But borrowers such as firms may lay off workers or curtail investments to improve their financial positions, contributing to an economic recession.
5 Unfortunately, the United States 
and other countries on the gold standard could not ex -
pand their money supplies to stimulate the economy. Such unbearable inflexibility led Great Britain to drop the gold standard in 1931, influencing many countries to follow shortly thereafter.

Influenced by economist and presidential advisor George 
Warren, the United States adopted a flexible exchange rate in 1933 for one year and devalued the dollar. It was expected that the lower exchange rate would boost the competitiveness of US products in the world economy, assisting economic recovery. The rise of the price of gold was also expected to raise the import price and thus the domestic price level, as a measure to counter the defla -
tion problem. As a result, the wholesale price level in the United States did increase by almost 30 percent between 1933 and 1937. With the official price of gold raised by 69% to $35 an ounce, the United States restored pegging its currency to gold in April 1934. 
In 1936, the United States, Britain, and France signed 
the Tripartite Accord establishing new rules for ex -
change rate management. These new arrangements were eventually ratified at Bretton Woods in 1944. The monetary system become a gold-dollar standard where -

tuting for scarce gold as an international unit of account, 
medium of exchange, and store of value.  
For the system to operate smoothly it was crucial that 
the United States maintain stable monetary and fiscal policy, which occurred until the 1960s. Based on Keynes -
ian philosophy, the Kennedy and Johnson administrations prioritized increasing US growth and reducing unem -
ployment below 4% using aggregate demand manage -
ment policies by expanding the fiscal deficits. Meanwhile, the chairman of Federal Reserve William Martin, in the 1950s and 1960s prioritized cooperation with government administration over central bank independence. In re -
sponse to the Kennedy tax cut, and the build-up of gov -
ernment expenditure for the Vietnam War and the John -
son’s Great Society programs, the Federal Reserve deployed expansionary monetary policy to accommodate one half of the increase in the fiscal deficit. This led to the steady increase in US inflation rate in the 1960s.
Martin pursued a contractionary monetary policy right 
before he left the Federal Reserve, which contributed to a recession during the Nixon administration in 1970 and soaring unemployment. Economic historian Mi -
chael Bordo argued that Nixon’s perception of why he lost the 1960 election to John Kennedy had triggered his paranoia about the political consequences of rising unemployment. This in turn led Nixon to apply im -
mense political pressure onto the new Chairman of Federal Reserve Arthur Burns to reverse Martin’s pol -
icies and expand money growth in 1971 (Bordo, 2018). The rekindled US inflation contributed to the under -
valuation of gold. Under the significant balance of payment deficit of the United States since WWII, Nixon feared that the British would convert their dollar hold -
ings into gold and threaten the US gold reserve. As a result, Nixon announced his New Economic Policy on 15 August 1971, closing the US gold window and effec -
tively declaring the death of the Bretton Woods System.

Fiat money is a medium of exchange that is neither a 
commercial commodity nor title to any such commod -
ity. It is “not convertible by law into anything other than itself and has no fixed value in terms of an objec -
tive standard” (Keynes, 1930). The value of fiat money is derived from a premium based on a collective trust in the continued existence and stability of the entity issuing it. In simple terms, the difference between the cost of producing money and its value to people who own it is the trust they place in it.
The fiat money era solved many of the problems of the 
gold standard era by allowing policymakers greater levels of flexibility to adapt to economic circumstances and/or influence the economic decision making of households and corporations. The adoption of fiat cur -
rencies effectively expanded the central banker’s tool -
box to allow adjustment of the supply of money through interest rates and capital reserve requirements.   
Nevertheless, the fiat money era also opened opportunities 
for abuse by irresponsible policymakers – under the gold standard, policymakers were forced to demonstrate own -
ership of an underlying asset (gold) that could act as collat -
eral against the paper money they printed. Fiat money, however, is uncollateralized and thus is only as valuable as people believe it to be. This potential for abuse was recent -

Episodes of extreme inflation caused by irresponsible policymakers are dotted throughout history, often causing long-last -
ing economic hardships on a country’s population, due to the irresponsible printing of new money (often to finance gov -
ernment debt). A few well-documented cases are shown below (Zimbabwe) and to the right (Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela).

Throughout the 20th century, money creation remained 
a monopoly of government/central banks and commer -
cial banks. History has taught us that a monopoly on 
money coupled with irresponsible policymakers and/or commercial bankers under a fiat currency monetary system can create dire consequences for the populations they govern. Hayek argued that competition would alleviate this problem by producing “good money”. This was attributed to the idea that competition is a discov -
ery process with constant experimentation in which various improvements are offered to users of money (Hayek, 1978b). Of necessity, such improvements are subjective and dependent on changeable market opin -
ions and demands. As a result, economist Anthony Endres suggests that there may be no point in drawing a sharp distinction between what is money and what is not; competition over different forms of monies should result in discoveries, modifications and service inno -
vations that no one currency producer anticipates or intends (Endres, 2009). It would be unconvincing to suppose that currency was invented in a manner that determines its properties and use for all times and places. This viewpoint led Hayek to question the use -
fulness of any international agreement to adopt a mon -
etary management system: Why	should	we	not	let 	
people	choose	freely	what 	
money	they	want	to	use?	… 	
the	best	thing	we	could 	
wish	governments	to	do	is

to bind themselves

another’s	–	or	any	other	– 	
currencies, 	including	the	
purchase and sale at any price the parties decide upon,	or	on	their	use	as 	
accounting units.
– Hayek, 1978a.“

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
Since currencies issued by governments pursuing re -
sponsible monetary policy would tend to displace grad -
ually those of a less-reliable character, competition 
would “impose the most effective discipline on govern -
ments” for the appropriate management of the quan -
tity of currency in circulation (Hayek, 1978a, p.21), protecting money from political manipulations such as those of Nixon and Burns. To avoid the inflationary bias inherent in any international monetary policy coordi -
nation, Hayek suggested that national currencies should be related by a system of flexible, market-determined exchange rates, and individuals should be allowed to substitute between various currencies without govern -
ment prohibition. As evidence, economist Benjamin Craig showed that the Russian monetary authority in the 1990s was induced to target a lower level of inflation as dollars were increasingly held and used illegally by residents (Craig, 1996).
As every currency is potentially capable of playing a 
role as an international vehicle for quoting prices and settling trades across national borders, Harvard polit -
ical economist Benjamin Friedman sees that the dimin -
ishing effectiveness of national monetary policies are inevitable, if not desirable. Diminishing loyalty to any single central-bank-issued money, the growth of non -
bank credit, and technological advances are weakening the monetary control of central banks (Friedman, 1999). In recent years we have already witnessed the emer -
gence of various global digital currencies, in line with the claim of economic historian Charles Kindleberger who argued that the market will create additional mon -
ey to suit it’s needs and where official sources limit it’s supply, the market will react by producing more (Kind -
legerger, 1989).” It seems the discovery process of cur -rency competition envisioned by Hayek has been in full force, and we are to expect more discoveries from pri -
vate innovation in the dynamic process of opinion formation in the market.
Critics of Hayek have argued that bad money will drive 
out good money. This has become known as Gresham’s Law, which argues that when two forms of commodity monies are in circulation, and both are accepted as legal tender with the same face value, the intrinsically more valuable money will gradually disappear from circulation as people hoard their ‘good money’ and spend their ‘bad money’. The principle was demonstrat -
ed in the United States when older half dollar coins with 90% silver were hoarded and melted down by the pub -
lic after the government had introduced newer ones with only 40% silver in 1965. These newer coins even -
tually also disappeared from circulation when the government gave up including any silver in half dollar coins in 1971. This shows that legal tender laws could motivate buyers/debtors to offer only money with the lowest commodity value (bad money), since sellers/creditors are required by laws to accept such money at face value. 
In absence of effective legal tender laws, Gresham’s Law 
could also work in reverse. This was demonstrated in post-WW1 Germany when consumers fled from cash to hard assets as circulating medium of exchange after the hyper-inflation in 1922 (a similar trend was ob -
served during the hyper-inflation events in Zimbabwe). Given the choice of what money to accept, sellers/cred -
itors can now demand only money with the highest long-term value, further reducing the acceptability and value of bad money. This coincides with Hayek’s insight 26

the Fractional r eserve s yste M

As the international monetary system evolved in the 
20th century, fractional reserve banking has remained 
widespread. In fact the practice dates as far back as the 1300s, 8 but is not well understood by the public or ac -
ademic textbooks.                               
The fractional reserve system is a banking system in 
which all depository institutions-commercial banks, credit unions and other banks—are required to main -
tain reserves against transaction deposits, which include demand deposits, negotiable order of with -
drawal accounts, and other highly liquid funds. Re -
serves against these deposits can take the form either of currency on hand (vault cash) or balances at the Central Bank.

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
Fractional reserve banking 
can be simply explained using the scenario to the left where 1,000 units of central bank issued ‘base money’ is depos -
ited at a commercial bank. Where the bank is required to hold a percentage (10 in this case) of their loan liabilities in reserves, they can loan out 900 units backed by a 100-unit deposit (first row). If we sup -
pose that the household tak -
ing the loan purchases a house from another household, the house seller will likely depos -
it those funds back in the bank. In this case, the bank can again lend out 90% of those new deposits (second row). As this cycle continues, the amount of ‘broad money’ in the economy grows signifi -
cantly (second and third row). In the last row, there is now 3,439 units of total money in the economy from the initial 1,000 units in central bank-is -
sued money.
To give a practical example, in 
the UK about 97% of the broad money supply is made up of uncollateralized loans, with only about 3% supported by actual cash. This system comes with both advantages (more liquidity for small businesses and households) and disadvan -
tages (the moral hazard prob -
lem and boom-bust cycles). Central banks still maintain control over the supply of mon -
ey but this is through a combi -
nation of influencing interest rates and setting capital re -
serve requirements and ade -
quacy ratios.    FIgure	2

(a) Balance sheets are highly stylised for ease of exposition: the quantities of each type of 
money shown do not correspond to the quantities actually held on each sector’s balance 
sheet.
(b) Central bank balance sheet only shows base money liabilities and the correspond -
ing assets. In practice the central bank holds other non-money liabilities. Its 
non-monetary assets are mostly made up of government debt. Although that government debt is actually held by the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility, so does not appear directly on the balance sheet.
(c) Commercial banks’ balance sheets only show money assets and liabilities before any 
loans are made.28
Much like the move from the gold standard to fiat mon -
ey, fractional reserve banking relies on an uncollater -
alized reliance on public trust – as long as there are no 
runs on the bank, fractional reserve banking can func -
tion well, with commercial banks creating new money through uncollateralized loans to finance innovative new companies. The flexibility in creating loans and money facilitates business borrowing and investment, hence further expanding economic activities during booms. However, fractional reserve banking is a dou -
ble-edged sword: the very same flexibility can also aggravate economic contraction during busts. 
To understand the mechanism, notice that money (de -
mand deposits) in a fractional reserve banking system 
is either backed up by cash or created through bank loans. Whenever a bank loan is repaid, the total amount of cash remains unchanged. A reduction in bank loan hence implies a reduction of money supply in the system. In other words, bank loan reduction – either by repay -
ment or declaration as bad debt - destroys money. 
The negative effect of such monetary contraction  chan -
nels was demonstrated in the United States during the 
Great Depression. As the stock market crash in October 1929 made it difficult for businesses to repay their loans, the balance sheets of many US banks eroded. To satis -
fy the legal reserve requirement, these banks had to call loans to reduce their demand deposits, which led to even more bad debt, given many businesses were already experiencing financial difficulty. As a result, panics spread and generated the first wave of bank runs in late 1930, with 352 banks failing in December 1930 alone. the ultimate constraint on money creation is

Deflation
Through the mechanism explained above, money sup -
ply contracted substantially, leading to debt deflation 
and further bad debt. The contagion of fear and prop -
agation of bank runs continued until Spring of 1933, in total cutting the price level in the United States by half and destroying eight billion dollars or one-third of demand deposits in the United States. Having ob -
served this vicious cycle during the Great Depression, Nobel laureate economist Irving Fisher proposed the Chicago Plan as a way insure 100% of reserves.

The origins of the Chicago Plan can be attributed 
back to the United Kingdom where the 1921 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, Frederick Soddy shifted his focus to the inefficiencies and unfairness inher -
ent in fractional reserve systems of ‘virtual wealth’ (Soddy, 1933). The ideas of Soddy were embraced by Professor Frank Knight in 1927 at the University of Panics

Chicago. In practice, however, the challenges of frac -
tional reserve banking are made clear only during times of panic or financial crises. In the aftermath of the Great Depression, a significant conglomerate of University of Chicago economists, along with prominent monetary economist Irvin Fisher at Yale, supported Knight’s proposals to reform the financial system and sent a detailed memorandum to President Roosevelt in November 1933 (see Simons et al.,1933). Following the Great Depression, Fisher envisioned the Chicago Plan as “a way to use monetary policy to affect debtor-creditor relations through reflation, in an environment where, in his opinion, over-in -
debtedness had become a major source of crises for the economy”. (Benes and Kumhof, 2012). Fisher was a pioneer in advocating for the requirement of a 100% cash reserve behind all demand deposits, a proposal subsequently known as the Chicago Plan (Fisher, 1936; Simons, 1946). Fisher observed that the volume of demand deposits was highly unstable because of the fractional reserve banking system. By eliminat -

ing the possibility of bank runs, he believed the 
proposal would speedily and permanently prevent an economic recession from spiralling into depres -
sion by i) increasing control of sudden increases and contractions of bank credit and of the supply of bank-created money, ii) eliminating the possibility of bank runs, iii) dramatically reducing the net pub -
lic debt and iv) dramatically reducing private debt (as money creation would no longer require simulta -
neous debt creation) (see Tobin, 1985; Minsky, 1992, 1994; Benes and Kumhof, 2012).
In simple terms, under the Chicago Plan, all demand 
deposits held by commercial banks must be matched by an underlying asset such as cash. This means that these banks cannot lend out customers’ demand de -
posits as they do under the fractional reserve system, which would significantly decrease liquidity in 100%- backed reserve countries (for example 97% of money in the UK would need to be replaced with central bank base money). As banks can only lend against proven reserves, the risk of bank runs would vanish, so that banks need not call loans during economic downturn to worsen the liquidity of businesses. On top of resolv -
ing the coordination failure of banks during bad times, banks could also benefit from such arrangements, as more savings and time deposits would be brought to banks due to freedom of the economy from great booms and depressions. 
More importantly, the government could regain its 
sovereign power over money under the Chicago Plan. By prohibiting banks from manufacturing the money they lend, but still allowing banks to lend money as they please, the government could nationalize money without nationalizing banking. With a 100% cash re -
serve requirement, all the money on deposits now fully belong to the depositors, so that banks act mere -
ly as their trustees or custodians. The absence of lever -
age in the Chicago Plan, Fisher believed, could there -
fore prevent the freezing of loans during a depression, and effectively eliminate the management and domi -
nation of industry by banks during bad times. In the words of Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Finance Times, this will end the “too big to fail” for banking (Wolf, 2014).

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
We can get a better idea of the role that trust has come to play in money by examining four simple scenarios from 
a balance sheet perspective. 
The first scenario involves a transaction between the central bank and household under the gold standard (or any 
other asset-backed money such as stablecoins). Because paper money is backed by physical gold (or another valuable asset), this scenario does not require households to have an implicit trust in the central bank, as each unit they borrow is backed by a unit of physical gold of the same value.

In the third more realistic scenario, the central bank lends 100 in fiat currency to a commercial bank who, under fractional reserve banking, can lend out more money than they hold on deposits (say 90%). In this case there now exists several rela -

cial banks, depositors, borrowers, and the central bank.32

At this point, there exists 100 units 
in central bank (narrow/outer) money, which requires a relation -

As noted above, the only time where the vulnerabilities are exposed in the fiat currency fractional reserve system is when trust in these institutions erodes. 
Lastly, in scenario 4 we can impose 
the Chicago Plan restrictions on scenario 3, which now requires com -
mercial banks to hold an equivalent value of assets to their liabilities (demand deposits). In this case, commercial banks would need to borrow at least 900 units from the central banks in order to fulfil the 100% reserve requirement.

–Comparing this with a peer-to-peer issued cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, in scenario 5 no liability is created when 
a bitcoin is mined. For example, the supply of bitcoin is increased by rewarding those who successfully validate transactions making it a transaction and not a financial contract (as was the case with bank money). The issuer is not an institution or entity and the currency is not backed by any authority. This creates a challenge when accounting for Bitcoin. One option is to treat it like monetary gold, which is the only existing financial asset with no liability. But as noted by the BOE,

–Once cryptocurrencies have been acquired, users do not need rely on 
trust between themselves or any institution to ensure its value because of the collective security embedded in the blockchain technology. This means that miner 1 can make transactions with miner 2 without any requirement that they trust each other. (see scenario 7 below) Again, this is similar to trading with physical gold (or under the gold standard) but does not require a physical validation of the legitimacy of the gold.
Note that cryptocurrencies in this example are limited to transactions and not financial contracts. This means that no financial relationships are created and no liabilities will exist on anyone’s balance sheet. In the case of Bitcoin, these tokens are created by a mining reward algorithm and backed by the collective pool of people who own it. If that collective pool loses trust in bitcoin, its value diminishes.  In the case of stablecoins, the collective pool is assured of the value of their currency by the holding of high-quality assets of equivalent value.
In summary the leveraged way in which money is currently being created has the potential to (again) destabilize 
financial systems only when trust in those institutions erodes. These destabilizations often lead to short revivals of Austrian school ideas regarding the role of money and banking in society (for example, Fishers seminal paper following the Great Depression). It is likely no coincidence that the Nakamoto (2008) paper emerged at the same time as the most recent financial crisis was occurring. In fact, one of the core motivations of Bitcoin’s creators was the eradication of middlemen and/or money creators who profit from these activities.

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
According to modern international standards, “broad 
money” is defined as “all liquid financial instruments held by money-holding sectors that are widely accepted in an economy as a medium of exchange, plus those that can be converted into a medium of exchange at short notice at, or close to, their full nominal value.” 
10 (IMF, 2016, p.180) 
In a 21st century context, these would include, fiat curren -
cies issued by central banks, short-term digital credit fa -
cilities (swaps, credit cards, paypal, googlepay, payday loans, WePay, AliPay, M-Pesa, etc.), digital currencies is -
sued by private sector/nonprofits or central banks (Bitcoin, Libra, etc). From the discussion in Chapters 1 and 2, we can begin by distinguishing currency types across five attributes, including: i) who issues and backs the currency, ii) how acceptable is the currency, iii) are there transaction costs, iv) how stable is the value over time (inflation/de -
flation), and, v) is it digital/electronic or physical.  Each type of money has both benefits and drawbacks in terms of its usefulness. For example, a credit card (digital) is widely accepted but may come with trans -
action costs and is backed by a private sector corpora -
tion, while cash (physical) may be less widely accepted but has no transaction costs and is backed by the central bank. This is why many forms of money coexist. In fact, it is not uncommon for people to use more than one form of money in a given day/week, making some pay -
ments with cash (a central bank liability) and some others with transfers or credit cards (which are private sector forms of money). To get a better understanding of current usage of types of money, we asked 1,000 respondents across eight countries (Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, Spain, UK, USA) what types of money they most commonly use. The results are shown below. A.	types	of	Money

Existing research has focused on the degree of centralization (issuer/backer), accessibility, and digital/physical 
nature of money. For example, Berentsen & Schar (2018b) studied the different types of currencies and systems of payments and their properties. In their research, they argue that Bitcoin specifically, but other decentralized cryptocurrencies in general, use blockchain technology to present a unique type of currency. Each “coin” (unit of money) is issued in a competitive setting and has both a virtual representation and a decentralized transac -
tion process. Because of these properties, decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can be considered a fun -
damentally different type of money when compared to the traditional forms we are used to (commodity money, cash, and others). 
In their study of the different types of currencies, Berentsen & Schar (2018b) propose a control structure to vi -
sually represent these different types according to three dimensions. Figure 4 presents this control structure and 
where in this visual classification different types of currencies are located. Source: CGC, Cryptocurrencies and The Future of Money: International Survey.FIgure	3

As demonstrated in Chapter 2, it is important here to distinguish between narrow money that is created by 
central banks from broad money created by commercial bank deposits and central bank cash. Both of these centralized institutions make up almost all of money we currently use and act as clearing houses for almost all of our money transactions (system of payments). A recent IMF report has argued that these “two most common forms of money today will face tough competition and could even be surpassed. Cash and bank deposits will battle with e-money, electronically stored monetary value denominated in, and pegged to, a common unit of account such as the euro, dollar, or renminbi, or a basket thereof” (Adrian and Mancini-Griffoli, 2019, p.1).  Building on this and the work of other academics/institutions, the IMF has recently provided a further dissection of money according to its ‘type’ (is it a claim on another entity or an object), ‘value’ (fixed, variable or a unit of account), ‘backstopper’ (government, private sector), and, degree of centralization (‘technology’). From Figure 5 below, we can see that several types of digital money have already been widely adopted (AliPay, WeChat Pay, M-Pesa), while others probably do not qualify as money based on our definition of broad money above.

Thinking about this in the context of cryptocurrencies, these are interesting because they bring a combination 
of new and old ideas about money. Firstly, ownership rights are managed in a decentralized network as argued by Hayek using a distributed ledger (no backstop). Because of this, there is no central authority responsible for managing currency ownership rights, ensuring price stability, and regulating illicit transactions. Blockchain technology also has a decentralized accounting system where “miners” are the book keepers and no debtor/creditor relationship (i.e. cryptocurrencies are not a liability on anyone’s balance sheet). This decentralized management of ownership of digital assets is a fundamental innovation of Nakamoto (2008). More importantly, the system of payments infrastructure envisioned by Nakamoto (2008) was created with the intention to disrupt the current financial system, by affecting all business and government agencies that have monopolized the creation of money in the 20
th century. With these new innovations in the early 21st century, some writers have 
argued that this will mark the death of cash.Source: Adrian and Mancini-Griffoli, 2019.decentralized (de)centralized decentralized

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
why r eplace c ash?
–
In order to change a system, it helps to have a problem 
with the existing one. This is a view shared by many economists and policymakers who see physical cash and existing digital money created by the central bank and commercial banks as doing a pretty good job, meaning there is no need to take unnecessary risks by adopting an entirely new, and potentially risky, form of money. So why has there been such a large push for the adoption of digital currencies? 
Some of the well-known downfalls of physical money 
are the need for the buyer and the seller to be physical -
ly present at the same location, or have a geographical connection to deliver the cash, which makes its use time consuming and impracticable for online commerce.
Studies have also found 
that physical cash is a public health concern, finding traces of faecal matter, cocaine, heroine, and bacteria (among others) on dollar bills, making it a good candi -
date for spreading dis -
ease across large popu -
lations, leading experts to conclude that “if the question of a cashless society is approached purely from a public health standpoint, the answer seems clear” (Maron, 2017). 
10 This would be especially important in low in -
come countries who are more vulnerable to epidemics.
Another drawback of cash relates to tax evasion and 
the financial operations of illegal activities, which have become increasingly salient since the publica -
tion of Panama Papers in 2015 and Paradise Papers in 2017. Money laundering, financing of illegal ac -
tivities and tax evasion all pose a pervasive challenge to society in both developing and developed coun -
tries. In his study of how physical cash is related to the daily financing of these illegal activities, Sands (2016) suggests an interesting approach in order to fight these financial crimes. His proposal is to elim -
inate high denomination notes (he gives as examples the €500 note, the $100 bill, the CHF1,000 note and the £50 note). According to the author, these notes are preferred in illegal activities, given the anonym -
ity and lack of transaction record in cash payment system. Moreover, because they are of high value, it is easier to transport and execute payments of large value. By eliminating high denomination notes, it is argued that we would make life a lot harder for those perusing tax evasion, financial crime, terrorist fi -
nance and corruption. Without being able to use high denomination notes, those engaged in illicit activi -
ties would face higher costs and greater risk of de -
tection. The author concludes that the benefits from the elimination of such high denomination notes far outperform the drawbacks. Given the availability and effectiveness of electronic payment alternatives, these high denomination notes play little role in the B.	the	end	of	Cash?

functioning of the legitimate 
economy, yet a crucial role in the underground economy.
In “The Curse of Cash”, Rogoff 
(2017) goes one step further. While Sands (2016) advocates for the eradication of high denomina -
tion notes, Rogoff (2017) advo -
cates getting rid of cash once and for all. He extends the argument of Sands (2016) by linking the in -
creasing amount of money in cir -
culation to the volume of cash be -
ing used for tax evasion, corruption, terrorism, the drug trade, human traffic; in summary, by all sorts of illegal activities. Nevertheless, he expands the benefits of eliminating cash to monetary policy. If policy makers not only eradicated high denomi -
nations, but all notes (except very small denomination ones and coins), Rogoff (2017) argues that this would in fact increase the ef -
fectiveness of monetary policy by, for example, allowing for negative interest rates. The idea of Sands (2016) and Rogoff (2017) that physical cash makes the financing of illegal activities significantly easier cannot be ignored. In fact, Brazil’s Car Wash operation, the biggest corruption scandal ever uncovered in history, showed that companies involved in illegal do -
nations to parties developed very sophisticated methods to raise physical cash. They collected cash from different small business, sometimes even paying a premi -
um in order to hold cash, so that they could use this cash to per -
form their illegal activities. Cash, however, still maintains some unique advantages in com -
parison to other existing types of currencies discussed above. Users of cash can remain anonymous, in the case of stable advanced econ -
omies it is widely accepted/trust -
ed by sellers, and there is free ac -
cess to cash payment systems (no transaction costs). Users of cash also do not need to open bank ac -
counts or create a digital wallet to use physical cash. Transactions are final and people can engage in trade even if they do not know or trust each other. The electronic money that we currently hold in commercial banks, on the other hand, involves counterparty risk, requires the use of a bank account and often has charges relating to transactions (for example, trans -
fers to other accounts). 
11
Berentsen and Schar (2018a) believe that there is a great de -
mand for currencies issued by a trusted party to save outside the financial system. To prove their point, they present the number of Swiss Francs in cir -
culation as a fraction of GDP from 1980 to 2017 (see Figure 6 below). We can see that after the crisis the demand for Swiss Francs increased significantly.

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
This shift is explained as a move to 
safety - the financial crisis and the subsequent euro crisis have in -
creased the demand for cash exact -
ly because it is the most liquid asset for savings outside of the private financial system. In other words, cash has been used as an insurance against the insolvency of financial institutions.
Further evidence of the growing de -
mand for physical cash issued by a 
trusted backer was shown by a 2019 IMF Finance and Development arti -
cle (‘Boom in the Benjamins’) which attributed a rise in $100 bills to an increased global demand for the US dollars as a safe haven, as well as its ideal anonymous role in illicit trans -
actions in the underground economy. High denomination notes also offer higher seignorage returns for the Federal Reserve, making the $100 bill the most profitable to print. This combination of factors lead the au -
thors to conclude that American dollar bills are not likely to dissipate any time soon (Weir, 2019). 
The extent that fiat money will be 
used as an insurance mechanism depends on the degree of trust that holders of that money have in its issuer. In this sense, Switzerland and the US would be exceptional cases where a run to safety resulted in an increase in the demand for cash in stable economies. Bech et al. (2018) show that the amount of cash in circulation has increased or re -
mained stable in a large number of stable advanced economies (see Figure 8). Although the value of card payments has increase significantly, Sweden is the only country where the cash in circulation has actually decreased between 2007 and 2016.

As noted above, several centralized digital alternatives to physical cash have already become successful systems 
of payments. For example, M-Pesa in Kenya (see Jack and Suri, 2014; Kaminska, 2015), AliPay in China, and PayPal in the US (among many others). Cryptocurrency enthusiasts, central banks, and entrepreneurs are also continually improving the design of blockchain-based digital currencies to rectify some of the practical defects in previous designs. For example, Facebooks Libra will be backed by a portfolio of underlying assets and will be managed to maintain price stability (a ‘stablecoin’) which was a key fault in Bitcoin’s ability to function as a true currency. While these ‘updated’ cryptocurrencies still have practical drawbacks such as high fees, scaling issues, and a lack of widespread trust, these problems could be improved upon over time with the emergence of large-scale off-chain payment networks and transparent management. It is also important to remember that digital curren -
cies are still fiat money which relies on a relationship of trust between the issuer and the user.  Source: Bech et al., 2018.FIgure	8

ledGers
–
Ledgers have existed and evolved as a form of account -
ing for over a millennium. For example, ledgers were 
found to be used by Mesopotamian’s (modern day Iraq) as far back as 3200 BC to record expenditures, traded goods and record accounts payable on Clay Tablets (kept safe in temples, considered banks of the time). Then ledgers were used in 633 BC by Persian civilisations as an auditing tool to regulate the collection of alms (wealth tax). During the Middle Ages, there was a scar -
city in gold across Britain, which caused a decline in circulation of coins; as a result the Exchequer introduced tally sticks as a physical proof of payment, whereby the stick would be split in half. One half was kept as stock by the payer (contract), and the other half as debt re -
tained by the Exchequer. Hence, when accounts were audited, the pieces were fitted together to check they ‘tallied’. 
12 By the 14th century, tally sticks had spread 
across Europe, fundamentally acknowledging the emer -
gence of debt and contracts, which were used to pay wages to workers and taxes to the state, and also traded to buy and sell items, similar to coins. They were differ -
ent in that they also acted as an ‘IOU’ pledge, whereby whoever issued the stock was liable to pay in gold who -
ever owned the other half of the stick. Thus, the stock had a value in gold, and could be spent accordingly to the same value of actual gold. Thus far, a ‘ledger’ is defined as an information store that keeps a final and definitive records of transactions, and a ‘transaction’ is defined as a smallest unit of work process resulting in a state change (ISO, 2008, definition 3.5). By 1497 Merchants in Venice had advanced accounting systems to create a new financial services industry. This was captured by the Italian church father and mathema -
tician Luca Bartolomes Pacioli, who published the first book on double entry system of accounting, highlighting that any given new transaction fundamentally changes either the debit or credit position of the account, to give an actual value of a business.  Other than advancements in technology and general digitalisation, accounting and bookkeeping have not really progressed beyond Excel spreadsheets and have become more complex, which re -
quires qualified professionals to maintain accounting re -
cords across multiple accounts (ledgers). 
From an accounting perspective, key advancements in 
blockchain technology are the abilities for participants to share one single synchronised, distributed ledger of transactions, and for the underlying consensus protocol (a set of rules) to successfully ensure each node on a network agrees on the data being shared on the ledger.  
networks  
–
Blockchains, or DLTs, consist of a network of nodes, where 
a network is defined as an interconnected system of things. The best way to understand the relationship between nodes and networks is a visual representation  seen in Figure 
11 where decentralized networks have multiple sources of control and distributed networks distribute control equal -
ly across all participants in that network, whereas cen -
tralised networks have one central source of control.

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
In practice, most popular cryptocurrencies were designed to be payment 
tokens which is the type that we will consider in the next sections. The Rand Corporation described these networks back in the 1960s (Barand, 1964), describing the type of interconnection between the nodes and the type of information flow between them for transaction and/or the purpose of validation. For efficiency reasons, systems have historically been designed in a cen -
tralised manner. This centralisation dramatically lowers the costs for system configuration, maintenance, adjustment (and the costs of arbi -
tration in case of conflict) as this work must be performed only once in a central place. While highly ef -
ficient in many situations, this kind of systems induce a single (or very limited set of) point(s) of failure and suffers from scalability issues (Tas -
ca and Tessone, 2018).
In a highly centralised system, all 
the nodes (and all the users on a node) are connected to the central node (a ‘dictator’ model). Most social and monetary networks are cen -
tralised systems, where all partici -
pants have relationships with cen -
tralised hubs (i.e. a central bank). However, the Internet was not real -
ly designed to be like that (i.e. for centralised business models), rather, for information to be decentralised and accessible and not controlled by one central hub. The distributed network on the other hand, main -

ness models, which give rise to the motivation behind the creation of crypto currencies.
We can think broadly about crypto -
currencies based on the economic 
goals of the network (or protocals). As will be shown in section C, there are many types of blockchain based tokens backed by different consen -
sus protocols, most of which fall into one of three main categories: Image Source: Baran, 1964.Centralized Decentralized distributed50
The motivation behind Bitcoin and other DLT appara -
tuses involves the application of cryptography to mon -
etary networks in order to eliminate trusted third 
parties across messaging systems. Most people already use cryptography when using internet applications, in sending or signing off on packets of data or messages (e.g. the https protocol for internet browsing or Whatsapp for secure peer-to-peer messaging). Encrypt -
ed messages prevent observations from an intermedi -
ary, and signing  preventing tampering of data have 
eliminated the need to trust a third party to carry the message, for example SMSs where data packets go through centralised data exchanges usually adminis -
tered by Telcom service providers. When considering the innovation of blockchain, it allows the same, the elimination of third parties in financial transactions through the use of payment tokens.
Some of the benefits of blockchain technology applied 
to monetary systems are:
 ▷Decentralisation  – no single point of trust, 
no single point of control (no central author-ity), no single point of failure
 ▷Security and Anonymity – non-repudiation

sioned Bitcoin becoming a digital payment system with emphasis on a key innovation called ‘decentralisation’ : 
removing the need for a trusted third-party institution in processing transactions, whose rules are enforced by consensus, with anyone  being able to participate. 
Nakamoto frames the discussion around the trusted third-party issue in economic terms, arguing that:B.	What	were

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
The focal point here is not money itself, but the way 
money is used and managed (system of payments), specifically with no intermediation. In fact, cryptocur -
rencies have several similar characteristics to cash (low transaction cost, quasi-anonymity). The key difference envisioned by Nakamoto was the stripping out of a centralized authority and clearing house for money, instead having transactions verified by a global group of participants using blockchain technology (similar to Figure 11).

As noted above, this change to the system of payments is the true innovation of Nakamoto, not money itself. This 
was highlighted in a 2016 speech by the deputy governor of the Bank of England:    
the	main	point	here	is	that	the	important	innovation	in	Bitcoin	isn’t 	
the	alternative	unit	of	account	–	it	seems	very	unlikely	that,	to	any 	
significant	extent,	we’ll	ever	be	paying	for	things	in	Bitcoins,	rather 	
than	pounds,	dollars	or	euros	–	but	its	settlement	technology,	the 	
so-called	“distributed	ledger”.	t his	allows	transfers	to	be	verifiably 	
recorded	without	the	need	for	a	trusted	third	party.	It	is	potentially 	
valuable	when	there	is	no	such	institution	and	when	verifying	such 	
information	on	a	multilateral	basis	is	costly.

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
Why Decentralize? 
–
When considering existing (digital) 
business models, which are all pre -
dominantly centralised, there are certain risks involved to network users. 
13 Some of these risks include:
 ▷Single-point failure
 ▷Exclusion, abuse, and 
mistrust
 ▷Low Transparency and  
high transaction fees 
Single Points of Failure
–
Looking back at previous figures on pages 51 and 53, Figure 11 and Fig -
ure 13, it should be clear that a peer-to-peer decentralized pay -
ment system is inherently more robust than a payment system re -
quiring an intermediary or clearing house. Bitcoin achieves this by using a blockchain-based consen -
sus mechanism to manage an agreement on the state of a distrib -
uted database. While the network relies on the underlying Internet connectivity (which is itself decen -
tralised), there is no single entity whose failure would disrupt the network. Centralised payment sys -
tems are exposed to failures of hardware and breaches of security procedures which, in the worst cases, can bring the whole payment network down (as was the case for Visa in Europe on 1 June 2018). Having a decentralised network ensures that the failure or break -

world internet u sers and s ecure internet s erversdown of any node cannot disrupt the entire system. For example, if a central clearing house (say the central bank) was to suffer an attack, this would prevent the entire monetary system from functioning in a cen -
tralised system; whereas, an attack on a server in the Bitcoin network would have no effect on the functioning of the system (i.e. users could still make transactions using Bitcoin).  
Exclusion, abuse and mistrust
–
Blockchain-based permissionless cryptocurrencies have, by design, a 
uniquely low barrier for entry – any individual can participate in the payment system as long as they have access to an Internet connection. This makes it possible for anyone to actively participate in the system and ensure the accountability of others in the network. With 1.7bn people in the world without access to a bank account, regular payment providers have often failed to provide access to an effective payments system. This is especially true in the midst of a worldwide surge in access to the Inter -
net and secure internet servers as can be seen in the Figure 14 below. 
54
The decentralized network also prevents a centralized au -
thority from excluding members participation or abusing 
their unique position as the only group with access to a private ledger. This lack of transparency in a centralized system can lead to popular mistrust, which is remedied by allowing all participants access to a common decentralized ledger. 
High Transaction Fees
–
With the invention of electronic transfers (credit cards, 
debit cards, etc.), financial transactions have become con -
siderably cheaper and more efficient over the past thirty years. There do remain some types of transactions which require significant third-party fees to complete.
The most prevalent of these would be transactions involv -
ing multiple currencies (i.e. remittances, tourism, imports/
exports of goods and services). For example, looking at data from the World Bank for remittance fees over the 2011–2017 period, we can see that remittance fees to some countries are still close to 20%, and still range around 10% in strong emerging economies like China and Thailand.  
A more extreme, and persistent, example of high third-par -
ty fees is the exchange of currencies at international air -

security and a nony Mity o F participants
–
While blockchain-based transactions are public by the na -
ture of the payment protocol, blockchain-based cryptocur -
rencies are ‘pseudonymous’. Transactions can be linked to 
the public keys they originated from and were sent to, but it is much harder to establish a link between a public key and the identity of the person making the transaction. No -
tably, the transaction is ‘pseudonymous’ not only from the broader public, but also from the other counterparty – not unlike a cash transaction between two strangers. This se -
curity and anonymity removes the risk of a financial inter -
mediary misusing client details, having them unintention -
ally stolen or legally sharing them with third parties (e.g. a suppressive government) without the explicit consent of the client. This pseudo-anonymity also helps to overcome some of the problems with purely anonymous cash identified by Sands and Rogoff from Chapter 3. For example, large move -
ment of funds could be followed as they move through the network, allowing for law enforcement to track conspicuous transactions across the globe. 
trANSpAreNCy,	AUDItABILIty	AND	GoVer-

Similar to banks, blockchain-based cryptocurrencies 
record all transactions in a secure and immutable ledger. The blockchain is a transactions ledger of tokens where the entire history of transactions is recorded. One block contains a group of transactions and has a unique point -
er that refers to previous blocks in the chain. In contrast to centralized systems or banks, in the case of Bitcoin, the ledger is not stored in one ‘safe’ place. Instead, ev -
eryone using Bitcoin (i.e. who has the core software) is connected through a peer-to-peer network and saves a replica of the Bitcoin’s blockchain (ledger). There are many replicas of the same ledger existing on multiple machines, guaranteeing its safety against system fail -
ures or attacks and full transparency for all users on the network. Effectively, this means that anyone can access and audit records of all pseudo-anonymous transactions and does not require intervention or permission from a third party (i.e. a central bank).
As depicted in Figure 16, this system allows buyers and 
sellers of goods and services to interact in a transparent manner with each other without needing a central bank or commercial bank to act as an intermediary, or back -
er of the currency used to make the transaction. For example, with Bitcoin, everyone can download the soft -
ware, transfer fee-free money, store the ledger and even maintain it, democratizing the control over the system.
Transparency is a key component for trust to be estab -
lished. As modern commercial banks have scaled up

border business models, participants have become identified as a ‘number’ and see the running of opera -
tions inside the banks as ‘black box systems of author -
ity’. This has led to less direct means of interaction, 
transparency, and understanding of what banks actu -
ally do (this will be explored further in Chapter 6).
14
The advantages in building trust through increased transparency and auditability of blockchain-based crytpocurrencies has led some experts to conclude that distributed ledgers will overtake the centralized insti -
tutional framework as seen in Figure 17. 
For any new technological innovations to be adopted 
and scaled, there is a trust barrier that needs to be overcome which, as will be shown in Chapter 6, is cer -
tainly the case with cryptocurrencies. Technological innovations can arise from a lack of trust in existing systems (for example, lower levels of trust in tradition -
al authorities during periods of hyperinflation). To overcome the trust barrier in cryptocurrencies, it is helpful to review the governance frameworks, or, con -
sensus protocols. 
Governance in DLT frameworks is inherently more 
democratic than the traditional centralised clearing house frameworks. The degree of democratization depends partly on the decision algorithm adopted (consensus protocol). Consensus protocols allow a decentralised network to arrive at an agreement about the state of the blockchain. There are different proto -
cols for different types of blockchains and each has its pros and cons. In general, a DLT participant must val -
idate transactions (either individually or in a set or block) before they can be added to the distributed ledger. This means that general DLT consists of a net -
work of nodes - called ‘validators’, because nodes are completing validation function. In a permission-less DLT (i.e. for most cryptocurrencies), the set of nodes that can validate transactions are generally not known, so we need a way to ensure that the behaviour of the system matches the expectations of its users.

In the case of most cryptocurren -
cies, these are a subset of partici -
pants depending on the consensus 
protocol, which can be broadly classified as:

pools 
 ▷Proof of Stake - Endoge -
nously wealthy token holders 
 ▷Exogenously wealthy actors 
who pay-to-play, in some other casesProof of Work
–
In the proof of work governance model, prospective validators (‘min -
ers’) solve a puzzle that is easy to verify but hard to guess without a time-consuming brute-force ap -
proach. Some examples would in -
clude Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, ZCash, Monero (and many more). In terms of advantages, cheat -
ing is difficult, given the large vol -
ume of participants, and taking over the network is expensive. In terms of disadvantages, the network is run by those who have access to cheap elec -tricity, whose interests may not match those of users in general. Countless computations are spent in a zero-sum arms race with negative externalities such as pollution and depletion of natural resources. 
Proof of Stake

In the proof of stake governance 
model Prospective validators de -
posit tokens in exchange for the chance (proportional to the size of the deposit) to be selected for block creation. If a validator pro -

duces (or votes on, depending upon implementation) 
a block that is added to the chain, then it receives a reward. Otherwise, it loses the security deposit. Some examples would include Ethereum (Serenity), Tender -
mint, and NXT. In terms of advantages, the Proof of Stake consensus protocol replaces mining with a bet -
ting system that is more energy efficient and shifts verification to those with a stake in the success of the network. In terms of disadvantages, control resides in the hands of those with the most tokens, whose in -
terests may not match those of users in general. A broader breakdown of consensus protocols is shown below in terms of their level of centralisation/decen -
tralisation.In summary, Cryptocurrencies propose to remedy three issues that exist in the current system of payments, mainly, the single point of failure that naturally emerg -
es from centralised/monopolised money, the anonym -
ity of participants, and the exclusion, abuse and trust of users in a system where money is monopolised by potentially irresponsible policymakers (as discussed in Chapter 1). Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies also provide a secure environment to transact with no need for expensive third parties and full transparency to all members of the network using a common distributed ledger. Lastly, the rules governing these currencies are democratised to allow for members to participate based on publicly available consensus protocols.

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
In practice, cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin) have 
become something different than what was envisioned by Nakamoto (2008). While there is a great deal of competition (Hayek money) in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin and other high-profile cryptocurrencies have failed to stabilize their value and subsequently increase their level of trust and acceptability (see Chap -
ter 6). There are also challenges when comparing spe -
cific features of cryptocurrencies discussed in theory (Section B) with cryptocurrencies in practice.
From 2013, the growth in the number of cryptocurren -
cies has been impressive. A 2019 Institute and Faculty 
of Actuaries paper reported that there were 66 varieties of crypto-assets in 2013, 644 in 2016, 1,335 at the end of 2017, and 2,116 in January of 2019. (Rochemont and Ward, 2019) The same trend has occurred in terms of market capitalization, where crypto-assets have grown exponentially from around USD 10 billion at end-2013 to USD 572.9 billion at end-2017. In terms of trading platforms for crypto assets, as of April 2018, the num-ber had exceeded 10,000. (Rochemont and Ward, 2019) 
Among the over 2,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, 
the market share distribution is relatively congested. Figure 19 shows a comparison between 18 cryptocur -
rencies. Using data collected from coinmetrics we show on the next page for the 18 cryptocurrencies the aver -
age daily active unique addresses (19A), the average number of blocks generated daily (19B), the average daily adjusted transaction volume (19C) and finally the average daily fees paid to miners (19D). Averages are c. cryptocurrencies in 
practice
60
calculated over the entire period of data which varies 
from 438 days (for Tezos) to 3903 days (for Bitcoin). The figure shows that although Bitcoin is the most widely known cryptocurrencies, in terms of the average daily transactions volume relatively new cryptocurrencies such as NEO are more used.In terms of usage, it is difficult to measure active par -
ticipants. The largest and most widely used cryptocur -
rency is Bitcoin, which, as of July 2014, had almost 41 million addresses listed on the Bitcoin block chain, but only 1.6 million that contained a balance of more than 0.001 bitcoins (roughly £0.35). 
This much smaller figure still overstates the number of 
users, however, as each user may possess any number of wallets and each wallet may hold any number of address -
es. In a 2018 survey of over 200 cryptocurrency owners, the Foundation for Interwallet Operability (FIO) found that only 30% of users sent any coins to a third party or alternative account at least once a month. A total of 43% of respondents sent coins to another party or made a purchase with cryptocurrencies only a few times during the entire year, and 27% sent no coins at all. From this, we could conclude that 70% of cryptocurrency holders either never or rarely used cryptocurrency for making any type of payments.
 Another way to estimate Bitcoin 
usage is through the number of venues that accept Bit -
coin. According to coinmap.org more the 15,000 venues accept Bitcoin. Leading software companies such as Microsoft accepts payment in Bitcoins. Expedia, the travel fares and hotel aggregator website, also accepts Bitcoin. Most importantly, digital banks such as Revolut allow their users to open accounts in Bitcoins and use it for payments.
Cryptocurrencies are purchased with an underlying unit 
of account (central bank-issued money). This allows us to see what currencies are being converted into crypto -
currencies, similar to looking at debt or equity by cur -
rency type to get an idea of who is holding that debt or equity. In August of 2014, a Bank of England Report estimated that almost 60% of Bitcoin trading was against the Chinese renminbi, 32% traded against the US dollar, 3% against the euro and 1.2% of trading was against the British pound (Ali et al, 2014). Since the publication of these figures, there have been significant changes in this composition.
After a 2017 Chinese government ban on trading bitcoin 
using renminbi, this composition looks dramatically different as of August of 2019. In the 30 day period leading up to August 24th, the US dollar made up around 43% (up from 32%), euro made up around 21% (up from 3%), yen made up around 14% and British pound made With the exponential growth in cryptocurrency ‘issuers’ comes a great deal of failed or fraudulent attempts to prof -
it from the hype. This can be best characterised in a 2018 article highlighting that “the cryptocurrency landscape is already littered with the ghosts of hundreds of dead coins that were too niche, too dumb, or blatant scams.” (Marvin, 2018) Of the 2,000+ surviving cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains, by far, the most dominant in terms of market capitalisation.

Given the current state of cryptocurrencies in practice, 
there remain several barriers to overcome when com -
paring these with the objectives from Nakamoto (2008) discussed above in Section B. We can classify some of these challenges as relating to:

 ▷Decentralization

token s upply
–
The supply of many cryptocurrencies increases at a fixed ‘controlled’ rate every year and is not actively managed by any centralized authority, which has led to wide swings in their value – for example, the value of 1 Bit -
coin climbed to almost 20,000 USD to fall back to around 3,000 USD before slightly rebounding and fluctuating around 10,000 USD over a short two-year period. 
In practice, the supply of Bitcoin is increased at a fixed 
rate by rewarding miners who are incentivized through award determined by a fixed schedule pre-programmed in the Bitcoin source code. As of 2019, the reward amounted to 12.5 BTC; however, every 210,000 blocks Bitcoin halves this reward to regulate the total supply of Bitcoin. Miners also can be rewarded by fees attached to the transactions they help record in a decentralized FIgure	20

ledger. This ability to increase the supply of Bitcoin through mining is similar to the supply of money under the gold standard, where it cannot be adjusted to meet economic circumstances. Recalling from Chapter 1, this was a significant contributor to the gold standard work -
ing “as the mechanism that turned an ordinary business downturn into the Great Depression” (Eichengreen and Temin, 1997, p.1). 62
Because the supply of money can -
not be actively adjusted to meet 
demand dramatic fluctuations in value of the most popular crypto -
currencies have occurred since their inceptions. This has led many observers, based on the three basic characteristics of money (unit of account, store of value, means of exchange) to rightly conclude that most cryptocurrencies are, in fact, not money.  In response to the large fluctuations in value, a second generation of cryptocurrency has been designed that pegs a token’s value to an ex -
isting currency or basket of curren -
cies. ‘Stablecoins’ are currently being used primarily as a tool for exchanges to trade between fiat and cryptocurrencies, and privately be -
tween large enterprises to settle trades. While stablecoins are very new at the time of writing this re -port, the future looks optimistic as evidenced by some high-profile projects listed below in Table 3.

point failures preventing exclu -

ducing unreasonably high fees. In 
practice, these still have barriers to overcome.
Single Point of Failure
While the mining activity is, in principle, decentralised and has very low barriers to entry (a comput -
er with Internet access), over time there are incentives for a degree of centralisation in the activity. With centralisation of mining activity, the issue of Single Point of Failure is no longer resolved through a de -
centralized network, since a large mining pool could compromise the integrity of the whole network. For example, a dishonest miner who has more than 50% of the total ability of the network to generate blocks may be able to successfully confirm fraudulent transactions. Another factor which would lead to further centralisation is the very low expected payoff to indi -

Lastly, there are economies of scale to mining – com -
panies specialising in mining can negotiate better rates 
with mining equipment producers and local electrici -
ty providers and can further benefit from locating and moving their activity depending on the current elec -
tricity market conditions. In this case, unregulated mining pools would grow to become fewer and fewer in number – as seen in Figure 21, there is already sig -
nificant degree of centralisation in mining.
The environment for natural monopolies to flourish has 
led the Bank of England to concluded as far back as 2014 that, “a significant risk to digital currencies’ sustained use as payment systems is therefore that they will not be able to compete on cost without degenerating — in the limiting case — to a monopoly miner, thereby de -
feating their original design goals and exposing them to risk of system-wide fraud.” (Ali, Barrdear, Clews and Southgate, 2014) (Ali et al, 2014, p.6).
Exclusion, abuse and mistrust
As discussed above, the centralisation of mining could 
lead to a situation where a few cooperating pools have more than 50% of a network’s hash-rate, in which case 
65
Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
In July 2014 the mining pool Ghash.io exceeded 50% 
of Bitcoin computational power. This is not the only option to break the honest mining assumption; an -
other possibility is collision between miners. In fact, there are different possible attack strategies, incen -
tives and condition in which the stability of the con -
sensus mechanism is in threat (Bahack, 2013; Garay, 2014; Sirer, 2014).
This possibility of miners, along with influential 
players altering and forcing specific rules on the Bit -
coin network challenges the assumptions of decen -
tralisation. Recently, the Bitcoin community wit -
nessed a panic by a suggestion of Binance CEO of “reorganizing the chain” after the exchange was hacked and lost $40 million in Bitcoin. 
Fortunately, influential actors advised not to go 
through with the idea in fear of losing trust in Bitcoin. This conclusion was the main argument of Nakamoto against the majority miner attack, where he argued that “in the long term, it is better to play by the rules”  (Nakamoto, 2008).   
Lower Fees
Despite not being classified as money, Bitcoin has succeeded in providing a cheap way of transferring large amounts of capital. While the transaction fees have changed significantly over time, on average it cost less than $1 to have a transaction settle on blockchain with an expected time of 10 minutes (one block). The challenge comes when we consider a net -
work for micropayments, as the blockchain fee is (ap -
proximately) fixed regardless of the value of the transaction. This makes day to day transactions us -
ing Bitcoin no cheaper than using a debt, a credit card or other third-party payment systems. There are plans to ramp up the speed and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions, which could help to bring down costs in the future. 
There also exist significant, and well-documented, 
electricity costs associated with Proof of Work frame -
works, requiring huge amounts computational power for a vast network of users, the scale of which was per -
haps not envisioned by Nakamoto in 2008. The electric -
ity requirements for solving blocks makes this a popular activity in countries with subsidized electricity such as  they could, as is the case with any centralised system, accept a double-spent transaction or abuse their power to censor certain transactions. Arguably, neither would be in their long-term interest, as in the end miners’ prof -
itability depends on the value of the network itself, espe -
cially in the case of Proof of Stake models, and their sunk costs (mining equipment and infrastructure) are heavily specialised and of little use for other tasks. However, this could work as a short term ‘get rich quick’ scheme where a conglomerate of miners could defraud the system and quickly sell all of their cryptocurrency gains for a more reliable type of money (or other financial asset). 66
Mongolia. This creates additional issues regarding the 
degree of centralised control for consortiums in a sup -
posedly decentralised network.
security and a nony Mity
–
For all practical purposes, Bitcoin provides ‘pseudo-an -
onymity’ only. As the history of all transactions is 
openly available, with sufficient investigative resourc -
es one can often statistically infer the identity of a person behind a public key.
15 There exist useful advan -
tages of cryptocurrencies in sending international transfers to countries where they would otherwise be seized by the banking system, as well as a store of value in countries with rampant inflation rates [see examples in Chapter 2]. There has been little evidence of governments in countries expending significant effort in curbing this activity.
Another important drawback of currencies that are 
anonymous and fully independent of state control relates back to the same arguments made by Sands (2016) and Rogoff (2017). If a given type of currency offers anonymity and the guarantee that nobody, in -
cluding law enforcement, would be able to access the record of transactions, it is very likely that criminals would use this for their financial transactions. In fact, from the perspective of those who wish to perform illegal activities, fully anonymous digital currencies are even better than cash. At least cash has a serial number in most countries, which helps to trace its path. Moreover, because of its physical nature, transferring large amounts of cash is a cumbersome activity that 
requires a lot of effort from criminals. With a non-track -
able digital form of money, illegal financial transac -
tions could be done instantly and on a global scale. 
A good example of how financial innovations in the 
field of currency can quickly become a tool for the daily financial routine of illegal activities is Liberty Reserves. Liberty Reserve was a company based in Costa Rica that allowed people to send and receive secure payments without revealing account numbers or real identities. This was done via the company’s private money, Liberty Reserves, which could be con -
verted into Euros and Dollars. The company started to operate in 2006 and, a few years later, in 2013 it was closed by the US government for being charged for money laundering and other financial crimes. In 2016, the founder of Liberty Reserve, Arthur Budovsky, pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit money laun -
dering and was sentenced to 20 years in jail. Examples like Liberty Reserves show us that the use of private -
ly issued currencies, with no state backing, will re -
quire some form of regulatory and law enforcement authority to ensure the legitimacy of its use. 
The good news is that cryptocurrencies in practice are 
not anonymous (as discussed in section B). The pseu -
do-anonymity of cryptocurrencies allows for easier tracking of transactions than is the case with cash. There exist costs to tracking transactions which means transactions, however, of average people will remain anonymous but law enforcement agencies can trace illegal activities. 
An excellent example come from Chainanalysis who 
enabled law enforcement in thirty-eight countries to make over 330 arrests of alleged pedophiles and rescue 23 children from abusive situations.

While the intention of Proof of Work consensus pro -
tocols like Bitcoin was to create a democratic decen -

With Proof of Stake, consensus protocol control re -
sides in the hands of those with the most tokens, whose interests may not match those of users in gen -
eral. The quasi-anonymity of these users also allows them to make decision without a very high degrees of transparency. While Proof of Stake ensures that all participants gain or lose from the network’s success or failure, there is opportunity for short-term gains with less transparency than is currently provided from traditional money managers like Central Banks and commercial banks. From a governance perspec -
tive, this could potentially be a step in the wrong direction when it comes to the democratization of money management. 
Because of the challenges for cryptocurrencies, as they 
currently exist to become viable widely used forms of money, it has been argued that “digital currencies do not currently serve a substantial role as money in so -68
ciety and,… face significant challenges to their wide -
spread use over the long run” (Ali et al, 2014, p.281). 
Given that consumers and businesses “already make 
retail payments electronically using debit and credit cards, payment applications, and the automated clear -
inghouse network” and “are finding easy ways to make digital payments directly to other people through a variety of mobile apps” (Brainard, 2018).
In summary, cryptocurrencies are struggling uphold 
their creator’s objectives. To date, no existing cryp -
tocurrency has been universally successful in fulfill -
ing the role of ‘money’. This is partly due to the technical issues raised throughout this chapter, and partly due to the fact that policymakers, academics and the general public have all held generally negative attitudes about the prospects of money being issued and managed in a decentralized framework and/or by private sector actors. From this perspective, central banks in most advanced economies have built a trust premium compared to private sector companies, which should make them better candidates for issuing money and managing/regulating financial transac -
tions. We will look at this more closely in Chapter 6 for the US, UK, Germany, France, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Spain.69

”The technical evidence from the previous chapter 
suggests that a Hayek-type digital currency has so far been unsuccessful in achieving achieve its cre -
ators’ intended purpose. The technology introduced by Nakamoto (2008), however, is still extremely valuable when it comes to improving money and, more importantly, its payment systems. This can be achieved by incorporating blockchain technology into existing institutions, mainly central banks. 71
Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
Central bank digital currency (CBDC) can be broadly 
defined as “any electronic, fiat liability of a central bank that can be used to settle payments, or as a store of value” (Barker et al, 2018, p.2). Note that, unlike the case of cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are considered a lia -
bility on the central bank’s balance sheet (see last part of Chapter 2) As will be demonstrated in the next sec -
tion, established central bank currencies have a signif -
icant advantage as a trusted form of money rather than an entirely new, and not well understood, option. Lagarde (2018) also argues that monetary authorities will continue to remain a pillar of trust given the breadth of work they do, not only issuing stable money but also regulating the financial and payment system. 
While providing greater access to digital forms of cur -
rency is not a new idea, 
17 it has recently gained traction 
given the debate about the role of monetary authorities 
in future currency and systems of payment. Even though it is issued by the same monetary authority, CBDC can be considered as a disruptive change to the existing sys -
tem of payments, which can be slow and tedious. For example, some international transactions can take sev -
eral days to pass through regulatory checks and clearing houses. The potential use of blockchain technology for improving the efficiency of money raises many questions about the role of central bank money, direct access to central bank liabilities and the structure of financial 
intermediation.
Some of the characteristics and advantages of a 
well-designed CBDC would include a practically cost -less medium of exchange where individuals could hold accounts directly with the central bank. This would allow the central bank to have an additional tool for conducting monetary policy, better information on potentially fraudulent activities and avoid intermedi -
ary costs associated with commercial bank lending, especially for lower-income households. CBDCs could also act as an interest-bearing risk-free store of value, with a rate of return in line with other risk-free assets such as short-term government securities. 
18 A well-de -
signed CBDC would also overcome the price stability issue that exists with most privately issued cryptocur -
rencies (with the exception of stablecoins) by actively managing the supply in line with an underlying basket of goods and services. 
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which 
works as central bank ‘hub’ for central banks, has spent a considerable amount of resources trying to under -
stand how monetary authorities across the globe are tackling this issue of cryptoassets. According to Carstens (2019), central banking committees based at the BIS identi fied two main varieties of CBDCs:
 ▷A wholesale CBDC that would be restricted to 
a limited group of users and used for in -
ter-bank payments and other settlement transactions;
 ▷A retail CBDC that would be widely accessible 
to everyone. This could be based either on digital tokens or on accounts.A.	principles	of	CBDCs
17.	See:	Tobin,	2018;	Brunner	and	m eltzer,	1971.
18.	See	Bordo	and	Levin,	2018.72
As noted above, an account-based CBDC could be implemented via accounts held directly at the central bank. 
Such an approach “would be reminiscent of the early years of central banking, when individuals and nonfinan -
cial firms held accounts at the Bank of England and the Sveriges Riksbank” (Bordo and Levin, 2018, p.7). The reason that these individual accounts were discontinued was largely due to the impractical technicalities involved with maintaining such a large volume of accounts. Given the new technology available to central banks, this barrier should no longer exist with the use of an integrated accounting system into the CBDC framework.  
There are clear differences between these types of CBDCs and cash. A CBDC in these forms would not necessar -
ily be anonymous. Moreover, unlike cash, it could pay or charge interest. Figure 22 presents the attributes of 
these of CBDCs and how they compare to the current forms of central bank money.

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
In terms of active and evolving re -
search agendas, the Bank of En -
gland was one of the precursors on 
studies regarding cryptocurrencies and CBDCs  (Kumhof and Noone 2018; Barker et al., 2018; Barrdear and Kumhof, 2016; Ali et al., 2014). The UK’s monetary authority first raised the possibility of a central bank-issued digital currency in their research agenda in 2015. Since then, the most complete work done by the Bank of England regarding CBDCs and their implications has been Kumhof and Noone (2018). The Sveriges Riksbank is also inves -
tigating whether an e-krona would provide the general public with continued access to central bank money and increase the resilience of the payment system (see Sking -
sley, 2016; Riksbank, 2017). Other than the British and Swedish mon -
etary authorities, several central banks are also developing new re -
search agendas for CBDCs. These include the National Bank of Den -
mark (Gurtler et al., 2017, the Re -
serve Bank of Australia (Lowe (2017), the Bank of Canada (Engert et al., 2017) and many others. The Committee on Payments and Mar -
kets Infrastructures (CPMI) at the BIS did a survey in 2018 with central banks to understand the current B.	Current	State	of 	
cbdc s
stage of their work on CBDCs and what were their conclusions regarding this topic. More than 60 central bankers participated, representing coun -
tries that count for 80% of the world population.
Figure 23 presents the results of this survey. Seventy percent of central 
banks are working on some sort of CBDC. Nevertheless, only about half of the central banks doing work on CBDCs have actually moved toward testing this idea. According to BIS CPMI’s report, this means that central banks are examining the bene fits, risks and challenges of potential issu -
ance from a conceptual perspective. Only approximately a tenth of the central banks engaged with CBDCs have moved into the phase of exper -
imenting with the different types of possible technologies, by developing pilot arrangements.74
Figure 24 shows the answers of cen -
tral bankers when asked if they plan 
to issue a CBDC in the short or me -
dium term. Only a very small amount of these think they are likely to issue a CBDC in the short to medium term. The results are basically the same for retail and wholesale CBDC.
But why have central banks chosen 
not to provide these digital services? The reason for this lies in probably the most important question regard -
ing the discussion of CBDCs, the impact that the implementation of such currency would have in the financial and monetary systems. 
Many studies have been made by academics, monetary institutions, and even practitioners in trying to analyse these possible effects. In fact, most of the literature regarding CBDCs has focused on this topic.

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
In the current fractional reserve system, only commer -
cial banks have access to digital account-based central 
bank money. By contrast, physical central bank money (i.e. cash) is widely accessible to the general public. As discussed in the previously section, the use of cash will likely diminish as businesses adopt more hygienic and efficient forms of payment. With this possibility, the public would no longer have wide access to central bank money (bank notes), which would need to be replaced with a digital alternative. 
If household and business deposits are concentrated 
in the central bank, CBDC schemes would implicitly end the practice of, and risks associated with, fraction -
al reserve banking. This ‘narrowing’ of the banking system (depositors deal directly with the central bank) is effectively a revival of the ‘Chicago Plan’ as discussed in Chapter 2. 
19 
In addition to more efficient and safer payments and settlement systems, a CBDC could come with addi -
tional bene fits. Given that CBDC can allow for digi -
tal records and tracing, it could improve the appli -
cation of rules aimed at anti-money laundering and countering financial terrorism. Moreover, it would 
also possibly help to reduce informal economic ac -
tivities. Finally, Lagarde (2018), Coeur and Loh (2018), Broadbent (2016) and many others defend CBDCs as an important tool for financial inclusion, 
particularly in developing countries, where a signi fi-
cant part of the population is still not included in formal fi nancial systems.C.	Impact	of	CBDCs

From a central banker perspective, a CBDC could allow 
for real-time data on economic activity. Mersch (2017) argues that another bene fit from establishing such a 
CBDC would be to create a direct link between the pop -
ulation and the central bank, hence developing a better understanding of the role of a central bank and the need for such an institution to be independent.
Monetary p olicy
–
The consequences of CBDC issuance for the implemen -
tation and transmission of monetary policy depend on 
how wide access to CBDC is and whether it is attrac -
tively remunerated. Monetary policy arguments for issuing CBDC include strengthening of the pass-through mechanism of the policy rate to money mar -
kets and deposit rates, potentially making negative rates a more effective tool in boosting economic activ -
ity. Such a change, however, could also bring new risks to monetary policy.Monetary policy implications are likely to be more pro -
nounced if a CBDC emerges as an attractive asset to hold. According to Coeur and Loh (2018), if a CBDC is set as a new and liquid central bank liability, it is likely to have an impact in the channels of transmission of policy rates to money markets and beyond. Given the high demand for low-risk government-issued assets over the last decade, a CBDC would be likely to affect holdings by investors, particularly in markets for liquid, low-risk instruments (such as government bonds). If institutional investors could hold CBDCs without lim -
its, the interest rate on these would help to establish a hard floor under money market rates, as this financial 
instrument would be the government bond with short -
est (instant) duration. 
Regarding households, if a CBDC is implemented in 
such a way that it becomes a viable alternative to com -
mercial bank deposits, it would be able to make the rates on these deposits more linked to what the central bank would pay on its digital currency. As a result, this is likely to strength the pass-through mechanism of the policy rate to the general public.
Since the 2008 crisis, developed markets have dived 
into negative rate territories. As we currently stand in 2019, it does not seem like we are surfacing anytime soon. In fact, more recently, interest rates in emerging economies are also converting to historical lows. With even the monetary authorities of emerging markets starting to discuss the possibility of negative interest rates for government bonds, a tool to pass these rates to money markets and deposit rates would be welcomed by central banks. 
In the fractional reserve banking system that we have, 
monetary authorities are able to charge negative rates on bonds and deposits that financial institutions hold at the central banks. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the monetary stimulus of setting negative rates is limited. Financial institutions cannot pass these rates to client’s deposits, since they always have the option of holding cash, which yields a non-negative rate. If monetary au -
thorities were to replace cash by an interest-bearing CBDC, this would open the possibility of expanding negative yields to accounts of households and firms in the real economy, hence increasing the effectiveness of negative interest rates. In fact, Goodfriend (2016) and It	is	difficult	to	draw 	
definitive	or	quantitatively-
robust conclusions about 
the	impact	of	CBDC	on	the 	
monetary transmission 
mechanism,	due	to	the 	
large	degree	of 	
uncertainty around the ultimate	design	of	CBDC, 	
the economic environment

and the structural changes that may accompany it.
– Barker et al., 2018.“

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
Dyson and Hodgson (2016) argue that the issuance of 
CBDCs could alleviate the pressure on the zero lower bound even if physical cash was not extinct, as long as it came along with a reduced desire for cash holding. 
As it currently stands, however, the dependence of key 
market rates on the policy rate seems to be satisfactory to most central bankers (Coeur and Loh, 2018). Even though these are not perfectly correlated, this does not represent a challenge as long as central banks have enough control over the fi nancial system and its institutions. 
Regarding the effectiveness of CBDC as a tool to impose negative interest rates on the general public, it is un -
certain how this would work in practice. General equi -
librium effects may make the implementation of such strategy unfeasible even with digital currencies. There is no guarantee that society would accept a negative yielding currency to be “imposed” by central banks. By trying to set negative interest rates more broadly, mon -etary authorities could in fact cause the demise of na -
tional fiat money, as people could escape to non-nega -
tive yielding competitors, like commodity money or even cryptocurrency alternatives.
The overall effects of CBDC on the term structure of 
interest rates are very hard to predict and will depend on many factors. More generally, the implications of a CBDC relative to other instruments are likely to depend on each jurisdiction’s speci fic operating environment. 
Also, since operating environments may change in the future, monetary policy cost-bene fit analyses related 
to CBDCs may need to be revisited periodically.
Finally, weaker demand for cash does not imply the need 
for CBDCs. In fact, monetary policy can remain effective even without cash. 
20	On balance, the study from Coeur 
and Loh (2018) argues that it is not clear that there is a strong basis at this time to issue a CBDC for the purpose of enhancing the efficacy of monetary policy.

Financial s tability
–
Implementing a CBDC would almost certainly imply in 
a more active role for central banks in financial inter -
mediation. This would not, however, necessarily mean more financial stability. One example is that by having 
to passively accommodate the demand for CBDC, the central bank could potentially introduce a high level of volatility in the demand for government debt.
A general purpose CBDC could have a large impact on 
the structure of fi nancial intermediation and the activ -
ity of traditional banks. If this digital currency is attrac -
tive to individuals and firms, it could result in a with -
drawal of funding to commercial banks. This could lead some banks to raise spreads and increase transaction fees in order to maintain pro fitability. Depending on 
how the financial system is organized, banks might have 
to shrink their balance sheets, with possible adverse economic consequences.
Arguably, the most signi ficant and plausible fi nancial 
stability risk of a general purpose CBDC is that it can 
facilitate a flight away from private financial institu -
tions and markets towards the central bank. Faced with systemic financial stress, households and other agents 
in both advanced and emerging market economies tend to suddenly shift their deposits towards financial in -
stitutions perceived to be safer and/or into government securities. Of course, agents can already shift funds towards the central bank by holding more cash. But a CBDC could allow for digital runs towards the central bank with unprecedented speed and scale. Even in the presence of deposit insurance, the stability of retail funding could weaken because a risk-free CBDC pro -
vides a very safe alternative.
The central bank could try to manage the interest rate 
on this CBDC in order to control such runs. Neverthe -
less, changes on this rate, even towards a negative territory, may be unsuccessful in periods of economic turmoil when agents seek safety at almost any price. Another solution could be to impose quantitative limits on the amount of CBDC that each individual or firm 
could hold. But this would most likely result in price differences between different types of money, in con -
tradiction to the principle of money being exchangeable at par and hampering the conduct of monetary policy.Overall, one can notice that a lot of the questions raised by the issuance of CBDC are very similar to the points once discussed by those who advocated for full-reserve banking. Back then, those who de -
fended a narrower banking system - famously Fish -
er (1936) in what became known as the “Chicago Plan” - advocated that such a setting could make the overall fi nancial system safer because it would lim -
it the ability of the private banks to create money and exacerbate business cycles.
Although narrow banking raises many questions in 
its own right, the introduction of a CBDC does not necessarily entail the same restrictions of a full-re -
serve banking system. In fact, the term is used in a general way, but each monetary authority could issue a digital currency and model payment systems tai -
lored to the necessities and idiosyncrasies of the local economy, while considering the cross-border and global dimension of this CBDC. 79

ness to own that type of money. We will provide a demonstration and discuss the results in the second part of this chapter.      it can be plausibly argued

–  Arrow, 1972.
A key theme throughout this report is the importance of 
trust in maintaining a successful fiat currency. This trust has traditionally been vested in public institutions (cen -
tral bank), but digital methods of payment performed by private companies have successfully existed for many years (credit cards, debit cards, etc.). A more recent ex -
ample can be found in Kenya where a recent study by Kaminska found that M-Pesa “appears to have succeeded because Safaricom, which is 40% owned by the multina -
tional giant Vodaphone, is trusted by the public more than the Kenyan banking system” (Kaminska, 2015). She notes, however, that that “M-Pesa really resembles a money transmission service more than a standalone currency, since its sponsor collateralizes units of M-Pesa with Kenyan hard currency deposits in escrow accounts” (Kaminska, 2015). In this case, central banks remain responsible for the creation and management of narrow money, but the private sector takes over when it comes to system of payments (transacting with money).”“81
Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
At present, there is limited general public understand -
ing of how money is created:
New results from the IE Survey on ‘The Future of Mon -
ey’ suggest, unsurprisingly, that the majority of respon -
dents are either, not familiar with fractional reserve 
banking (between 44 and 75%), or, are familiar with it but not sure what it means (between 17 and 43%). In -
terestingly, the US and UK rank amongst the lowest in terms of understanding fractional reserve banking with around half of the degree of understanding in Germany.  
In a 2012 UK Government Office for Science research 
paper, Dr Y.V. Reddy, (former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India) was quoted saying that: “Trust is difficult to measure, but on the basis of surveys conducted and anecdotes reported in the media, there appears to be an erosion of trust in the financial sector as a whole, and banking in particular, in advanced economies”.

is continued evidence of this erosion of trust over ten 
years after the financial crisis. For example a 2018 You -
Gov poll of 2,250 adults on behalf of campaign group Positive Money found 66% of adults in Britain do not trust commercial banks to work in the best interests of society, with only 20% stating that they do trust banks to work in the best interest of society (White, 2018).
Part of this lack of trust may come from people’s 
attitudes toward the government’s regulatory re -
sponse to the financial crisis. From Figure 26, we can see that many respondents in our survey felt that government has not taken meaningful steps in reg -
ulating the banking sector since 2008. From the above figure we can see that there is considerable amount of  variation with the majority of respon -
dents in Argentina, Spain, Germany, Mexico and France believing that government has not taken meaningful steps in regulating the banking sector since 2008. In Brazil and the UK, a slight majority believe that government has taken meaningful steps, while Americans were split 35%–35%.FIgure	26

Given the high levels of dissatisfaction with govern -
ment response to the financial crisis, we asked those 
respondents who answered ‘no’ to the previous ques -
tion to identify why they feel that government has not taken meaningful steps. From Figure 27, it appears that the majority of respondents in almost all countries in our sample felt that it is an important issue for voters in their countries, but lobbying exerts too much influ -
ence on government for any meaningful changes to take place’. Interestingly, the two financial centres of the world (along with Spain) had the highest levels of agreement that government was overly influenced by lobbying efforts.  
This continued erosion of trust and lack of effective 
government response may contribute to an increasing willingness for people to adopt alternative ways to store money. For example, a 2018 Bain survey of 151,894 consumers in 29 countries found that 29% of respon -
dents trust at least one tech company more than their primary bank and 54% of respondents trust at least one tech company more than banks in general (Bradley et al., 2018). Source: CGC, Cryptocurrencies and The Future of Money:

Despite people’s movement towards private third-party payment systems, our survey results suggest that they 
still prefer that central banks create and manage money. From Figure 29 we can see that the majority of respon -
dents (between 65% and 89%) in all of the countries in our sample trust central banks and commercial banks to create and manage money (as their first/second choice). Specifically, central banks are the most trusted across all countries and commercial banks, with the exception of Germany, which prefers the central government to com -
mercial banks, are the second choice for respondents. In the case of Mexico, the central bank and commercial banks have fairly equal levels of trust, while the government has incredibly low levels of trust.

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
As discussed in the previous section, cryptocurrencies 
have not yet manifested themselves as intended by their creators, mainly, as useful form of money, relative to other already established options (physical and digital). This does not mean that cryptocurrenices will not be -
come slowly integrated into societies as their infrastruc -
ture improves. For example, Facebook’s Libra aims to widen access to financial services and lower transaction costs while ensuring the value of the coin by being ful -
ly backed by ‘low-volatility assets, including bank de -
posits and government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks’. Holders of Libra will not be paid interest that the underlying assets generate – the cashflow will be used for the Foundation. The presence of negative interest rates on some of the un -
derlying assets may force the foundation to rebalance their holdings to avoid passing a loss on to their cus -
tomers or to pass on these costs to owners of that cur -
rency. Banking system may well ride on the back of it – not unlike the existent repo-based shadow-banking system in Bitcoin. The blockchain starts as permis -
sioned, with a prospect of being permissionless – again, it is unclear why the founding partners (i.e. the ‘permis -
sioned’ parties) would choose to give up this privilege in the future. 
To get an idea of willingness to use an effective crypto -
currency (one that fulfils all of the requirements of a 
successul form of money), we asked respondents about their willingness to use this type of money if issued by a private company.                                                      FIgure	34

Suppose that a new cryptocurrency was designed by a private company (or group of companies)  that could be used to make all of your day-to-day transactions (it is accepted by all sellers) and has a stable value over time (low inflation/deflation). This currency could also be con -
verted to other currencies at a very small cost. Would you prefer to use this currency over your current method of payment?

hypothetical cryptocurrency was a lack of trust in new currencies.  In the case of the US and UK, respondents felt that cryptocurrencies do not offer any advantages over the money they already use. 
The recent high profile announcement of Facebook’s Libra has led to a variety of surveys and articles written on 
its viability in terms of consumers’ willingness to trust it.  The results have not been overly positive. For example, a June 2019 Viber survey of 1,000 US and 1,000 UK residents found that nearly half of respondents in both countries (49%) say they would not trust Facebook at all, and less that 3% and 2% of US and UK respondents, respectively, said they would be willing to try Libra for payments (Viber, 2018).Source: CGC, Cryptocurrencies and The

Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
Another July, 2019 CivicScience survey of 1,799 American adults found that 40% of respondents claimed that they 
trusted Libra less (35% much less) than Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Only around 2% of all respondents claimed that they trusted Libra more than other more established cryptocurrencies.                                             
This sentiment is similar in Germany where a July 2019 German citizen’s movement survey of 2,093 adult residents 
found that 71% of respondents were sceptical about Libra with only 12% claiming they would welcome it (Fi -
nanzwende, 2019).To gain a broader understanding of people’s trust in the Libra across a wider range of countries, we asked 1,000 respondents in each of the eight countries in our sample whether they would trust Facebook to issue and man -
age a new cryptocurrency. The results widely vary across countries. 
In Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil, there is a much higher willingness to trust a new Facebook issued currency with over 
40% of Mexico residents saying they would trust the Libra. In contrast to these three countries, residents of Germany, the UK, US, and France were much less willing to trust the Libra with only between 3 and 6% saying they would trust the Libra.

conJoint analysis
–
To gain a deeper understanding of what people want in an ideal currency, we provided 1,000 survey respondents 
in each of the eight countries in our sample, with ten frames, each of which provided them with a choice between three hypothetical currencies with varying attributes. For the purpose of this exercise, we characterized ‘money’ as having five underlying attributes:
Issuer/backer  refers to who issues and/or backs that currency. This could be a central bank, a commer -
cial bank (private sector company), or a peer-to-peer nonprofit like Bitcoin (private sector peer to peer).
Acceptability  refers to where are able you use the currency. Is your currency accepted by all sellers of 
goods/services or only some sellers of goods/services (within the area in which you buy/sell goods and 
services)?
Transaction  costs  are there costs involved in making the transaction (these are commonly known as 
‘fees’, ‘premiums’ or ‘spreads’).  Price  Stability  refers to the expected change in the amount of goods and/or services you can buy over 
the course of a month with the same amount of currency (i.e. x$ in October will be worth y$ in Novem-
ber)
Digital/physical . All currency that is stored outside of your personal physical possession can be con -
sidered as digital.

Attributes	and	Attribute	o ptions	for	types	of	Money
This produced 80,000 observations reflecting the pref -
erences of residents in Argentina, Brazil, France, Ger -
many, Mexico, Spain, the US and UK, for money across 
our five attributes. The most straightforward way to interpret the results is by examining the average mar -
ginal effects of each attribute choice. Effectively, these can be viewed as premiums/discounts placed on spe -
cific characteristics of money that are comparable with each other in magnitudes. The results are shown in Figure 38 for each country separately. The general results are consistent with the findings throughout this report. 
Mainly, respondents place a significant premium on 
money created by central banks, with the least pre -
ferred option being peer-to-peer. The magnitudes vary quite a bit across countries with Germany plac -
ing a very large premium on central bank money (0.18) and Mexico placing a lower premium on central bank money (0.04). Acceptability had a relatively consistent impact across all countries with American respon -dents placing the largest discount on low-acceptabil -
ity types of money. Transaction cost effects were also fairly consistent across countries with significant aversions when moving from 0% to between 0.1 and 1%, but only slightly higher aversion rates when mov -
ing from 0.1 and 1% to between 1 and 10% of the transaction costs. With respect to inflation, it appears that while respondents certainly prefer no inflation/deflation, they are much more comfortable in the 0.1-10% range that beyond that. This is especially true in the case of Argentina (-.023 compared with no infla -
tion). Interestingly, the results for digital vs. physical money were mixed across countries. In Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, respondents preferred digital mon -
ey to physical money. While the magnitudes were not large (between 0.02 and 0.04) there were statistical -
ly significant. In Spain, France, Germany, the UK, and US, respondents still marginally preferred to own physical cash over digital money. Again, the magni -
tudes here were not large compared with other attri -
butes but were statistically significant.   FIgure	38.	Attributes	of	Money	Conjoint	Analysis	r esults95
Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
Thinking about these results in the context of current 
types of money, cash, credit cards, and debit cards, all have very high levels of acceptability and relative -
ly low transaction costs in most advanced economies. Central banks with a history of stable inflation and/or a reputation as trustworthy creators and managers of money lead to the expectation of low levels of in -
flation with cash, credit cards and debit cards. Over -
all, these three highly used types of money score quite highly in the context of our conjoint analysis. Exist -
ing cryptocurrencies, however have low levels of ac -ceptability and large price fluctuations, which are two of the least-desired characteristics of money. As noted above, these is also a trust premium enjoyed by central banks, creating an additional trust barrier for the much less preferred alternatives, including Face -
book. In general, the results suggest that cryptocur -
rencies, especially those which are privately issued, have a long way to go before they might be able to compete with or overtake traditional forms of money like cash, credit cards and debit cards backed by cen -
tral and commercial banks.   
96
conclusion
Over the past ten years, attention to money and the fi -
nancial systems has come under greater scrutiny by a 
wider public concerned with current levels of transpar -
ency, management, accountability and fairness.  Accom -
panying this scrutiny is an era of unprecedented techno -
logical innovations that open up the range of possibilities for how money works, some of which were proposed by Austrian School economists in the early 20th century. Destabilisations in financial markets often lead to short revivals of these Austrian school ideas regarding the role of money and banking in society making it no coincidence that the Nakamoto (2008) paper emerged in the after -
math of the 2007/08 financial crisis. 
The widespread distrust arising from the financial crisis 
and greater public scrutiny led to the seminal contribu -
tion from Nakamoto (2008) and subsequent invention of Bitcoin. The decentralized nature and democratic consensus protocol of Bitcoin was envisioned to become a digital payment system with emphasis on removing the need for a trusted third-party institution in process -
ing transactions, whose rules are enforced by consensus, with anyone being able to participate. There are other good reasons to move from cash to blockchains based electronic payment systems including the elimination of a sourse of illicit financial activity, public health ben -
efits and overall efficiency of not having to be physical -
ly present to make very fast transactions with strangers. In fact, digital payment systems have been slowly re -
placing physical cash for many years with the majority of respondents to the IE Survey on the Future of Money using credit cards and debit cards as frequently as cash. Several other digital alternatives to physical cash have already become successful systems of payments (M-Pe -
sa, AliPay, Paypal, etc.). 97
Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Money
Unfortunately, in practice, cryptocurrencies are strug -
gling to uphold their creator’s objectives, given that no 
existing cryptocurrency has been universally success -
ful in fulfilling the role of ‘money’. This is partly due to the failure in practice for a decentralized system to work in the presence of large mining consortiums, a lack of price stability, high transaction costs with large electricity consumption (with Proof of Work consensus protocols) and, potentially lower degrees of transparent governance. There also exists a general distrust of new currencies issued by new institutions. While central banks are not perfect, in most advanced economies they have built a trust premium compared to private sector companies, which makes them better candidates in the opinion of most citizens for issuing money and man -
aging/regulating financial transactions.
These trust premiums and low levels of trust and under -
standing of cryptocurrencies are confirmed by the unique 
results from the IE Survey on the Future of Money. Specifi -
cally, residents of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, France, Ger -
many, Spain, the UK and USA all i) place significant premi -
ums on money which is issued by a traditional authority (preferably central banks), ii) place a heavy discount on currencies which lack price stability, and, iii) place a high premium on money that is highly accepted. Based on these results and the technical challenges listed in Chapter 4, cryptocurrencies have a considerable amount of obstacles to overcome before gaining widespread acceptance by gen -
eral public. The good news is that central banks are current -
ly working diligently to investigate/establish Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) which would overcome some of the challenges associated with cash while still being man -
aged by a trustworthy central authority in the case of ad -
vanced economies. Where central banks have poor records of money issuance and management or high degrees of exclusion abuse and mistrust, such countries could benefit in the short term from the introduction of a privately issued cryptocurrency, especially with the vast increase in world -
wide Internet users and availability of secure servers. 
In short, we can return to the conclusion from Lawson in 
Chapter 1: “The challenge, then, for those seeking to ren -
der a form(s) of cryptocurrency as money lies both in getting it positioned as a legitimate general means of payment (governed by relevant rights and obligations to ensure this) and so also trusted in the sense that if posi -
tioned as money it would serve as a store of liquid value.”List	of	Figures

I	try	to	answer	all	questions	about	Forex	trading.	If	you	are	new	to	trading	or	you	traded	stocks	and	want	to	learn	more	about	Forex	trading,	then	this	guide	is	for	you.	The	goal	of	this	guide	is	to	give	you	practice	knowledge	so	you	can	understand	Forex	trading	basics	and	trade	by	yourself.	If	you	don’t	understand	some	terms,	go	to	sites	like	Investopedia,	they	covered	all	terms	like	margin,	pip	and	many	others.						Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	4		PART	1.			How	to	understand	forex	trading	When	you	trade	stocks,	you	can	select	how	many	stocks	you	want	to	buy	or	sell	(if	you	plan	to	go	short).	With	Forex	you	are	trading	a	currency.	You	can’t	select	that	you	want	to	sell	7523	euros.	Starting	point	is	1	lot	which	is	100,000	units	of	base	currency.			1	lot	for	EUR/USD	=	100,000	euros	2	lots	for	EUR/USD	=	200,000	euros	0.1	lot	for	EUR/USD	=	10,000	euros		That	way	you	can	decide	how	much	base	currency	you	want	to	invest.	Of	course,	you	do	not	have	to	have	all	that	money	in	your	account.	Thanks	to	leverage	you	have	only	split	of	that	amount.		In	Forex,	minimal	movement	is	one	pip.	For	standard	basic	1	lot	(100,000	units)	move	of	1	pip	is	equal	to	10$	change.			Why	people	are	losing	money	in	Forex	It	is	because	they	do	not	understand	leverage.	It	is	very	powerful,	yet	very	dangerous	perk	that	you	get	when	you	decide	to	trade	Forex.	With	only	few	hundred	dollars	you	can	open	positions	which	are	as	big	as	100,000	dollars	or	euros	and	larger.	When	you	are	right	in	your	trade,	then	you	make	good	money.	When	you	are	wrong…	well,	you	can	be	out	of	funds	very	soon.		That	is	why	new	traders	should	start	from	lower	sizes	–	micro	lots	or	even	nano	lots.	This	is	similar	to	stock	market.	It	is	a	bad	idea	to	start	investing	in	stock	market	and	learn	how	to	invest	with	real	100,000	or	500,000$.	The	risk	is	too	big.	It	is	easier	to	learn	on	smaller	capital.	Same	is	with	Forex.	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	5		Start	small	–	Nano,	micro	lots	You	won’t	get	rich	fast	by	trading	micro	and	nano	lots,	but	thanks	to	them	you	will	stay	in	the	game	and	you	will	have	opportunity	to	learn	from	live	trading.	The	reason	why	so	many	traders	lose	all	their	money	in	the	Forex	is	because:	• their	trading	capital	is	too	small		• they	open	too	big	positions,	because	they	do	not	understand	leverage		So	yeah,	it	is	like	in	many	ads	you	could	see	in	the	past	–	“you	can	open	account	with	just	100$.	Leverage	even	1:500”.	In	the	end,	you	need	one	or	few	positions	of	1	lot	size	to	blow	up	your	account.	You	should	remember	that	1	lot	is	a	base	for	calculating	size	of	your	position.	1	lot	=	100,000	units	of	a	currency	In	MetaTrader4	it	will	be	on	select	list	like:	
	
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	6		If	you	open	short	on	EUR/USD	of	size	2	lots	you	will	be	shorting	200,000	euros.	One	pip	will	be	around	20$.	Magic	of	leverage	(and	the	curse	same	time…).	There	are	also	smaller	base	sizes	like:	1	mini	lot	(0.1)	=	10,000	units	of	base	currency		If	you	open	long	position	on	EUR/USD	of	size	0.1	then	you	will	be	long	with	10.000	euro.	In	MetaTrader4	it	will	be	as	Volume	list	like:	• 0.1	(one	mini	lot)		• 0.2	(two	mini	lots)		• 0.3	…		One	pip	will	be	here	around	1	euro.		1	micro	lot	(0.01)	=	1000	units	of	base	currency	In	MetaTrader4	it	will	be	as	Volume	list	like:	• 0.01	(one	micro	lot)		• 0.02	(two	micro	lots)		• 0.03	(three	micro	lots)		• …		Going	long	with	0.01	lot	on	EUR/USD	means	that	you	are	long	1000	euros.	One	pip	is	here	around	0.1	euro.	1	nano	lot	(0.001)	=	100	units	of	base	currency	In	MetaTrader4	it	will	be	on	select	list	like:	• 0.001	(one	nano	lot)		• 0.002	(two	nano	lots)		• …		Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	7		Not	every	broker	offer	trade	sizes	as	small	as	nano	lots	or	micro	lots.	You	should	check	it	first	in	the	offer.	Trading	sizes	are	simple.	First	you	may	get	confused,	because	it	is	different	than	trade	sizes	 in	 stock	 trading.	 Try	 to	 do	 some	 operations	 on	 demo	 account,	 try	 different	position	sizes	and	you	will	understand	quickly	what	it	is	all	about	with	nano,	micro,	mini	and	full	lots.			How	can	I	start	Forex	trading?	Ok,	you	want	to	become	a	currency	trader.	You’ve	read	about	pips,	leverage	and	all	that	Forex	trading.	It	is	time	to	start	practice.	You	are	in	luck,	today	it	is	very	easy	to	start	Forex	trading.	Select	a	Forex	Broker	To	start	trading	forex,	you	need	a	Forex	broker.	There	are	many	brokers	and	for	new	trader	it	may	be	hard	to	choose	the	best	one.	Remember,	most	of	them	offer	a	demo	account,	 where	 you	 can	 test	 their	 trading	 platform.	 You	 can	 start	 with	 our	Forex	brokers	section.		Usually,	registration	is	quick,	you	need	only	some	recent	bills	to	prove	your	address	is	valid.	That’s	it.		If	you	look	at	Forex	broker	offer,	make	sure	that	he	allows	to	trade	with	lower	sizes	such	as	nano	or	at	least	micro.		Install	trading	software	OK,	with	selected	broker	you	need	to	install	trading	software.	This	will	be	MetaTrader4	platform	or	other	custom	platform	from	broker.	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	8		Some	 brokers	 use	 their	 own	 trading	 platform	 like	 eTorro.	 Of	 course	 every	 custom	platform	is	best	in	the	world	;).	There	are	brokers	who	only	have	their	own	platform	and	they	do	not	offer	Metatrader	platform.	I	don’t	know	why,	but	some	very	well-known	brans	miss	MT4	in	offer.			The		big	advantage	of	Metatrader	is	that	you	have	many	custom	indicators,	expert	advisors.	It	is	a	good	platform	overall	and	I	recommend	brokers	who	offer	MT4.	Trading	from	Mac	MetaTrader	 is	 a	 Windows	 application.	 If	 you	 have	 a	 Mac	 computer	 with	 Mac	 OS	 X	system,	then	you	must	use	software	like	Wine	to	run	MetaTrader	4.	Some	brokers	like	XM	or	HotForex	offer	Metatrader	for	Mac	Os	X	and	they	work	very	good.	You	don’t	need	wine,	setup	is	very	quick.	I	tested	Metatrader	platforms	from	XM	and	HotForex	on	my	Mac	and	they	worked	fine.	Below	screen	of	demo	MT4	platform	from	XM,	running	on	MAC	OS	X:	
	It's	all	the	same	as	on	Windows	machine.	
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	9		Fund	your	Forex	account	When	you	have	registered	an	account,	you	can	add	funds.	It	is	very	easy.	You	can	start	with	 few	 hundred	 dollars	 on	 mini	 account.	 Minimum	 amount	 is	 different	 for	 each	broker.		Test	platform	on	demo	Before	you	decide	to	open	real	account,	test	a	platform	on	demo	(especially	if	you	are	new	to	Forex	trading).	You	will	have	some	virtual	10k	or	100k	to	play	with	on	demo.	Test	how	order	placing	works,	how	to	place	stop	loss	etc.	You	do	not	want	to	learn	these	things	with	your	real	cash.					Practice	forex	trading	–	demo	accounts		It	is	hard	to	make	profit	in	Forex	that	is	why	practice	is	so	important.	You	have	now	many	options	to	practice	your	trading	skills	and	learn	to	trade.		OK,	but	what	is	best?	Do	you	need	trading	simulator?	Paper	trading	is	a	good	way	to	start	–	not	real	paper	but	with	help	of	demo	account	of	course.	We	talk	about	paper	trading	when	you	are	trading	with	virtual	money.	Years	before	simulators	you	simply	put	trades	on	a	piece	of	paper.	When	you	felt	ready	to	trade	on	real	 account,	 you	 made	 a	 switch.	 In	 1930’s	 it	 wasn’t	 that	 easy	 to	 open	 brokerage	account,	besides	fees	for	opening	and	closing	trades	were	also	high.	Paper	trades	were	good	solution	–	you	could	learn	how	to	trade	without	losing	real	money.		Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	10		Demo	trading	in	Forex	Now	 when	 we	 are	 talking	 about	 paper	 trading,	 we	 mean	 trading	 on	 simulators.	 Of	course,	you	can	use	pencil	and	paper,	but	trading	on	simulator	is	much	better	way	to	go.	You	can	easily	open	a	demo	account	and	get	access	to	trading	platform	so	you	can	test	it.	Your	demo	account	is	funded	with	virtual	money	and	you	can	place	orders.		The	main	advantages	of	Forex	demo	trading	• you	do	not	put	at	risk	real	money	–	yours	loses	and	gains	are	virtual,	so	there	is	no	risk	that	you	will	lose	all	you	trading	capital		• you	can	test	your	trading	system	and	different	trading	strategies		• you	can	see	how	to	use	leverage		• if	you	are	using	mechanical	system,	you	can	test	it	in	practice		The	main	disadvantages	of	demo	trading	• you	do	not	put	at	risk	real	money	–	you	react	different	when	it	is	real	money	you	are	losing		• you	make	trades	that	you	normally	wouldn’t	make	with	real	money			Is	paper	trading	a	good	way	to	learn	how	to	trade?		Generally,	yes.	If	trading	Forex	is	something	new	for	you	or	you	want	to	test	totally	new	strategy	then	yes,	it	is	ok.		I	would	say	that	demo	trading	is	very	important	when	you	want	to	start	trade	on	Forex.	As	you	know,	on	currency	market	we	use	leverage.	There	are	different	position	sizes.	The	basic	one	is	1	lot.	You	can	open	position	as	big	as	couple	lots	(for	example	5	lots),	or	position	smaller	then	1	lot	–	this	will	be	micro	lot	or	nano	lot.	If	it	sounds	not	familiar,	then	you	have	to	test	it	on	demo	account.	Thing	is,	with	leverage	it	is	very	easy	to	blew	whole	account	in	matters	of	few	minutes.	It	is	crucial	to	master	how	to	manage	position	size	and	understand	well	how	it	works.	Leverage	can	be	your	best	friend	or	the	worst	enemy.	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	11		When	you	are	building	mechanical	trading	system,	then	it	is	also	great	possibility	to	test	it	on	demo	account.	So	again,	demo	trading	in	that	case	is	not	that	bad.		In	a	long	term,	demo	trading	is	not	the	way	to	learn	how	to	trade.	You	should	switch	to	real	account	with	small	funds.	Why?	Because	of…	Trading	and	psychology	When	 you	 are	 on	 demo	 and	 you	 switch	 to	 real	 money	 trading,	 you	 will	 notice	difference.	Now	you	care.	When	you	are	losing	money,	you	feel	fear.	You	hesitate	to	close	losing	position	“because	it	may	turn	around”	(yeah,	it	always	does	;)	).	When	your	trade	is	in	profit,	you	are	greedy.	You	hesitate	to	close	position,	because	it	may	go	even	higher.	Hell,	this	may	be	a	trade	of	your	life.		This	kind	of	emotions	occurs	only	when	you	are	trading	with	real	money.	You	will	learn	over	time	that	most	of	your	loses	come	from	not	following	trading	plan	and	allowing	emotions	to	play	too	big	role	in	your	decision	making	process.		You	are	not	able	to	switch	off	your	emotions.	On	the	other	hand,	you	must	be	aware	of	them	and	not	allow	to	take	control.	That	is	why	you	need	to	have	your	trading	plan	on	paper.	Write	down	as	many	things	you	can	in	your	trading	plan	–	that	way	you	will	minimize	impact	of	emotions	in	your	trading.		Ok,	so	let’s	see	where	demo	trading	is	in	trader	education	process.			Demo	trading	in	trader	learning	process	1.	Open	demo	account	2.	Build	strategy	and	trading	plan	3.	Test	different	position	sizes	–	add	to	trading	plan	size	of	positions.	Test	different	currency	pairs,	different	time	frames.	4.	Test	your	trading	plan	–	set	goals	such	as	do	not	lose	money	in	next	3	months	etc.		When	you	are	profitable	on	demo…	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	12		5.	Open	real	account	6.	Fund	account	with	money	you	can	afford	to	lose	7.	Set	realistic	goals	and	trade	according	to	your	trading	plan	8.	Trade	smaller	positions!	When	you	are	profitable…	9.	Increase	position	size			How	to	learn	to	trade	forex		We've	learned	about	forex	trading	basics,	about	demo	trading.	Question	still	stands	–	how	 to	 learn	 to	 trade	 forex?	 There	 are	 few	 steps	 you	 can	 take	 to	 learn	 it.	 Below	 I	mentioned	most	important	ones.		Find	a	mentor	It	 is	 not	 an	 easy	 task	 to	 find	 mentor.	 In	 most	 cases,	 there	 are	 no	 ads	 or	 other	information	about	mentoring	possibility.	Initiative	should	be	on	your	side.	If	you	follow	trader	you	like,	then	you	can	ask	him	about	mentoring.	Some	will	say	no	because	of	lack	of	time.	Others	do	not	like	to	mentor	because	not	everyone	has	teaching	skills.	Still,	finding	a	mentor	is	the	fastest	way	to	learn	to	trade	Forex.	With	mentor,	you	will	avoid	many	mistakes	and	sometimes	save	many	years	of	trial	and	errors.	Two	important	things	to	remember.	Do	not	approach	mentor	if	you	don't	have	basic	knowledge	about	trading.	It	is	not	a	role	for	mentor	to	guide	you	through	the	basic	stuff.	You	want	mentor	to	teach	you	how	to	trade	successfully,	not	to	teach	basics.		Another	thing	to	remember.	Check	different	styles	of	trading.	Decide	which	one	suits	you	best.	Do	you	like	technical	analysis	more?	Then	look	for	mentors	who	trade	mainly	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	13		with	TA.	You	have	a	job	and	you	want	to	learn	about	long	term	trading?	Then	do	not	look	for	help	from	day	traders,	just	go	and	look	for	other	long-term	investors.		Learn	to	trade	on	demo	Before	you	move	to	trading	with	money	start	with	demo.	Play	with	different	currencies,	instruments.	Understand	what	leverage	is	all	about.	See	how	spread	is	different	for	different	forex	pairs.	Test	different	trading	strategies.		Read	trading	books	(not	only	about	forex)	Of	course,	practice	is	most	important	but	books	will	give	you	new	ideas	how	you	can	trade	forex.	There	are	so	many	books	about	trading,	that	it	is	hard	to	recommend	only	few.	One	important	things	about	books.	Reading	more	trading	books	does	not	make	you	a	better	trader.	It	can	give	you	some	ideas,	you	can	learn	something	new	but	you	must	practice	this	in	live	market.	Just	a	quick	reminder,	because	I	met	many	aspiring	traders	who	were	reading	too	much	and	trading	too	little	;).	Candlestick	patterns	No	revolution	here.	Japanese	Candlestick	Charting	Techniques	by	Steve	Nison	is	still	a	good	choice.	Chart	patterns	I	recommend	books	from	Thomas	Bulkowski	like	Getting	Started	in	Chart	Patterns.	He	did	a	solid	study	about	chart	patterns	and	included	how	often	you	can	profit	with	them.	Multiple	time	frames	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	14		http://www.technicalanalysisbook.com/	 I	 recommend	 Technical	 Analysis	 Book	 by	Brian	Shannon	(from	alphatrends.net).	He	is	a	stock	trader	but	knowledge	from	this	book	is	universal.	It	will	give	you	ideas	how	to	use	and	trade	multiple	time	frames	and	I	can	say	from	my	experience	–	this	is	crucial.	Trading	psychology	Good	trading	system	is	not	enough	to	stay	profitable.	Trader	psychology	and	discipline	is	a	key	factor	to	success.	There	are	many	books	about	that	topic,	but	you	can	start	with	Trading	Zone	by	Mark	Douglas.	Pivot	Points	I	use	pivot	points	on	daily	basis	and	I	wrote	some	articles	about	them.	If	you	want	to	learn	more,	I	can	recommend	two	books	about	Pivot	Points.	If	you	are	totally	new	to	the	topic,	Candlestick	and	Pivot	Point	Trading	Triggers	by	John	L.	Person	is	a	good	choice.	You	can	learn	here	how	pivot	works,	how	to	use	them	and	see	some	setups	examples.	For	more	advanced	stuff	about	Pivots,	I	recommend	Secrets	of	a	Pivot	Boss	by	Frank	Ochoa.	 One	 of	 best	 trading	 books.	 Not	 a	 cheap	 one,	 but	 worth	 its	 price.	 Lot	 of	knowledge	and	trading	ideas.	Fibonacci	As	you	know,	I	am	a	big	Fibonacci	fan.	I	write	alot	about	that	topic,	but	if	you	want	to	read	a	book	about	Fibonacci,	then	there	is	one	position	I	can	recommend.	It	is	Fibonacci	Trading.	 Master	 Price	 Advantage	 by	 Carolyn	 Boroden.	 It	 is	 a	 good	 introduction	 to	various	Fibo	tools.	Ichimoku	There	are	few	books	about	Ichimoku	Kinko	Hyo.	I	read	them	all,	but	I	can	recommend	only	Ichimoku	Charts	by	Elliott	Nicolle.	I	use	Ichimoku	only	as	additional	indicator,	but	it	is	still	important	one.	Especially	in	Forex.

In	most	cases,	you	can	ask	questions	during	a	webinar	or	there	is	dedicated	Q&A	session	right	after	webinars	finish.			Go	to	courses	Yes,	many	Forex	traders	are	losing	money.	Brokers	know	that.	That	is	main	reason	why	they	organize	free	trading	courses	(online	and	stationary).	Often	they	hire	well	known	traders	who	teach	you	about	trading.		Of	course,	not	every	course	is	free.	Sometimes	you	can	find	good	trading	course	which	costs	quite	a	lot.	Decision	is	yours.	I	can	say	from	my	perspective	that	you	can	learn	a	lot	during	such	courses.	I	attended	few	of	them,	each	was	2-days	long.	I	must	say	–	this	was	a	knowledge	based	on	trading	experience	and	it	helped	me	to	jump	into	another	level.		Follow	other	traders	on	twitter/fb	Social	media	are	great.	There	is	so	much	valuable	information	here,	better	than	cats	:)	Look	for	traders	via	hashtags	and	other	search	terms.

Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	18		Forex	trading	questions	–	our	Forex	tips		Naked	trading	and	price	action	You	must	try	it	at	least	once.	As	stated	before,	most	indicators	are	calculated	based	on	price.	Yet,	still	many	traders	can’t	read	a	single	thing	from	a	chart.	It	is	all	because	they	relay	so	heavy	on	indicators	and	do	not	put	enough	attention	to	price	itself.	Goal	here	is	to	remove	all	indicators,	all	moving	averages	and	other	indicator	from	chart.	You	want	chart	to	be	naked.	This	way	you	can	see	clearly	price	action	and	make	decisions	based	on	price	itself.	I	have	read	about	trader	who	uses	indicators	and	other	tools.	Every	few	weeks	he	turns	them	off	and	trade	only	based	on	price	action.	Why	is	that	important?	Thanks	to	naked	trading	you	will	learn	much	faster	about	price	action.	There	are	moments	when	it	is	crucial.	You	will	get	first	signals	from	price	and	then,	 later,	 from	 indicators.	 Therefore,	 it	 is	 important	 to	know	 how	 to	 spot	 signals	which	price	gives	you.		Fundamental	vs	technical	analysis	It	is	a	personal	choice.	Only	one	advice	here.	Do	not	ignore	the	other	side.	If	someone	says	that	he	is	technical	trader	and	do	not	look	at	fundamentals	and	news,	then	he	is	not	someone	you	want	to	follow	There	are	so	many	evidences	that	news	can	move	the	market.	Many	big	players	simply	close	all	trades	before	important	news,	because	market	can	be	unpredictable.	I	mostly	use	technical	analysis,	but	I	always	start	the	day	from	checking	news	schedule	for	current	day.	Good	source	for	news	and	data?	http://www.forexfactory.com.	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	19		Avoid	magic	trading	systems!	When	you	browse	Internet	looking	for	info	about	Forex,	most	likely	you	will	see	ads	or	reviews	of	some	super	automatic	trading	systems.	In	a	description,	you	will	see	list	of	trades	made	on	historical	data	even	10	years	back:			
	Looks	great.	Where	is	a	catch?	These	systems	are	optimized	for	historical	data.	On	many	times,	you	will	see	that	possible	drawdown	is	very	big.	It	is	because	authors	use	very	wide	stop	losses.	This	way	many	trades	are	closed	eventually	with	profit,	but	when	something	goes	wrong,	you	end	up	with	huge	loss.	Another	way	to	con	the	system	is	to	optimize	robot	for	historical	data.	When	you	put	that	same	robot	in	real	live	trading	results	are	not	so	great	anymore.		There	is	no	magic	automated	system	for	99$	or	999$.	Forget	about	it.	Work	hard,	learn,	trade.		Forex	major	currency	pairs	You	can	see	a	lot	of	pairs	in	your	brokers	offer,	but	four	of	them	are	most	popular.	Traders	call	them	majors:	• EUR/USD:	The	euro	and	the	U.S.	dollar.		
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	20		• USD/JPY:	The	U.S.	dollar	and	the	Japanese	yen.		• GBP/USD:	The	British	pound	sterling	and	the	U.S.	dollar.		• USD/CHF:	The	U.S.	dollar	and	the	Swiss	franc.				Which	pair	is	best	to	trade?	I	think	that	it	is	best	to	start	with	majors,	because	you	have	there	the	lowest	spreads	and	 best	 liquidity.	 Maybe	 without	 USD/CHF,	 because	 after	 Swiss	 central	 bank	interventions	it	is	not	good	pair	to	trade.		EUR/USD	is	still	a	good	pair	to	trade;	it	is	great	both	on	lower	time	frames	and	on	bigger	ones.	I	also	recommend	to	check	Yen	pairs,	especially	GBP/JPY.	Here	you	can	find	many	good	trend	moves,	even	on	lower	timeframes.	On	chart	below	there	is	1-hour	GBP/JPY	chart.	It	took	only	couple	of	days	for	this	pair	to	move	more	than	1300	pips	up.				
	
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	21		Other	Yen	pairs	are	also	nice	to	trade.	Now,	because	of	Brexit	it	is	good	to	keep	close	eye	on	GBP	pairs.	Pound	is	generally	getting	weaker	and	weaker	across	the	board.	Thanks	to	that	we	can	see	here	some	strong	moves	both	down	and	strong	corrections	up.		It	is	not	recommended	to	trade	on	exotic	pairs.	There	are	two	reasons	for	that:	- High	spreads	–	costs	of	trading	here	can	be	very	high	- Liquidity	is	not	that	good	as	on	major	pairs	Unless	you	have	some	long-term	approach;	maybe	you	are	resident	of	that	country.	But	stick	to	the	most	popular	pairs.			How	many	pairs	should	you	trade?	As	a	new	trader,	you	should	start	with	one	pair.	Why?	Two	or	more	pairs	are	hard	to	follow.	Remember	that	you	should	check	situation	on	few	time	frames	to	take	a	trade.	With	two	or	more	pairs	you	will	struggle	to	follow	price	actions.	Select	one	pair.	It	is	enough.	Every	pair	has	its	own	characteristic.	If	you	jump	between	pairs,	you	won’t	notice	this.	Also,	it	is	important	to	check	situation	on	higher	time	frames.	When	you	do	that	on	many	trading	pairs,	it	is	hard	to	follow	price	action	for	new	traders.			Do	I	need	10	displays?	You	 probably	 saw	 photos	 of	 trade	 stations	 where	 traders	 have	 4,	 6	 or	even	 more	displays.	It	is	not	necessary;	you	can	easily	start	with	your	current	setup.	So	why	traders	use	so	many	displays?	Couple	of	reasons.	They	follow	action	on	many	pairs.	They	also	follow	news,	check	important	levels	on	other	time	frames.	Simply,	it	is	much	easier	to	do	all	that	with	few	displays.	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	22		But	if	you	start	trading,	don’t	worry	about	that.	If	you	want	to	have	more	than	one	monitor,	it	is	not	that	costly.	You	can	buy	a	PC	with	graphic	card	which	has	two	slots	for	displays	or	you	can	use	SLI	technology	(more	than	one	graphic	card	in	one	computer).	Displays	are	also	not	expensive.	You	can	buy	a	24	inch	display	for	around	150	–	200$;	32	inch	displays	are	also	rather	cheap	and	cost	around	400$.			How	much	money	do	I	need	to	start	forex	trading	This	is	 one	 of	 most	 popular	 questions	 about	 Forex	 trading	 	–	how	 much	 money	 is	enough	to	start	trading.	I	will	try	to	answer	this	as	good	as	I	can.		Remember,	you	can	open	trading	account	with	as	little	as	100$	(or	even	less	in	some	cases).	Is	it	enough	to	trade?	Technically,	yes.	With	that	money,	you	can	place	trades	if	broker	has	nano	or	micro	lots	in	his	offer.	So	there	you	go,	100$	is	enough	to	trade	forex.		But	is	it	enough	if	you	are	serious	about	trading?	No.	No,	you	won’t	earn	big	$	in	a	year,	starting	with	300$.	Few	hundred	bucks	are	ok	for	start	in	learning	process.	You	can	play	with	that	money,	make	some	mistakes,	learn	new	things,	grow	as	a	young	trader.	When	you	learn	how	to	trade,	use	money	you	can	afford	to	lose.	That	is	very	important.	Never	trade	with	money	you	can’t	lose.	This	is	brutal	game.	Save	some	money	for	your	trading	account.	People	see	all	that	adverts,	read	about	leverage	and	think	that	they	do	not	need	that	much	capital.	That	is	a	huge	mistake.	Trading	full	time	is	different.	You	need	solid	capital	because	with	that	capital	you	can	make	 profits.	 So	 how	 much	 do	 you	 need?	 Depends	 from	 trader,	 but	 10,000$	 is	 a	minimum	in	my	opinion.	Optimal	amount	for	start	is	in	range	10,000	–	50,000$.	The	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	23		amount	is	strongly	connected	to	your	trading	system	(how	you	handle	risk	level,	do	you	trade	short	term	or	long	term,	and	many	other	things).	When	 you	 follow,	 the	 path	 described	 above	 (demo	->	 real	 with	 small	 capital	 and	micro/nano)	and	you	can	make	money,	you	will	be	able	to	count	how	much	money	you	need	to	think	about	going	full	time.	I	like	the	quote	from	Alexander	Elder.	He	said	that	you	can	start	thinking	about	trading	as	full	time	career	when	you	make	more	money	in	a	month	from	trading	then	from	your	day	job.	Simple	as	that.	Remember	that	you	need	capital	for	start	because	you	must	follow	some	risk	ratio	rules	(defined	by	you).	You	can	follow	rule	to	not	risk	1%	or	0.5%	capital	at	current	time.	Try	to	use	that	in	real	money	trading	and	you	will	understand	quickly	why	you	need	all	that	money	for	start.		Time	frame	Another	big	question	–	which	time	frame	is	the	best?	Again,	it	depends	from	trading	styles,	but	I	can	give	you	few	tips.	The	lower	time	frame,	the	more	automatic	trading	you	will	see.	On	time	frames,	such	low	as	1	minute	there	is	no	time	to	think	slowly	and	analyze	your	decision	twice.	When	price	 hit	 some	 important	 level,	 you	 may	 see	 strong	 counter	 move	 from	 that	 point	(because	 of	 orders	 from	 robots).	Generally,	I	do	not	trade	lower	than	5	min	time	frame.	When	you	are	looking	for	swing	trades,	then	you	should	look	at	higher	time	frames	such	as	1	hour	+.	Of	course,	you	do	not	look	only	at	one	time	frame.	You	should	check	higher	time	frames	to	know	what	is	going	on.	On	lower	time	frame	it	may	look	like	there	is	a	downtrend,	but	higher	time	frames	may	suggest	that	main	trend	is	up.	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	24		But	I	have	a	job…	OK,	it	is	not	like	there	is	only	one	proper	way	to	trade	Forex.	If	you	start	your	trading	adventure,	you	probably	do	not	have	time	to	look	a	whole	day	at	chart.	Is	there	another	way	to	do	it?	Yes.	You	can	switch	to	higher	time	frame	such	as	1	hour,	4	hour	or	simply	start	with	EOD	trading.	EOD	–	End	of	Day	Trading	is	trading	where	you	base	your	trading	decisions	on	daily	chart.	Of	course,	you	have	position	open	for	few	days,	your	stop	losses	are	wider,	but	also	there	is	a	chance	to	get	a	bigger	move	from	stronger	swing	move.	Will	your	strategy	work	on	lower	time	frames?	Yes.	Do	not	worry	about	that.	In	most	cases	your	strategy	will	be	perfectly	fine	on	lower	time	frames.	You	may	need	to	modify	it	and	rebuild	more	or	less,	but	it	should	be	a	solid	strategy	to	move	on	to	trade	on	lower	time	frames.	There	 is	 a	 great	 article	 about	 EOD	 trading	 by	 Forex	 Guy.	 You	 can	 read	 it	 here	 at	http://www.theforexguy.com/forex-end-of-day-trading/.			How	much	do	forex	traders	make	a	day	This	is	a	common	question.	People	want	to	know	how	much	money	can	you	make	trading	Forex.	The	popular	believe	is	that	you	can	get	rich	so	fast	here.	That	is	more	complicated	than	that.		I	think	that	there	are	two	things	that	create	fake	reality	of	Forex	trading:	1) Demo	contests		There	are	a	lot	of	demo	contests	out	there.	You	can	win	some	nice	prizes.	Problem	is	that	they	usually	last	fore	few	weeks	/	other	short	period.	As	a	result,	it	is	simply	a	gambling	contest,	not	a	trading	contest.	Forget	money	management,	strategy…	To	win	here	people	start	multiple	accounts	and	trade	with	highest	leverage	possible.	It	is	not	the	way	they	would	trade	with	real	money	on	daily	basis.			2) Real	results	with	only	percentage	returns		Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	25			That	is	interesting	thing.	Once	I	had	an	account	at	very	well-known	FX	broker.	There	was	no	contest,	just	a	motivational	newsletter	once	each	month	with	best	results	of	their	clients.	OK,	not	a	bad	thing	–	they	were	showing	that	people	are	making	money.	Thing	 is,	 results	 were	 presented	 only	 in	 percentage	 gains.	 That’s	 it.	 Basically	 this	numbers	tell	you	nothing.	Even	if	somebody	earned	1000%	he	might	simply	placed	some	gambling	trade	on	his	100$	account	and	he	earned	with	lucky	shot.			The	big	picture	here	is	very	unclear.	That	is	a	nature	of	this	business	–	brokers	want	more	clients	so	they	do	what	they	do.	People	know	that	many	people	lose	money	on	Forex,	and	yet	they	think	that	they	are	better	than	the	rest.	In	their	mind,	they	can	see	millions	they	can	make	here.	If	 you	 want	 to	 have	 overview	 how	 traders	 are	 doing	 in	 contests,	 head	 to	http://www.myfxbook.com/contests.	 You	 can	 find	 here	 both	 demo	 and	 real	 Forex	contests.	On	the	right,	you	have	analysis	with	more	data	about	each	contest.	I	encourage	you	to	follow	some	traders	on	Twitter	or	simply	to	check	real-money	Forex	contests.	You	will	see	totally	different	side	of	trading.	I	know	traders	(who	trade	for	a	living)	who	sometimes	place	only	5	to	10	trades	per	week.	There	are	weeks	that	this	is	less	then	5	trades.	They	are	watching	charts	all	day	long,	but	they	wait	for	their	best	setups.	Number	of	trades	depends	from	trading	style	but	still	–	it	is	a	different	story	when	you	are	risking	your	real	money.			There	is	no	specific	answer	–	how	much	money	do	Forex	trader	make.	One	thing	we	can	be	sure	–	these	are	not	amounts	like	in	demo	trading.			Is	daytrading	for	you	-	trading	forex	for	a	living	Many	new	traders	think	that	they	should	be	day	trading	to	make	some	serious	money.	That	is	a	mistake.	There	is	nothing	wrong	with	day	trading,	but	now	you	have	many	possibilities	to	trade	on	higher	time	frames.	You	have	pending	orders,	you	can	easily	set	stop	loss	and	profit	target	or	set	trailing	stop	loss.	Thanks	to	that	it	is	easy	to	manage	your	positions,	even	if	you	have	to	be	away	from	computer	for	some	time.		There	 is	 also	 one	 addition	 fact,	 important	 for	 new	 Forex	 traders.	 There	 are	 bigger	chances	that	you	will	lose	money	on	lower	time	frame	than	on	higher	time	frame.	It	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	26		should	be	a	solid	argument	for	new	traders	to	start	trading	Forex	on	higher	time	frames	like	1-hour	or	4-hours.	They	have	much	bigger	chances	here	to	stay	in	the	game	and	to	make	some	profit.		On	lower	time	frame	you	can	meet	so	often	sudden	changes	in	price.	What’s	more,	algo	trading	is	taking	now	big	part	in	price	movements.	You	have	to	be	in	front	of	your	screen	all	the	time	to	follow	action	and	react	in	time.	It	is	very	hard.		As	pointed	before,	you	can	make	good	profit	on	higher	time	frames	and	you	do	not	have	to	follow	price	action	for	the	whole	day.		Also,	trading	on	higher	time	frame	is	a	pass	to	day	day	trading.	You	should	prove	to	yourself	 that	 you	 can	 make	 money	 on	 higher	 frame,	 that	 you	 can	 trade.	 You	 must	collect	enough	trading	capital.	You	can’t	just	jump	in	and	start	day	trading	when	you	are	not	an	experienced	trader	and	just	hope	that	you	can	make	it.	Numbers	are	against	you	so	you	must	be	prepared.			Stress	is	another	important	factor.	When	you	are	day	trading,	you	open	larger	positions	for	shorter	time	of	period.	It	is	not	for	everyone.			Trading	plan	in	Forex	Trading	You	must	have	one.	Simple	as	that.	Of	course,	there	is	a	whole	learning	process	and	you	 will	 be	 testing	 different	 Forex	 trading	 strategies.	 Eventually	 you	 should	 decide	what	works	best	for	you	and	explore	that	part.		Your	goal	is	to	create	trading	plan.	You	should	write	down	things	like:	- which	currency	pair	you	trade	- which	time	frames	you	trade	- when	you	enter	a	trade	(based	on	what	strategy	/	signals)	- when	you	exit	a	trade	(based	on	what	strategy	/	signals)	- stop	losses	–	what	is	your	risk	per	trade	- taking	profits	and	money	management	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	27		If	you	do	not	have	things	like	this	written	down,	then	you	will	be	changing	lot	of	things	at	once.	That	way	you	will	never	find	out	what	you	are	doing	wrong.	I	mentioned	earlier	that	there	are	traders	who	can	watch	price	action	and	wait	for	1	or	2	traders	which	fit	entry	conditions	from	their	trading	plan.	Thanks	to	the	fact	that	they	have	a	strategy,	they	know	what	they	are	waiting	for.		When	you	do	not	have	that	kind	of	information	(from	your	trading	plan)	then	you	act	based	on	a	hunch	or	emotions.	That	is	not	a	way	how	you	want	to	trade.		As	I	said,	when	you	start	to	learn	how	to	trade	Forex,	it	is	normal	that	you	will	be	testing	different	systems	and	strategies.	In	the	end,	you	should	choose	one	and	take	your	time	to	master	it.		And	trading	plan	can	help	in	that	a	lot.												Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	28		PART	 2.	FOREX	 TRADING	 TOOLS	AND	STRATEGIES			In	this	part	of	guide,	we	will	look	into	different	trading	tools	and	strategies.	Of	course	this	is	still	more	like	overview	because	topic	itself	is	very	wide.	I	want	you	to	see	that	there	is	a	choice	to	make.			Which	trading	tool	is	best	for	you?		There	are	many	tools	like	oscillators,	averages	and	others.	Common	mistake	among	new	traders	is	to	mix	everything	up.	They	feel	more	comfortable	when	there	are	more	tools	on	chart.	This	way	it	is	hard	to	learn	with	one	specific	tool.	Because	you	have	so	many	tools	on	chart	you	will	act	on	different	signals.	Yes,	some	indicators	work	great	together	but	you	should	know	what	are	you	looking	for.	This	may	be	very	confusing.	Result	is	always	the	same	–	no	progress.		Try	to	start	with	few	averages	and	one	oscillator	(if	you	plan	to	use	that	tools).	Trade	with	that	setup	for	some	time	–	at	least	for	few	weeks.	Try	to	optimize	parameters.		One	more	thing,	read	about	your	trading	tools.	What	is	formula	behind	them,	how	they	work.	Sometimes	you	can	see	screen	with	2	or	3	oscillators	which	are	basically	very	like	each	other.	There	is	no	point	in	that.	Try	to	understand	how	your	indicator	works.						Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	29		Which	strategy	is	right	for	you?		There	are	many	approaches	here.	Some	traders	prefer	to	follow	trend	on	longer	time	frames.	Others	like	to	open	positions	more	often	–	they	are	swing	trading.	Add	to	that	possibility	to	trade	fundamental,	to	write	your	own	trading	robot	or	trade	naked.	That	is	a	good	thing.	But	what	about	best	strategy	for	new	traders?	I	would	say	that	it	should	be	a	strategy	that	allows	you	to	trade	on	higher	time	frames	and	profit	on	longer	moves.	 It	 doesn’t	 have	 to	 be	 trend	 following	 strategy,	 it	 can	 be	 also	 swing	 trading	strategy.				I	wrote	about	it	before,	but	I	mention	it	again.	Most	new	traders	think	that	they	must	trade	on	lower	time	frames	to	make	money.	For	them	these	low	time	frames	are	like	deep	dangerous	water	for	new	diver.	This	is	a	place	where	sometimes	more	than	half	of	trades	is	done	by	robots.	We	have	also	High	Frequency	Trading.	And	biggest	of	all	-	risk	to	overtrade.		On	higher	time	frame	there	is	more	time	to	analyze	current	situation,	to	check	other	time	frames.	When	you	catch	a	good	move,	you	can	make	sometimes	very	large	profit.	To	make	money	on	lower	time	frame	you	must	invest	with	high	leverage.	And	for	new	traders	high	leverage	is	a	killer.		What	settings	are	best	for	my	stochastic/macd/rsi/other	on	eurusd/gbpjpy/other?	Please,	don’t	ask	that	question.	There	are	so	many	different	setups.	Each	currency	has	its	own	characteristic.	Each	timeframe	is	different.	Just	use	price	history.	With	that	you	can	select	the	best	settings	for	your	tools.		Most	common	mistake	–	invisible	price	action	The	most	important	thing	to	remember	is	that	all	is	based	on	price.	If	you	add	to	many	indicators,	averages	and	other	tools	then	you	may	miss	important	price	action.	That	is	why	it	is	good	to	trade	on	naked	chart	–	at	least	from	time	to	time.	Thanks	to	that	you	will	be	more	aware	of	price	movements.	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	30		Pivot	Points		In	my	opinion	one	of	the	most	important	tool	for	your	trading.			What	is	on	the	chart		We	have	few	horizontal	lines:	Pivot	line	–	this	is	the	middle	line	R1,	R2,	R3…	-	resistance	lines,	above	Pivot	line	S1,	S2,	S3…	-	support	lines,	below	Pivot	line	We	can	calculate	more	higher	levels	like	S4,	R4	and	so	on	but	in	practice	you	will	need	only	levels	1,2	and	3.			These	lines	are	calculated	based	on	previous	period	(to	be	specific	in	formula	we	can	find	high,	low,	close).	Because	of	that	we	have:		1-hour	Pivot	Points	–	calculated	on	high,	low,	close	of	previous	hour	4-hour	Pivot	Points	–	calculated	on	high,	low,	close	of	previous	4	hours	Daily	Pivot	Points	–	calculated	on	high,	low,	close	of	previous	day	Weekly	Pivot	Points	–	calculated	on	high,	low,	close	of	previous	week	Monthly	Pivot	Points	–	calculated	on	high,	low,	close	of	previous	month	Yearly	Pivot	Points	–	calculated	on	high,	low,	close	of	previous	year		As	you	can	expect,	R	lines	work	as	resistance	for	price,	S	lines	as	support.	Idea	here	is	that	price	tend	to	move	around	pivot	line.	Even	in	an	uptrend,	after	hitting	a	resistance	we	can	expect	a	correction	down	to	the	pivot	line.	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	31		Like	in	the	example	below.	Price	was	moving	around	pivot	line	(black	line).	Then	we	saw	a	strong	move	down	to	the	S2	area.	Then	a	pullback	and	again	move	around	pivot	line.	When	there	is	no	clear	trend	in	place,	we	can	see	such	behavior	where	pivot	line	is	center	for	price	action.	
			Which	Pivots	are	best	for	you?	So	we	know	that	there	are	daily,	weekly,	monthly…	Which	one	is	best	for	you?	Depends	from	your	main	timeframe	and	trading	style.	The	most	popular	are	of	course	daily	Pivot	Points.	You	have	to	test	it	by	yourself	which	Pivots	works	best	for	your	trading.	As	a	little	help,	we	can	try	separate	them	like	this:		1h,	4h	Pivots	–	suitable	for	lowest	TFs	Daily	Pivot	points	–	suitable	for	TF	from	1m	to	1h	Weekly	pivots	–	suitable	for	FT	like	4h,	daily	Monthly	–	suitable	for	TF	like	4h,	daily,	weekly	Yearly	–	suitable	for	TF	like	weekly,	monthly		
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	32		Strategy	based	on	Pivots		You	can	build	your	main	trading	strategy	based	on	Pivots	or	you	can	use	them	as	an	addition	to	other	strategy.		Few	important	notes	about	pivots.		When	price	is	below	Pivot	line,	this	line	may	act	as	a	resistance.	Similar	situation	with	price	above	Pivot,	it	will	work	as	support.	Most	important	are	second	lines.	So,	in	other	words,	there	is	a	big	chance	that	the	main	target	for	current	move	will	be	S2	or	R2.	These	are	levels	where	traders	like	to	take	profits.	Because	of	that	you	can	expect	correction	move	from	these	lines.	R3,	S3.	There	are	times	when	trend	is	very	strong	and	price	move	up	to	the	R3	or	down	to	the	S3	line.	In	that	case,	you	should	take	profit	at	S3	or	R3.	Do	not	hope	for	move	to	continue.	In	most	cases	it	will	end	at	S3	or	R3.	Of	course,	you	can	close	part	of	your	position	at	3rd	line	and	let	the	rest	roll.	Still,	from	my	experience	I	can	tell	that	it	is	very	unusual	for	price	to	move	higher	than	R3	line	or	lower	than	S3	line.	Pivots	from	higher	time	frame.	There	are	times	when	it	is	good	to	check	situation	for	higher	time	frames.	I	like	to	open	separate	chart	for	that.	There	are	situations	when	lines	from	two	different	Pivots	are	near	to	each	other.	For	example	we	may	have	daily	R2	near	weekly	R1.	This	is	very	important	information	for	us	because	we	know	where	is	the	strong	support	and	where	we	should	take	profits.								Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	33		Pivot	Points	trade	examples		USD/JPY	H1,	weekly	pivots		
			
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	34		This	is	an	hourly	chart	of	USD/JPY	with	weekly	Pivot	points.	Trend	is	up.	Price	is	above	Pivot	line.	After	a	range	move	there	was	a	break	above	trend	line	and	you	can	see	strong	move	up.	It	ended	exactly	at	R3	level.	It	is	a	rare	situation.	In	most	cases	you	will	see	that	price	respect	resistance	lines	at	R1	and	R2.	Sometimes	there	is	news	or	some	other	reason	for	that	kind	of	strong	move.				GBP/JPY	5m	daily	Pivot	lines			
			
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	35		On	chart	above	we	have	GBP/JPY,	5m	chart	with	daily	Pivot	lines.	It	is	an	interesting	situation.	For	the	first	part	of	a	day	price	was	above	Pivot	line	which	worked	as	support.		Later	situation	changed.	Pivot	stopped	to	work	as	support,	there	was	also	a	resistance	from	moving	average.	Suddenly,	GBP/JPY	tanked.	We	can	see	that	it	went	straight	to	the	S2	line.			That	chart	shows	why	it	is	important	to	set	take	profit	orders.	It	was	only	a	moment	when	price	was	at	S2	line	and	there	was	a	strong	bounce	back.	You	would	not	be	able	to	close	it	manually.				EUR/USD,	4h	monthly	Pivot	Points		
	
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	36					Last	example	is	EUR/USD,	4h	chart	with	monthly	Pivot	Points.	It	is	rare	when	you	check	monthly	pivot	lines,	but	as	you	can	see	they	also	work.	In	this	case	Pivot	line	worked	as	a	resistance,	later	move	up	ended	at	monthly	R2.																			Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	37		Fibonacci	trading	tools		There	are	many	tools	based	on	Fibonacci	numbers.	Below	short	overview.		Popular	Fibonacci	tools		Fibonacci	retracement	Fibonacci	 retracement	 is	 the	 most	 popular	 tool	 used	 by	 traders	 who	 are	 trading	 with	Fibonacci.	It	helps	you	to	predict	where	correction	might	end.		Do	you	remember	how	in	the	beginning	of	this	article	I	wrote	about	nature	of	trends?	When	price	is	in	an	uptrend,	there	is	a	sequence	of	higher	highs,	but	there	is	also	a	sequence	of	higher	lows,	or	simply	corrections.	This	is	something	natural	for	uptrend	–	price	move	up,	up	and	suddenly	it	is	falling	down.	That	is	correction	and	it	is	a	good	thing,	because	it	let	you	to	enter	position	for	better	price.	Fibonacci	 retracement	 helps	 you	 to	 find	places	 where	 correction	 might	 stop.	 With	 that	knowledge	you	can	plan	to	enter	a	position	from	there	in	a	direction	of	main	trend.		
		Fibonacci	expansion	You	can	also	predict	where	there	will	be	the	next	high	or	low.	You	can	do	this	with	Fibonacci	expansion.	To	do	that	you	need	to	find	three	points.	A	and	B	from	main	swing	(low	and	high)	and	 point	 C	 where	 correction	 ended	 (similar	 points	 as	 you	 would	 be	 looking	 to	 draw	retracement	levels	but	here	you	have	to	know/decide	where	correction	ended).	With	that	points	you	are	able	to	draw	Fibonacci	expansion	and	in	result	you	have	few	projections	where	might	be	next	high/low.	There	are	more	levels,	but	standard	are	61.8%,	100%	and	161.8%.	
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	38			There	is	also	extension	based	only	on	two	points	(A	and	B),	which	also	gives	projection	levels,	but	let’s	do	not	complicate	things	too	much.			Fibonacci	time	zones	Interesting	tool	which	you	draw	horizontally.	There	is	many	ways	you	can	draw	it	–	from	high	to	high,	high	to	low,	low	to	high…	In	a	result	you	have	vertical	lines,	which	represents	time	when	there	might	be	end	of	move	or	some	change	of	direction.	
			Fibonacci	arc	It	is	another	tool	which	represents	areas	of	support/resistance,	but	in	another	way.	You	draw	Fibonacci	arc	from	high	to	low	or	low	to	high.	As	a	result	you	can	see	three	curves	38.2%,	50%	and	61.8%	which	represents	possible	place	where	price	action	might	stop/reverse.	
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	39			Fibonacci	arc	example		Fibonacci	Fan	With	this	tool	you	get	three	diagonal	lines.	Each	one	of	them	represents	Fibonacci	ratio	and	when	 price	is	 getting	 close	 to	 this	 lines,	 you	 know	 that	 this	 might	 be	 area	 of	 support	 or	resistance.	You	draw	a	trendline	between	low	and	high	to	get	this	lines.		Actually,	this	tool	is	pretty	handy.	Try	to	exercise	on	historical	data,	or	test	it	in	your	trading.	It	is	all	about	selecting	right	low	and	high	and	you	will	get	good	results.	
	Fibonacci	fan	example		There	are	some	other	tools	based	on	Fibonacci	numbers,	but	these	are	most	known.	If	you	are	confused	right	now	and	you	do	not	know	which	one	you	should	use,	then	let	me	give	you	small	advice.	 Start	 from	 Fibonacci	 retracement	 and	 master	 using	 it.	 Then	 add	 to	 your	 toolbox	Fibonacci	expansion	–	it	is	important	tool,	because	it	let	you	predict	the	best	points	to	close	position.			
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	40		Most	popular	combination	is	Fibonacci	Extension	+	Fibonacci	Retracement:		Fibonacci	Extension	–	they	work	as	possible	target	for	the	move	(take	profit	area)	Fibonacci	Retracement	–	they	work	as	support	during	a	correction		Setup	in	Metatrader	Now	let’s	have	a	look	how	to	setup	Fibonacci	so	you	have	most	popular	levels	in	place.

Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	45		Fibonacci	trading	in	Forex		To	draw	Fibonacci,	we	need	to	select	a	swing	move.	Additionally,	we	have	to	try	to	do	that	in	the	right	direction.	That	is	why	it	is	crucial	to	understand	price	behavior,	trends,	swings.	Let’s	 start	 from	 tricky	 question	 and	 basics	 of	 price	 behavior.	 In	 which	direction,	 can	 price	move?	You	probably	would	answer:	up	and	down.	That	is	correct	answer,	only	that	there	is	one	“but”.	What	if	there	is	no	main	trend?	If	there	is	no	strong	trend,	price	will	probably	move	sideways.	Statistics	says	that	price	is	about	30%	of	time	in	trend	and	rest	of	this	time	is	moving	in	range.	Why	moving	in	range	is	so	bad	thing?	Because	there	is	no	clear	direction	and	price	move	up	and	down	so	it	is	very	hard	to	make	money	in	that	kind	of	movement.	Just	look	at	chart	below,	is	it	something	you	would	like	to	trade?			sideway	move	example		I	think	so.	What	we	want	to	trade	is	trending	market.	Going	into	trend	direction	increases	your	chances	of	success.	Look	at	this	beautiful	trend	below.	Isn’t	it	something	you	would	like	to	trade?	On	the	short	side	of	course!			
	downtrend	example		
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	46		We	want	to	use	Fibonacci	technique	in	that	kind	of	market.	Before	I	go	further	and	explain	more	about	this,	there	is	another	important	thing	you	must	learn.		How	to	recognize	trend?	You	should	be	able	to	easy	recognize	if	there	is	a	trend	in	place	or	not.	Sometimes	it	is	hard	because	of	the	“noise”,	but	there	are	some	tips	you	can	use.		Look	for	higher	highs	and	higher	lows,	if	you	are	looking	for	uptrend.	I	have	probably	showed	you	 this	 charts	 before,	 but	 this	is	 important.	 On	 chart	 below	 you	 can	 see	 an	 example	 of	uptrend.	You	can	see	that	every	high	is	higher	than	the	previous	one,	and	every	low	is	higher	than	previous	low.		
	higher	high	sequence		When	you	can	find	these	elements	on	chart,	then	you	have	identified	an	uptrend.		In	downtrend	you	should	look	for	lower	lows	and	lower	highs.	Each	low	is	lower	than	the	previous	one,	and	each	high	is	lower	than	previous	high.	Just	like	on	chart	below:	
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	47			lower	low	sequence		If	you	are	able	to	identify	lower	lows	sequence,	than	you	have	found	a	downtrend	and	you	can	plan	to	enter	short	position.	In	range	market	there	is	no	sequence,	therefore	there	is	no	trend.		You	can	also	use	simpler	tools	to	define	trend.	Most	popular	moving	average	is	a	good	choice.	Lets	say	you	are	using	200	simple	moving	average.	When	moving	average	is	rising	and	price	is	above	that	line,	than	there	is	a	strong	chance	that	trend	is	up.	If	trend	is	down,	price	will	be	under	200	SMA.	Of	course	this	method	does	not	make	you	100%	sure,	but	the	chances	are	good.		
	200	SMA	as	a	help	in	trend	identyfying		So,	what	really	Fibonacci	trading	is?		Now,	when	you	know	what	kind	of	trends	there	are	and	how	to	recognize	the	current	trend,	we	can	move	to	answer	the	question	from	title.	What	is	Fibonacci	trading	about?	Fibonacci	trading	is	a	technique,	where	you	are	using	tools	based	on	Fibonacci	numbers	to	predict	possible	turning	points	(if	you	want	to	read	what	it	is	Fibonacci	number,	just	go	here).		
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	48		There	are	many	tools	which	you	can	use	for	trading	with	Fibonacci.	Each	of	them	do	a	different	job.	Some	are	more	important,	some	less.	Lest	review	them	quickly.			How	to	trade	with	Fibonacci?		Now	you	know	what	does	it	mean	Fibonacci	trading,	and	what	kinds	of	Fibonacci	tools	we	have	(plenty	of	them!).	There	is	one	more	important	question	to	answer.	How	should	you	trade	with	these	tools?		Notice	 that	 all	 this	 tools	 give	 you	 a	 potential	 level	 of	 support/resistance	 or	 potential	 exit	points.	This	is	very	valuable	information!	But	how	to	use	it	for	your	benefits?	Of	course,	I	am	not	able	to	answer	you	in	few	words,	but	I	can	give	you	some	advice	what	should	you	do.		You	should	build	trading	plan.	The	main	core	of	your	trading	plan	will	be	Fibonacci	tools.	As	I	wrote	before,	first	include	Fibonacci	retracement	and	extension	to	your	plan.	Next,	you	need	some	signals	which	help	you	to	enter	and	exit	positions.	The	logic	here	is	that	when	price	is	in	uptrend	and	correction	occur,	you	draw	retracement	levels.	When	price	is	near	one	of	them,	you	do	not	know	which	one	will	be	a	support.	That	is	ok,	because	you	define	your	own	signal	and	when	price	return	to	move	up	from	correction,	you	get	your	signal.	It	might	be	something	simple	like	moving	averages	crossover	or	signal	from	some	oscillator.		Same	with	closing	position.	You	should	define	on	which	signal	you	will	exit	your	position.	It	will	be	probably	near	one	of	expansion	levels,	so	you	will	be	ready	to	act.	The	last,	very	important	part	of	your	trading	plan	is	money	management.	You	should	keep	your	losses	small.	It	is	very	important	to	trade	smart	and	not	to	risk	too	much.		Some	 of	 this	 information	 are	 not	 very	 specific,	 but	 the	 whole	 topic	 about	 trading	 with	Fibonacci	is	very	wide.	In	the	end,	it	is	about	practice,	practice,	practice.	You	should	be	testing	new	ideas	and	getting	experience.	Trading	with	Fibonacci	is	great,	because	you	have	possible	support	and	resistance	levels	and	even	exit	points.	Of	course,	they	are	only	possible	levels,	but	on	many	times	they	work	excellent.	You	need	to	build	your	whole	trading	plan	around	these	levels,	 so	 around	 Fibonacci	 tools.	 Add	 to	 this	 entry	 and	 exit	 signals	 and	 proper	 money	management	system	and	you	are	on	great	way	to	success	in	trading.			ABCD	and	Fibonacci	trading		There	are	more	advanced	techniques	to	trade	with	Fibonacci,	but	you	should	start	with	ABCD.	This	is	simple	yet	powerful	approach.	In	short,	we	look	for	a	swing.	Based	on	that	swing	we	draw	our	Fibonacci	lines	(A	and	B).	Next,	we	wait	for	a	correction	to	retracement	–	C.	After	that	we	open	a	trade	and	wait	for	continuation	move	towards	D	(which	is	an	extension	line).	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	49		Look	at	some	examples	below,	it	should	be	clear.		Fibonacci	trade	examples		GBP/JPY	1	hour	chart		
	Here	we	have	example	of	GBP/JPY.	We	can	see	that	after	strong	move	down	(from	A	to	B)	there	was	a	correction	up.	This	was	a	good	moment	to	draw	Fibonacci	lines	and	wait	for	signal	to	go	short.	Correction	ended	at	78.6%	and	after	that	there	were	signals	from	MACD	and	Stochastic.	This	short	trade	worked	well.	Move	ended	at	138.2	Fibonacci	extension	and	it	was	our	D	point.	
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	50			EUR/USD	30m	
		In	this	EUR/USD	example	time	frame	is	30m.	We	are	in	an	uptrend	and	after	strong	move	to	the	B	there	was	a	correction.	It	was	rather	deep,	down	to	the	78.6	retracement	line	(our	C	point).	Next	EUR/USD	returned	to	the	uptrend.	We	saw	some	signals	to	go	long.	This	was	a	strong	move	up,	with	short	stop	at	161.8%	extension	line.	Eventually	move	ended	at	200%	extension	line,	this	was	our	D	point.					
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	51		DAX	15m		
	This	is	15m	chart	of	DAX.	It	is	a	good	example,	because	it	shows	how	universal	Fibonacci	tools	are.	They	work	with	currency,	with	commodities,	stocks,	indices…		On	the	chart,	we	can’t	see	the	left	side	–	there	was	an	uptrend	move	before.	It	ended,	price	went	down	below	averages.	There	was	a	correction	to	the	C	(50%	retracement).	From	there	some	move	in	the	range	and	strong	move	down	to	the	200%	extension	line	(D).			
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	52		Trailing	stop		Trailing	stop	is	another	great	tool	which	can	help	in	your	Forex	trading.	It	is	simple,	but	can	help	you	to	catch	big	moves.		There	are	few	types	of	trailing	stop	losses.	Sometimes	they	are	built	in	the	trading	platform.	 You	 can’t	 find	 them	 in	 Metatrader	 so	 you	 must	 download	 and	 install	 it.	Search	for	chandelier	mt4	trailing	stop	loss	and	you	should	find	the	best	version.		How	to	use	trailing	stop	loss	Idea	behind	trailing	stop	loss	is	very	simple.	If	price	is	above	trailing	line,	you	should	be	long.	If	it	is	below	trailing	line,	you	should	be	short.	Simple	as	that.		The	main	advantage	of	trailing	stop	loss	is	that	it	allows	you	to	stay	in	the	trend	and	take	big	profit	of	that.		
			Example	above	shows	rather	well	how	it	works.	It	works	as	stop	line.	You	can	see	that	when	move	up	ended	and	price	closed	below	blue	line,	it	was	time	to	close	trade.		
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	53		Best	settings	for	trailing	stop	loss	It	is	a	common	question	–	best	settings	for	trailing	stop	loss.	You	should	work	it	out	by	yourself.	One	settings	may	work	great	on	specific	currency	and	time	frame	but	they	can	be	out	of	place	on	another.	That	is	why	it	is	best	to	test	settings	on	price	history.	You	can	play	with	Length	and	ATR	Period	but	it	is	Kv	parameter	which	interest	you	most.				
		It	is	not	always	that	easy	Trailing	stop	loss	is	easy	to	use,	but	there	are	things	you	should	remember	about.	It	works	great	when	trend	is	strong.	There	are	times	where	moves	are	strong	or	when	there	is	no	specific	direction.		When	there	is	a	range	move,	you	can	easily	overtrade	and	lose	money.	So,	we	are	talking	about	situations	like	this:		
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	54					Time	frame	for	trailing	stop	loss	Time	frame	depends	from	your	trading	style,	but	you	can	try	trailing	stop	loss	on	time	frames	like	15m,	30m,	1h.		Trends	here	can	last	for	some	time	and	profit	may	be	good.	If	you	go	lower	with	trailing	stop	like	1m,	5m	it	is	much	harder	–	mainly	because	rapid	moves.				Strategy	for	trailing	stop	loss	You	can	use	only	trailing	stop	loss	but	it	works	best	when	you	join	it	with	other	tools.	As	always,	you	want	to	trade	in	the	direction	of	current	trend.	That	is	why	it	is	ok	to	join	trailing	stop	loss	with	averages.	Thanks	to	that	you	can	filter	false	signals,	like	in	example	below.	After	move	down	there	was	a	change	in	trailing	stop	loss	and	signal	to	go	long.	As	you	can	see,	price	was	then	below	average.	That	means	that	it	was	best	to	wait	for	break	above	it.	It	didn’t	happen.	It	was	a	false	signal	after	all.

Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	56		Trade	examples			GBP/JPY,	30m		
		First,	there	was	a	signal	to	go	long	and	strong	move	up.	When	move	ended,	price	closed	below	blue	line,	it	was	signal	to	close.	Next,	price	was	below	red	line	(signal	to	go	short)	but	 it	 was	 above	 moving	average.	 It	 was	 best	 to	 wait	 for	 another	 confirmation.	Eventually,	price	broke	below	that	average,	but	notice	that	it	was	still	above	support	line.	It	is	important	to	draw	support	/	resistance	lines	because	they	help	us	to	make	trading	decision.			
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	57			USD/JPY,	4h		
		This	is	a	good	example	that	sometimes	trailing	stop	loss	can	help	you	to	catch	really	big	moves.	If	you	are	a	long	term	trader,	you	can	easily	use	it	in	your	strategy.					
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	58			Moving	averages	in	forex	trading	(and	not	only	FX)		That	 is	 a	 common	 problem	 among	 investors.	 They	 are	 looking	 for	 best	 working	 moving	averages.	But	do	you	know	there	are	few	ways	you	can	use	moving	average	in	your	trading	plan?		Do	moving	averages	crossovers	works?	Take	ten	new	traders	and	tell	them	to	create	trading	system	and	I	am	sure	that	more	than	70%	of	 them	 will	 use	 moving	 average	 crossovers	 as	 a	 part	 of	 their	 system.	 It	 is	 not	 a	 surprise.	Moving	averages	are	one	of	the	oldest	technical	indicators.	They	are	in	use	since	20’s	of	XX	century	so	almost	100	years.	Of	course,	over	time	people	find	more	sophisticated	ways	of	using	them.	Also,	we	have	many	more	types	of	averages,	but	the	concepts	behind	creating	them	are	still	similar.		But	do	they	work?	From	the	beginning	of	using	ma’s	traders	were	trying	to	find	profitable	crossover	signals.	You	may	be	familiar	with	concept	such	as	Golden	Cross	and	Death	Cross.	But	there	is	no	one	simple	answer	 to	 the	 question.	 When	 there	 is	 a	 strong	 trend	 then	 signals	 from	 moving	 average	crossovers	work	great:	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	59			strong	down	trend	and	good	sell	signals	from	average	crossovers		When	there	is	no	clear	direction	–	the	market	is	moving	sideways	or	what’s	worse	is	very	choppy,	then	quality	of	buy	and	sell	signals	from	moving	averages	is	very	low:	
	no	clear	trend	and	many	false	signals	from	crossovers	
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	60		So	it	depends	more	from	the	way	you	are	going	to	use	averages	–	does	your	trading	plan	takes	such	a	scenario	into	an	account?		But	wait,	there	is	another	way	of	using	moving	averages	I	started	from	crossovers	topic	because	many	new	traders	think	that	this	is	the	main	way	of	using	them.	They	are	wrong.	Below	you	can	find	few	examples	how	you	can	use	averages	in	different	ways.			Moving	average	as	a	trend	detector	You	simply	take	longer	time	frame	and	observe	where	the	price	is.	So,	in	the	example	below	we	are	looking	at	200	moving	average.	When	price	is	above	that	average	then	that	is	a	signal	for	us	that	the	overall	trend	is	up:	
	price	above	200	moving	average	
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	61		When	price	is	sitting	back	below	average	for	most	of	the	time,	then	it’s	sign	that	sellers	are	stronger	now:	
	price	below	200	moving	average			What	is	the	direction	of	average?	You	should	also	pay	attention	at	what	direction	moving	average	is	pointing.	If	it’s	pointing	up,	then	there	are	better	chances	that	trend	up	will	continue.	When	it’s	pointing	down	then	it	is	possible,	that	there	is	a	correction	taking	a	place	or	down	trend	will	continue	to	expand.			
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	62		Is	price	crossing	through	moving	average?	This	 is	 also	 a	 valid	 signal.	 When	 price	 for	 most	 of	 the	 time	 was	 right	 below	 average	 and	suddenly	is	crossing	through	to	the	other	side	than	it	is	a	sign	that	overall	sentiment	may	be	changing	like	in	the	example	below:	
	price	crossing	through	average			Moving	average	as	a	support	or	resistance	That	is	a	very	important	function.	Some	averages	are	commonly	used	by	traders,	for	example	50,	100	or	200	averages.	They	are	very	popular	and	when	price	is	moving	near	them	then	you	can	expect	reaction.	If	price	was	most	of	the	time	above	average,	it	is	possible	that	there	will	be	support.	Check	the	example	below:	
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	63			support	at	50,	100	and	200	averages	On	the	other	hand,	if	the	price	is	below	averages	and	is	moving	closer	to	them,	then	it	is	possible	that	averages	will	work	as	a	resistance	area.	As	you	already	know,	knowledge	about	possible	support	and	resistance	areas	is	very	worthy.	You	can	write	this	into	your	trading	plan	and	close	trades	at	better	moments.		How	many	averages	should	you	use?	It	depends	strongly	from	trader	and	trading	style.	For	beginners,	I	suggest	to	put	on	chart	at	least	one	average	from	each	group.	We	can	divide	averages	in	three	main	groups:	• Short-term	group	–	averages	from	around	1	to	20.	They	are	helpful	when	you	want	to	check	the	current	short-term	trend.		• Medium	term	group	–	with	averages	from	around	20	to	50.		• Long	term	group	–	averages	from	period	from	50	up.	With	long	term	averages	you	can	see	better	the	bigger	picture.		Periods	may	be	different	for	some	traders.	The	values	from	above	are	there	to	give	you	some	idea	about	scope	of	each	group.	So,	you	just	want	to	have	one	average	from	short-term	group,	one	from	medium	and	one	from	long	term	group.	You	may	create	set	like:	• 10,	50,	200		• 5,	33,	100		• 7,	21,	200		• any	other	combination		
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	64		I	think	that	the	good	start	is	to	use	13,	50	and	200	moving	average.	
	13,	55,	and	200	moving	averages	on	eur/usd	chart	Test	it	and	see	which	one	is	the	best	for	your	trading	plan.			Other	tools	based	on	averages		There	 are	 many	 trading	 strategies	 based	 on	 averages.	 Most	 popular	 use	 of	 averages	 are	Rainbow	Moving	Averages	and	GMMA.	Let’s	have	a	closer	look.	Rainbow	chart	Rainbow	chart	is	very	popular;	you	can	find	it	in	many	trading	platforms.	If	there	is	no	Rainbow	chart,	then	you	can	build	it	by	yourself.	How?	Rainbow	is	usually	constructed	from	moving	averages	with	period	range	2	–	200.	It	may	be	something	like	averages	2,	3,	4,	5,	6,	7,	8,	9,	10,	11,	12,	13,	14,	15	…	and	so	on.	For	averages	from	higher	groups	distance	is	wider,	that	is	why	in	last	group	we	have	125,	130,	135…	Or	if	you	need	numbers	for	all	rainbow	averages,	here	you	go:		
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	65		2,	3,	4,	5,	6,	7,	8,	9,	10,	11,	12,	13,	14,	15	–	1st	group		17,	19,	21,	23,	25,	27,	29,	31,	33,	35,	37,	39,	41	–	2nd	group	44,	47,	40,	53,	56,	59,	62,	65,	68,	71,	74	–	3rd	group	78,	82,	86,	90,	94,	98,	102,	106,	110,	114,	118,	122	–	4th	group	125,	130,	135,	140,	145,	150,	155,	160,	165,	170,	175,	180,	185,	190,	195,	200	–	5th	group		Usually	they	are	divided	into	4	or	5	groups.	You	may	have	for	example	groups	like:	Averages	2	to	15	–	red	color	Averages	17	to	41	–	yellow	color	Averages	44	to	74	–	green	color	Averages	78	to	122	–	blue	color	Averages	125	to	200	–	violet	color	Or	you	can	use	different	colors,	they	are	here	only	to	separate	visually	each	group.				You	can	use	type	of	averages	which	is	best	for	you.	I	use	in	most	cases	exponential	averages	or	linear	weighted	averages.						Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	66				The	idea	behind	Rainbow	You	can	see	that	this	is	a	simple	tool.	It	helps	you	to	check	current	situation.	Obviously,	this	is	a	tool	for	traders	who	want	to	trade	with	trends.	With	Rainbow	tool,	they	see	current	trend.	Also,	there	is	an	information	about	support	and	resistance	areas.	Wide	Rainbow	means	that	support	/	resistance	is	strong,	narrow	that	it	may	be	weak.		Range	moves	Like	other	tools	which	help	with	catching	trends	and	it	is	great	with	that.	As	always,	problem	is	with	range	moves.	There	is	a	big	risk	that	you	will	overtrade	when	there	is	no	clear	trend	in	place.	In	situations	like	this	you	will	notice	that	Rainbow	is	narrow	and	it	is	changing	directions	a	lot.	Like	in	the	example	below:		
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	67				You	can	see	right	away	that	Rainbow	is	rather	flat	and	price	is	moving	up	and	down.	Thing	with	range	moves	is	that	it	is	rather	hard	to	spot	them	in	the	beginning.	After	a	while,	like	in	chart	above	you	know	that	you	are	dealing	with	range	move.	Before	that	it	is	not	so	obvious.		It	 comes	 with	 practice.	 Check	 higher	 time	frames,	 use	 trend	 lines	 so	 you	 have	 better	understanding	of	current	situation.	Rainbow	and…	From	 my	 experience	 with	 Rainbow	 tool	 I	 can	 tell	 that	 it	 is	 best	 to	 join	 them	 with	 other	indicators.	For	example	you	may	build	you	r	strategy	around	Rainbow	and	MACD,	you	can	add	also	Pivot	lines.	Below	you	can	see	Rainbow	with	two	Ichimoku	Kijun	Sen	lines	(Kijun	set	to	26	and	60)	and	Pivot	points.		
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	68				You	can	mix	Rainbow	with	other	trading	tools	you	like	most.	Overall,	in	my	opinion	Rainbow	can	be	very	powerful	when	joined	with	other	tools	with	good	trading	strategy.

We	can	see	that	longest	averages	gropup	(violet)	is	still	wide	in	this	place,	like	other	groups.	This	is	not	a	good	place	to	go	short.	You	can	close	position	here	but	it	looks	like	trend	is	up.	Situation	like	this	is	not	rare	and	with	help	of	Rainbow	you	can	trade	in	right	direction	and	you	can	avoid	trading	against	main	trend.	Later	we	can	see	that	blue	Kijun	line	crossed	again	with	second	Kijun	and	EUR/USD	moved	higher	–	this	was	a	good	point	to	go	long	again.

		On	this	30m	GBP/JPY	chart	we	have	Rainbow,	two	Kijun	lines,	daily	Pivots	and	oscillators.	You	can	see	that	break	below	support	was	a	start	for	a	strong	move	down.	You	could	enter	at	the	break	(because	earlier	trend	was	also	down	and	it	was	a	correction	up)	or	wait	for	reenter	later.	This	is	a	good	example	that	Rainbow	is	trend	indicator	(we	know	how	strong	is	trend,	direction)	and	longer	Kijun	line	is	our	trailing	stoploss	line.	Thanks	to	that	you	can	maximize	profits	from	your	trades,	because	you	will	stay	in	trade	as	long	as	possible.

Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	72		GMMA	GMMA	is	another	tool	based	on	moving	averages.	It	was	introduced	by	Australian	trader	Daryl	Guppy.	He	is	using	it	in	stock	market	but	it	works	great	in	Forex.	Like	Rainbow	it	is	best	to	join	GMMA	with	other	tools.	Construction	of	GMMA	We	have	two	groups	of	moving	averages:	3,	5,	8,	10,	12,	15	–	this	group	represents	short	term	traders	30,	35,	40,	45,	50,	55,	60	–	this	group	represents	long	term	traders	
		You	can	build	in	by	yourself	in	Metatrader.	I	used	MA	in	color	indicator	which	you	can	easily	install	in	your	MT4	platform.	It	allows	you	to	have	3	colors	for	each	average;	different	for	move	up,	move	down	and	range	move.	In	the	chart	above	you	can	see	that	during	a	correction	move	colors	changed	to	blue	and	light	blue,	then	after	a	while	back	to	brown	and	red.		You	can	use	type	of	averages	which	is	best	for	you.	I	use	in	most	cases	exponential	averages	or	linear	weighted	averages.			
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	73		Main	goal	of	GMMA	–	how	to	use	it	When	price	moves,	we	have	main	trend	and	short	term	moves	(correction).	Long	term	traders	want	to	profit	from	the	main	trend.	Short	term	traders	want	to	profit	from	this	short	moves.	Each	group	has	different	goals,	but	when	you	join	this	two	groups	together	you	can	see	what	is	going	on	right	now	with	the	market.		You	can	use	it	to	decide	about	trade	direction.	When	each	group	is,	wide	and	separated	from	each	other,	trend	is	strong.	If	not,	it	is	possibly	good	idea	to	wait	for	situation	to	be	clear.	More	in	trade	examples.			Problems	with	GMMA	Like	 Rainbow,	 GMMA	 is	 great	 in	 trending	 markets	 but	 can	 be	 dangerous	 when	 market	 is	moving	in	a	range.	There	are	signals	that	we	might	have	a	range	market	–	averages	will	be	close	 to	 each	 other;	 short	 term	 group	 will	 oscillate	 around	 long	 term	 group.	 Like	 in	 the	example:	
		It	is	a	good	to	check	other	time	frames,	draw	support	and	resistance	lines,	use	longer	averages	(200	period	long)	so	you	can	avoid	trading	in	such	market	conditions.

Logic	is	the	same	–	you	draw	trend	lines	and	wait	for	a	breakout.	Thanks	to	the	GMMA	lines,	you	place	a	trade	according	to	the	direction	of	main	trend.

Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	77		PART	3.	MONEY	AND	POSITION	MANAGEMENT			How	to	set	stop	loss	in	forex	trading		This	is	the	most	common	problem	among	traders.	How	to	set	stop	loss	to	protect	position	but	not	to	be	stopped	out	too	soon?	The	good	news	is	that	setting	stop	losses	with	Fibonacci	trading	tools	is	easier.	In	this	article	you	can	read	about	basics	of	setting	stop	losses	and	some	more	advanced	tips.	Should	you	use	stop	loss	orders?	Lately	I’ve	read	few	opinions	that	using	stop	losses	is	bad.	I	am	not	going	to	fight	with	everybody	here.	If	some	pro	trader	thinks	that	stop	losses	are	not	necessary	then	it	is	his	choice.	If	he	makes	money,	that	is	good.	But	if	you	are	a	new	investor,	struggling	to	close	a	year	with	a	profit,	than	using	stop	losses	is	necessary.	Let’s	say	it	clear	and	loud:	stop	losses	are	not	perfect.	It	is	not	something	that	will	make	you	rich	or	profitable	trader.	It	is	also	not	something	100%	accurate.	You	set	your	stop	losses	and	your	stop	losses	are	as	good	as	good	trader	you	are.	Why	stop	losses	are	good?	Stop	losses	are	good	because	they	protect	you	from	your	grid	and	impulsive	decisions.	How	many	times	have	you	waited	too	long	to	close	the	losing	trade?	You	were	hoping	that	this	is	only	a	correction	and	in	a	minute	buyers	will	come	back.	Emotions	are	your	worst	advisor.	You	cannot	turn	them	off	totally,	but	you	can	work	on	minimalizing	their	impact	on	your	trading.	Stop	loss	order	is	one	of	the	tools	which	may	help	you	to	achieve	that.		Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	78		The	idea	of	stop	loss	The	 idea	 of	 good	 stop	 loss	 placing	 is	 to	 help	 you	 keep	 your	 losses	 small	 and	 avoid	emotions	taking	control	over	your	decisions.	This	way	you	can	have	three	losing	trades	in	a	row,	but	your	loss	together	from	these	three	trades	won’t	be	such	a	big.	The	next	trade	may	be	much	more	profitable.	Let’s	look	at	example.		John	wants	to	buy	200	shares	of	YYY	Company	at	12$.	He	is	willing	to	risk	1.2$	on	each	share.	He	has	a	good	feeling	about	this	company	and	his	trading	plan	gives	him	a	green	light.	He	bought	it	and	two	days	later	he	was	stopped	out.	His	lost	was	1.2$x200	shares	=	240$.	Next	day	he	decides	to	enter	other	trade.	There	was	a	breakout	on	VVV	chart.	He	buys	80	shares	at	20$	and	set	his	stop	loss	1.5$	lower.	In	the	beginning	it	looks	good,	but	suddenly	there	is	a	rumor	about	YYY	problems	and	shares	start	to	fall.	He	was	stopped	out.	His	loss	is	1.5$x80	shares	=	120$.	He	is	not	happy	about	that,	but	he	is	looking	at	other	opportunities.	He	has	few	possible	candidates,	but	he	decided	to	wait	for	another	confirmation	from	his	trading	plan.	Few	days	later	there	is	a	confirmation	signal	on	HHH	Company’s	chart.	He	buys	50	shares	for	42$	and	sets	his	stop	at	38.5$.	There	is	not	too	much	action	next	days,	 but	 eventually	 stock	 starts	 to	 move	 up.	In	next	few	weeks	HHH	goes	up	to	52$	and	John	decide	to	close	the	trade,	because	there	is	a	strong	resistance	near	that	level.	He	closes	position	at	52$	and	his	profit	is	50	shares	x	(52$-42$)	=	500$.	On	previous	two	trades	he	has	lost	360$,	so	his	profit	is	500$-360$=140$.	Ok,	he	is	not	reach,	but	it	is	not	so	bad.	But	what	if	his	losses	from	previous	trades	were	bigger?	Then	he	still	would	be	trying	to	earn	back	his	money.		Example	is	simple,	but	I	hope	that	you	get	the	main	idea.	That	is	a	life	of	investors.	You	will	be	stopped	out.	Your	goal	is	to	look	for	profitable	trades	and	thanks	to	them	earn	money	for	profit	and	to	cover	your	losses.					Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	79		Risk/ratio	reward	There	 is	 a	 very	 popular	 goal	 to	 keep	 your	 risk/reward	 ratio	 at	 1:2	 or	 even	 1:3	proportions.	That	means	that	trader	is	willing	to	risk	for	example	2$	per	share	and	expect	to	earn	4$	per	share	(1:2)	or	6$	(1:3).	If	the	risk/reward	ratio	is	around	1:1,	they	do	not	enter	a	trade	because	it	is	not	worth	that	risk.		Risk/reward	description	is	a	good	topic	for	another	article.	For	now	let’s	stay	with	the	risk	part.	Experienced	traders,	who	are	looking	for	good	opportunities,	know	where	to	put	stop.	They	do	not	enter	a	trade	and	then	wonder:	“Hmm,	maybe	here	will	be	a	good	place	for	stop	loss”.	They	basically	know	that	when	they	think	about	entering	a	trade,	because	they	are	looking	for	good	risk/reward	ratio.	Keep	that	in	mind.	When	to	set	stop	losses?	The	best	practice	is	to	set	stop	loss	in	the	same	time	you	are	placing	your	order.	You	should	know	in	advance	where	you	want	to	set	your	stop	loss.	When	you	are	placing	your	order,	you	set	stop	loss	right	way.	Why?	Because	later	you	are	probably	going	to	hesitate	to	place	SL.	You	might	also	place	it	in	a	wrong	place,	because	of	emotions.	Where	should	you	set	stop	loss?		It	is	hard	to	answer	in	few	words,	but	there	are	some	good	rules	you	can	follow.	Before	we	review	them,	let’s	learn	more	about	two	most	common	mistakes.		Mistake	1:	Placing	stop	too	tight.		When	stop	loss	is	set	too	tight	then	there	is	a	strong	chance	that	you	will	be	stopped	at	first	bigger	move	or	stop	hunt.	Markets	are	very	volatile	today	and	it	is	easy	to	be	stopped	 out	 when	 your	 stop	is	 too	 close.	I’ve	noticed	that	this	happens	to	traders	who	do	not	want	to	lose	too	much	money.	Because	stop	loss	is	very	near	the	entry	point,	when	it	gets	triggered,	loss	on	account	Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	80		is	small.	The	main	problem	is	that	tight	stop	losses	get	triggered	very	often.	Soon	you	have	dozens	of	small	losses	which	altogether	are	one	huge	loss	on	your	account.			Mistake	2:	Placing	stop	too	wide.		Nobody	likes	to	be	stopped	out	from	a	trade.	Some	traders	place	their	stop	losses	very	wide	to	avoid	that.	They	do	not	want	to	be	caught	during	stop	hunting	or	correction.	Wide	 stop	 losses	 are	 triggered	 rarely,	 but	 when	 it	 happens	–	loss	 is	 very	 big.	On	some	occasion	that	works,	but	on	many	times	they	are	eventually	stopped	out	and	loss	from	that	is	very	big.		So	what	is	the	answer	here?	You	have	to	find	something	in	the	middle!	Ok,	I	know	that	this	is	not	the	answer	;).	Start	from	looking	closely	at	price	action.	If	you	have	read	my	others	articles,	you	saw	the	 next	 chart,	 but	 this	 is	 an	 answer	 for	 your	 problem.	I	assume	that	you	are	trying	to	invest	in	a	trending	market.	When	there	is	no	trend,	you	do	not	trade.	What	we	know	is	that	in	an	uptrend	we	have	a	sequence	of	higher	highs	and	higher	lows,	just	like	on	the	chart.	If	the	trend	is	strong	and	healthy,	you	can	easily	see	that	sequence	just	looking	at	the	price.	When	there	is	something	wrong	with	trend,	price	has	problem	to	make	next	high	–	sign	that	correction	is	possible.		Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	81			Setting	stop	loss	below	last	low		With	all	that	information	you	can	place	your	stop	below	last	significant	low,	when	you	are	in	a	long	position.	When	trend	is	healthy,	you	should	make	your	money.	When	trend	is	very	weak,	you	will	be	stopped	out.	It	is	a	good	thing	because	probably	the	price	will	go	even	lower	than	your	stop	loss.	It	also	works	in	a	downtrend.	You	are	simply	looking	to	place	your	stop	loss	above	last	high.		
	Placing	a	stop	loss	in	a	down	trend		
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	82		Look	at	the	logic	here.	If	price	in	a	downtrend	will	manage	to	break	above	recent	high,	then	there	is	a	strong	chance	that	buyers	are	trying	to	take	over	the	control.	You	do	not	want	to	be	short	in	that	situation.	You	want	to	close	your	position	and	look	for	other	opportunities.			Raising	stop	loss	I	am	a	huge	fan	of	that	method,	yet	many	people	do	not	use	it.	It	is	very	simple,	so	in	your	next	trades	try	to	use	it.		How	does	it	work?	You	place	your	stop	loss	when	you	are	opening	a	trade.	On	some	occasions	you	will	be	stopped	out	pretty	fast.	Other	times	trade	will	go	as	you	wanted	to.	That	is	good,	but	what	do	you	do	when	your	trade	is	profitable?	It	still	can	turn	around	and	trigger	your	stop	loss	and	from	profitable	trade	you	will	end	with	a	loss.	That	was	my	mistake	actually	for	many	years.	I	had	so	many	profitable	trades	for	a	while,	but	I	was	closing	it	with	loss.	Now	when	my	trade	is	profitable,	I	am	simply	raising	my	stop	loss	to	the	entry	point.	This	way	even	if	price	is	going	to	turn	against	my	position,	I	do	not	lose	a	single	dollar.	When	to	raise	stop	to	entry	point?	Not	as	soon	as	your	trade	is	profitable.	Just	wait	some	time	and	see	how	things	are.	You	have	to	work	out	your	own	system.	I	usually	wait	until	price	is	at	least	twice	as	far	from	entry	point	as	my	stop	loss	is.	So	in	a	trade	where	entry	position	was	at	20	and	stop	loss	set	at	18	(2$	lower	from	entry	price),	I	raise	stop	loss	to	20	as	soon	as	price	will	go	up	to	24$	(twice	as	stop	loss	so	2×2$=4$).	Sometimes	I	raise	it	earlier	–	it	really	depends	from	situation.		When	the	price	is	still	going	up,	I	am	raising	my	stop	even	further.	Why?	To	protect	my	profit.	If	price	will	fail	to	reach	my	target,	I	still	book	some	profit	from	that	trade.	It	is	called	trailing	stop,	because	your	stop	loss	is	practically	following	the	price	all	the	time.	When	price	goes	up,	so	is	your	stop	loss.	Of	course	if	price	in	an	uptrend	is	down,	you	are	not	lowering	your	stop.	There	are	many	methods	of	using	trailing	stop	loss.	You	can	watch	this	movie	below	to	see	how	some	traders	are	using	this	technique.		Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	83		1%	rule		Some	traders	are	using	2%	rule,	but	this	is	not	the	most	important	thing	about	that	rule.	1%	rule	means	that	you	can	risk	only	1%	of	your	trading	capital	on	any	single	trade.		For	example,	when	your	trading	account	is	20000$,	than	you	can	risk	20000$*1%=200$	on	any	single	trade.	Yes,	you	can	risk	only	200$	per	trade.	Many	traders	do	not	have	big	enough	accounts,	so	they	are	simply	just	ignoring	this	rule.	The	truth	is,	this	is	a	great	rule,	which	helps	you	to	survive.	Even	if	you	will	have	20	losing	trades	in	a	row,	you	still	have	more	than	half	of	money	on	your	account.	Without	that	rule,	you	would	be	probably	looking	for	money	for	your	next	account.		It	is	very	wide	topic;	I	am	going	to	write	about	this	in	separate	article.	It	is	your	decision	to	use	this	rule	or	not.	I	am	using	this	rule	and	I	can	say	that	on	many	times	it	saved	my	account.	Join	this	rule	with	good	stop	loss	placing	and	you	will	be	so	much	better	trader.		Stop	losses	with	Fibonacci	trading	When	you	are	trading	with	Fibonacci	numbers,	it	is	easy	to	use	stop	losses.		When	I	am	looking	to	enter	a	long	position,	I	wait	for	a	correction	to	the	retracement	line.	When	I	enter	after	some	confirmation	signal,	my	stop	loss	would	usually	go	below	61.8%	or	78%	line:	
	
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	84		Setting	stop	loss	below	78%	retracement	line	When	price	will	close	below	those	lines,	then	I	do	not	want	to	be	in	that	trade	because	price	should	go	up	from	these	levels,	not	below	them.	When	I	go	long	on	breakout,	then	my	stop	loss	goes	below	the	nearest	retracement	line:		
	Setting	stop	loss	with	Fibonacci	retracement	(after	breakout)	Why?	Because	I	assume	that	trend	is	strong	enough	that	last	high	was	broken,	so	price	should	go	up.	When	it	does	not,	then	probably	there	is	something	wrong	with	the	trend	or	this	is	a	false	breakout.	I	take	a	small	loss	and	wait	for	another	setup.			Conclusion	Stop	loss	placing	is	an	important	topic.	Many	traders	have	different	ways	of	doing	that.	You	should	work	on	your	trading	plan	and	practice	different	ways	of	placing	stop	losses.	It	comes	with	time,	but	it	is	worth	it	to	practice.	Stop	loss	can	be	a	great	tool	in	your	trading	and	I	hope	that	I’ve	managed	to	show	you	that	in	my	article.						
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	85		Trade	partial	close	in	Metatrader		Not	everyone	knows	that	you	can	close	part	of	a	trade	and	let	the	other	part	keep	on	running.	 I	 use	 this	 approach	 in	 Metatrader.	 If	 you	 use	 other	 trading	 software,	 you	should	check	manual.	So	how	to	close	part	of	the	trade?	It	is	simple.	First,	from	open	trades	select	trade	you	want	to	modify.	Right	click	on	it	and	click	Modify	or	Delete	Order:			
				Next	you	will	see	popup	with	options.	Make	sure	that	Type	is	set	to	Market	Execution.	In	Volume	line	select	size	of	position	you	want	to	close.	You	can	see	in	the	example	that	I	have	2.0	lots	open	on	Germany	30	Index	Cash	and	I	want	to	close	half	of	it	so	I	set	volume	to	1.0.	Next,	click	yellow	Close	button	at	the	bottom.			
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	86					This	way	you	can	close	part	of	your	trade	and	left	the	other	part	open.				Why	you	should	use	partial	close?		Every	experienced	trader	will	tell	you	that	profit	on	your	open	position	is	only	virtual.	Only	when	you	close	a	trade	and	book	profit	then	you	can	say	that	you	made	X	dollars	on	 that	 trade.	 There	 are	 many	 situations	 when	 market	 can	 turn	 around	 in	 split	 of	seconds.	If	you	trade	longer	than	few	months,	then	you	probably	saw	flash	crashes	or	some	other	strong	moves.	If	market	goes	against	you	from	nice	temporary	profit	you	can	have	a	loss.		With	partial	close	you	can	have	better	control	with	money	management	and	position	sizing.	Next,	I	show	you	some	examples	when	you	can	use	partial	close.				
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	87		Partial	close	and	stop	loss		When	you	close	part	of	your	trade	then	you	have	some	part	left	open.	So,	you	book	some	profit,	but	what	about	this	open	part?	Where	is	your	stop	loss?	It	is	always	a	good	idea	to	move	your	stop	loss	to	the	entry	point.	That	way	if	something	goes	wrong	with	that	open	part	then	you	won’t	lose	money.			When	you	can	use	partial	close?	Of	course,	in	most	cases	it	will	be	when	you	are	profitable.	You	are	not	sure	if	this	is	an	end	of	a	move	but	you	want	to	book	some	profit.		There	 are	 many	 situations	 when	 you	 can	 close	 part	 of	 your	 trade.	 Some	 examples	below.		Long	term	trading	In	long	term	trading	you	keep	your	trade	open	so	long	as	you	can.		You	may	see	signals	that	trend	is	getting	weaker.	Maybe	price	has	problems	with	some	resistance	area	and	there	is	a	range	move.	Or	price	is	approaching	very	important	level.	When	you	have	nice	profit	on	your	current	trade	it	is	a	good	idea	to	close	part	of	it.	You	can	always	reenter	trade	on	correction	move.			Resistance	areas	and	trend	reversals	There	are	levels	which	are	very	important	for	traders.	It	may	be	some	pivot	line	or	resistance	line	based	on	price	history.	Let’s	say	that	traders	are	long.	When	trade	is	in	profit,	they	set	take	profit	(TP)	order	on	R2	line.		We	also	have	trading	robots.	Programmers	know	that	around	R2	line	we	can	expect	some	sell-off	because	of	TP	orders.	They	program	robots	to	go	short	from	that	level	for	short	time	of	period.		Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	88			This	way	we	can	see	some	rapid	price	actions	near	important	levels.		If	we	are	in	profit	and	see	that	price	is	getting	closer	to	such	area,	we	can	close	part	of	trade	here.		Few	targets	What	if	trend	is	strong	and	price	can	go	to	R3	line?	When	we	use	Pivots	we	have	few	support	and	resistance	lines.	Same	thing	with	Fibonacci	–	there	are	few	extension	lines	where	traders	can	close	their	trades.	In	these	cases,	we	can	use	partial	close.		Let’s	check	the	example	chart	below	and	discuss	this	situation.		
					
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	89		On	 chart,	 you	 can	 see	 Fibonacci	 retracement	 and	 extension	 lines.	 We	 open	 short	position,	2	lots	on	EUR/USD.	Everything	goes	well,	there	is	a	strong	move	down.	We	know	from	our	experience	that	161.8%	is	often	target	for	TP	orders.	Still,	move	is	strong	and	we	have	another	good	target	at	200%	extension	line.	The	best	way	to	handle	this	situation	is	to	close	part	of	trade	at	161.8%	extension.	Next,	we	move	stop	loss	to	the	entry	point	–	that	way	even	if	price	suddenly	go	back	we	won’t	lose	any	money.	Last	thing	to	do	is	to	set	take	profit	target	for	200%	extension	line.			Of	course,	you	can	trade	with	other	system.	I	use	Fibonacci	in	example	but	you	can	have	few	targets	based	on	trend	lines	or	Pivot	lines	or	some	other	trading	technique.	The	most	important	thing	here	to	remember	is	that	you	can	manage	your	trade.	With	partial	close	you	can	protect	your	profit.	When	you	change	your	stop	loss	to	the	entry	point,	you	make	sure	that	you	won’t	lose	money.	And	part	of	the	trade	which	is	left	open	–	sometimes	it	will	work	out,	sometimes	not.															Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	90		When	to	take	profit		Taking	profits	is	very	important	:)	This	is	a	moment	when	you	book	your	profits.	Closing	a	trade	will	be	different	for	every	strategy.	In	this	part	I	will	share	some	important	thoughts	based	on	my	experience.		Signals	from	Ma’s	/	Oscillators	are	not	so	great	I	can	still	see	people	trading	with	signals	from	moving	averages	or	oscillators.	That’s	not	that	bad	thing.	I	use	them	too,	mainly	to	decide	to	enter	a	trade.	But	they	lag	and	that	is	a	bad	thing	when	you	want	to	close	trade	at	best	possible	place.	As	mentioned	before,	we	can	see	strong	moves	around	important	levels	–	traders	know	very	well	where	are	these	areas	for	current	day	or	week.		On	top	of	that	we	have	algo	trading.	When	you	are	waiting	for	a	close	signal	from	oscillator,	pros	are	already	out	of	trade.		On	the	example	below	you	can	see	5m	chart	of	EUR/USD.	Move	up	was	strong	but	it	ended	at	R1	line	(red).	If	you	look	closely	you	can	spot	long	shadows	on	candles	near	R1	line.	Price	tried	to	move	higher	but	this	was	a	strong	resistance	area.	We	can	assume	that	traders	used	this	level	to	close	trades	and	book	profits.	If	you	wanted	to	close	long	trade	based	on	MACD	(or	other	oscillator,	MACD	is	only	as	an	example	here)	then	you	would	be	so	late	with	your	decisions.	Same	situation	is	with	moving	averages,	look	how	late	average	cross	was.		Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	91				Pivot	points	are	very	important		I	wrote	more	about	Pivot	points	earlier	in	this	guide.	You	can	build	the	whole	trading	strategy	 around	 Pivot	 points.	 You	 can	 also	 use	 other	 strategy	 but	 still	 use	 them	 to	decide	when	to	close	a	trade.		The	great	thing	about	Pivot	points	is	that	we	have	many	types	of	PP	based	on	time	frame.	So	we	have:		
Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	92		Lower	than	daily	–	for	example	hourly,	4h	and	so	on.

You	trade	long	term?	 Then	 weekly	 or	 monthly	 pivots	 will	 be	 a	 good	 addition	 to	 your	 trading.	Daytrader?	Then	you	have	daily	Pivots	and	lower.				How	to	use	Pivot	points	to	close	a	trade	The	middle	line	is	pivot.	Above	pivot	we	have	resistance	lines,	below	are	support	lines.	In	most	cases,	we	want	to	have	on	chart	lines	from	1	to	3	so	S1,	S2,	S3,	R1,	R2,	R3.	You	can	calculate	more	levels	like	R4,	R5,	S4,	S5	but	it	is	very	rare	to	use	them.		The	most	important	lines	are	2s	–	R2,	S2.	Of	course,	price	can	stop	at	any	level,	but	many	traders	will	confirm	that	on	many	times	R2	and	S2	lines	are	targets	for	traders.	That	is	why	when	price	is	near	S2	or	R2	it	is	a	good	idea	to	close	a	trade	or	to	close	part	of	trade.			Sometimes	trend	will	be	strong	and	price	can	move	through	second	line	to	the	third	line	(S3	or	R3.	I	can	tell	from	my	experience	–	in	that	situation	set	take	profit	target	at	third	line.	When	it	is	hit,	close	trade	and	end	trading	:).			Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	93		I	had	times	when	it	looked	like	Armageddon	–	trend	down	was	so	strong.	I	saw	that	there	was	S3	was	in	place	but	I	ignored	it	and	kept	position	open,	hoping	for	move	down.	In	most	cases	S3	worked,	price	went	back	above	that	level.	Similar	story	with	R3	line.		It	is	very	rare	for	price	to	move	behind	third	line	–	of	course	there	may	be	some	political	or	economic	news.	In	that	case	price	ignore	important	levels	because	we	have	mass	orders.	But	these	are	exceptions.	Trust	me	when	I	say	from	my	experience	that	S3	/	R3	line	is	your	last	target	when	you	should	have	profit	which	is	good	enough.				Let’s	check	some	examples:		On	chart	below	we	have	1-hour	GBP/JPY	with	weekly	Pivot	Points.	You	can	see	that	uptrend	was	strong,	but	two	weeks	in	a	row	move	ended	at	R3	line.	Even	in	strong	trend	R3	/	S3	line	are	respected,	traders	want	to	cash	profit	and	in	situations	like	this	they	do	it	at	third	line.	There	is	no	hoping	for	more	or	some	wishful	thinking.

				Fibonacci	works	great	too		Fibonacci	extension	lines	are	great	when	it	comes	to	set	profit	target.		There	is	one	disadvantage	with	this	method.	You	should	know	how	to	draw	Fibonacci	lines	on	chart.	With	Pivots	there	is	a	different	story	–	lines	are	calculated	based	on	formula	so	there	is	no	guessing.	On	the	other	hand	trading	with	Fibonacci	is	not	that	hard	so	it	is	good	to	learn	how	to	use	them.

Forex	trading	for	beginners	–	tutorial	by	Comparic.com	|	97		Trading	journal		We	talked	about	stop	loss,	taking	profit.	There	is	one	more	important	thing	we	should	talk	about	when	it	comes	to	position	management.	Yes,	trading	journal.	You	see,	this	guide	should	help	you	to	learn	how	to	trade	Forex.	You	should	know	your	mistakes	and	learn	from	them.	My	biggest	mistake	in	first	years	of	trading	was	not	to	run	a	trading	journal.	I	started	few	times,	but	I	was	too	lazy	to	keep	it	running.	In	the	end,	I	struggled	to	be	profitable.	Then	 I	 started	 journal	 in	 form	 of	 spreadsheet.	 It	 was	 ok.	 Beside	 info	 such	 as	 entry,	 exit,	profit/loss	it	has	information	about	trading	signals.	But…	I	am	not	strict	mechanical	trader.	I	use	trading	signals,	but	I	also	analyze	the	current	market	situation,	higher	time	frames	and	many	other	things.	There	is	better	way	to	run	your	trading	diary.	Write	it	down	in	a	notebook.	I	saw	on	twitter	that	few	of	traders	which	I	follow	do	that.	They	keep	diary	in	form	of	notebook.	They	describe	trade,	what	was	the	current	situation,	how	did	it	look	from	technical	analysis	perspective.	Later	they	write	how	it	ended.	Or	they	simply	write	new	things	they	have	learned.		I	believe	this	is	the	best	way	to	do	it.	Thanks	to	that	description	you	can	also	write	what	you	were	 thinking,	 what	 was	 the	 main	 motivation	 to	 take	 the	 trade.

Problem statement The purpose of this project is to build a trading system that uses scientific methods to ensure profitability. Creating a science-based trading system allows for an investor to design a trading system and portfolio using logic rather than emotion. This creates a trading strategy that can keep a trader from making costly mistakes that usually arise from relying on their intuition and “gut” feelings. Because asset traders are humans and not computers, they have emotions that can prevent them from making smart trades, even if they are experienced traders and know when to make a trade.  1.2. Importance of problem The reliability of using logical criteria to create trades is one reason that professional stock market traders use quantitative trading. By using quantitative trading, traders can make better trades, which are based on scientific and statistical knowledge. Thus, an algorithmic trading system designed to trade on objective criteria prevents these emotions from ruining a trader’s portfolio. Therefore, this project involved creating an automatic trading system designed to run on the trading platform TradeStation.  Methods including statistical analysis and mathematical modeling are implemented in order to fully optimize the trading system for use in the stock market. In this project, it is proven that scientific analysis is an efficient method for analyzing and writing trading programs. In addition, when the trading system is properly written and tested, the advantages of automatic trading outweigh the disadvantages of manual trading for multiple reasons. These include, but are not limited to: prevention of user error, trading consistency, and proven trading methods. Statistically-backed information is utilized in the program to decide when to create trades, and this reduces errors caused by human interference and bias. Often times, being unsure of a trade causes people to make bad choices that result in losing money. In addition, relying on manual trading is a strategy that is prone to user forgetfulness and unreliability. By trading automatically through computer programs, emotions can no longer interfere with trades since the system relies on math and scientific  5 objective criteria to trade (Folger). These criteria, of course, have been determined to be statistically likely to accomplish the trader's goals. Also, trades traded by an automatic system will always be ordered to the stock broker, since the computer program cannot accidentally forget about the trade. Lastly, automatically trading is a strategy that can be built and improved upon over time, with little effort. 1.3. Literature summary and statement of creativity For the automatic trading system, stocks were traded in swing trading time frames. Two algorithmic strategies were written and back tested with historical data, and both strategies were combined into two "system of systems" that allowed analysis of the portfolio of stocks. These two strategies were based on: 1) Trend-following resistance and support trendline charts 2) Moving Average crossover philosophies.  Additionally, analytical techniques such as Monte Carlo analysis and Walk Forward Optimization were used to determine the allocation of funds to each stock inside of a "system of systems" portfolio. The purpose of a dual “system of systems” is to build a reliably profitable strategy for creating funds. By allocating money to each of the two systems depending on the potential expected reward gained, the entire strategy can be depended upon to create funds regardless on the individual stocks in the system or the economic performance of the market. Also, adapting the allocation of money and importance to both systems allows the “weight” of the entire “system of systems” to be calculated and optimized. In both systems, the strategy made use of a unique stock selection method known as the “CANSLIM” method, which chooses strongly performing stocks to trade (Chen, CANSLIM). This stock selection, in tandem with the technical analysis chart trading method of using trendline support and resistance lines, is best used for trading during times of rapidly changing prices over the course of weeks and months of slow price increases. The price level reaches one of the resistance or support lines when a sharp price change happens, and this is exploited in this strategy, by finding this sharp changes.  The use of support and resistance lines is implemented in a trend-following system for the first of the two systems. A trend following system is a trading system in which trades are created that effectively  6 use the price level movement of a stock as a way to gauge when trades should be made. When the price is predicted by the system to increase, then the trend following strategy will purchase the stock. Likewise, when the system predicts the system will decrease, then the system will sell the stock that was previously purchased. This trendfollowing method a common method used by traders. The second system conducts trades based on a moving average cross-over strategy, in tandem with a trend following system, that follows the trends of the moving averages in specific to conduct trades. Two moving average lines were used, and optimized for each stock, to create a system. Using historical data, the system calculates the best time range for the fast and slow moving average lines, and creates trades when the the “fast” moving average line crosses over and under the “slow” moving average line. For the purpose of this project, the system was created on a simulated trading platform for the sake of implementing an operable code. Funds allocated by the system were not evaluated in terms of feasibility or actual implementation. Thus, commission fees and waiting periods are just two factors that must be considered before actually implementing this strategy. This code was written with my own psychological preferences, and the purpose of doing this will be included later in the paper. To briefly explain, a trader’s adversity to risk, and his/her propensity to invest and trade money, will be an important factor in how they decide to conduct trades.   1.4. Conclusions Through these analytical techniques, it was found that creating automated trading systems is a profitable venture, as using scientific methods to build and optimize trading algorithms can vastly improve results relative to solely relying on traditional methods such as chart reading.        7 Chapter 2: Trading & Investing 2.1. Trading & Investing Overview In financial management, the allocation and earning of money is done in the stock market through trading and investing strategies. These two approaches are the most commonly implemented strategies in the stock market. Traders, investors, and everyday people trade financial assets on the stock exchange for profits. Each individual person who trades must create strategies for reliable success, regardless of their mindset or preferred strategy. Trading strategies typically involve buying and selling financial assets more frequently than an investing strategy. This is done by exploiting the changes in price of an asset class, and purchasing, selling these asset classes to make profit. This is done, usually, by holding and then selling an asset in the time frame of anywhere from a few nanoseconds to months to even multiple years. Various time frames appeal to various mindsets, and these will be discussed in further detail in Chapter 3. The mindset of traders is short term profits with minimized risk of losing out on money-making opportunities in the short term. In addition, traders prefer to use the price level of an asset class as indication of trading potential rather than an individual asset's financial performance. Also, traders are not interested in an assets performance or purpose, instead focusing on how to take advantage of the changes in price of its shares in order to make profitable trades. Trading assets brings the advantages and disadvantages that arise from holding onto assets for short periods of time. For instance, a trader does not necessarily have to watch the company’s performance in the news, and can trade any asset that has large price movement. In addition, traders can get out of a bad trade quickly, because their money is not held up. However, trading in short term strategies has disadvantages as well. Trading assets frequently requires commission costs paid to stock brokers, which usually cannot be ignored in real life. Unless a trader is a stock broker, or has a close relationship with their stock broker, they must pay commission costs that make it possible for their stock broker to also make money. Commission costs not only lower a  8 trader’s profitability, but also forces traders to create strategies that are profitable in order to make money. Without a sound trading system, a trader cannot rely on their system to make money.  Investors, in comparison, are more inclined to having long term approaches in buying and selling. Investing strategies often involve researching an asset class such as a company’s stock to predict the future stock price level. Researching the company’s financial statements, its management, and also keeping track of the company’s performance are ways that investors track a stock to decide whether to buy, hold, or sell a stock. Investors have the, “buying and holding” mentality for long periods of time, and observing changes in the market and industry rather than focusing on the price level of a stock. Also, investors make use of dividends, money paid out to stockholders, to earn money. By holding onto stock for long amounts of time, the investor can earn money from both selling the stock at advantageous times and also from dividends. Similarly to trading strategies, there are advantages and disadvantages that come with investing strategies. Since these strategies are run on a longer time frame, less trades are being made when compared to a trading strategy. For this reason, commission costs associated with stock brokers is lower for investors than for traders. In addition, investors do not have to keep their attention on price fluctuations, since an intelligent investor will have a strategy for selecting strong stocks that are ensured to perform well in the long run. This, however, can bring disadvantages. For instance, investors keep their money held up in an asset far longer than traders, and can miss out on potential profits if they wait too long on an unsuccessful investment. In addition, investors must pay more attention to how an asset is doing, relative to its competitors or alternatives. Keeping an eye on the fundamental analysis indicators is important for investors for this reason. Watching trends and looking out for potential catalysts of price movement is more important to an investor than just watching the price level exclusively. Investors and traders have different mentalities with respect to earning money on the stock market, and these differences bring their own advantages and disadvantages. Differences in one’s risk  9 averse and one’s willingness to watch individual assets for long periods of time are the biggest differences between the two mindsets. 2.2 Stock Market and "Beating the Market" Independently of trading and investing mindsets, is the idea of whether or not is it beneficial to attempt individually “beating” the market or if focusing on “traveling” with the market is more advantageous. “Beating” the market in this case refers to individuals who attempt earning higher average returns than the “market,” or the large stock market indexes such as the Dow Jones or S&P 500. The agreed upon annual return rate for these indexes is around 5-10%. Strategies that attempt earning larger rates than these are more aggressive, and often more risky than the alternative. Many individuals, historically, have found it possible to “beat” the market. By creating unique strategies and taking full advantage of volatility and irrational behavior, these strategies are commonly used. Robert Shiller, a 2009 Nobel laureate in Economics, was an early proponent of this idea of systematically beating the market (Shiller 421-436). Shiller noticed inefficiencies in the market, which he discovered were largely due to emotional rather than rational mindsets. Because asset holders overreact to changes in the market, those with good strategies can predict and make use of these overreactions. However, this idea was not commonly accepted until Shiller wrote about behavioral finance, and discussed inefficiencies in the market. Up until then, the efficient market hypothesis was commonly accepted as the model for economic and trading behavior. This hypothesis, in contrast to Shiller’s ideas of behavioral finance, assumed that all market participants make rational choices in the market (Fama). This idea believes that stock prices are indicative of the average expectation for the stock’s price, and that this price accurately gauges the price, at which an individual cannot exploit the market for their own gain. Thus, this theory, developed by Eugene Fama, implies that investing in individual stocks is a poor idea, and that investments in index funds is more likely to earn consistent profits  These various theories about market efficiency are congruent with the practices that abide by the principles that constitute them. Not only are the practices opposite in principle, but they are  10 interconnected in their analysis of price level action of assets. The aggressive behavioral finance proponents make trades that the efficient market proponents believe set the appropriate price level.  Both theories and practices are not the only ideologies about market behavior, since any individual trader can create their own hypotheses about the market and its inefficiencies. Individual traders can be educated on trading methods through independent research as well as through formal education such as college. As a trader self-educates himself/herself through actual trades, they begin to notice patterns in the market cycle and in price level action. One of the repeating patterns in an asset’s price level, if the asset is a stock of a company, is the well hidden buying and selling of shares in the company by large financial institutions. Banks, hedge funds, investment firms, and other companies with large budgets and experienced, intelligent employees guide the price level of a stock through buying and trading (Accumulation). These institutions do this through allocating large amounts of money into shares of an asset, and building up their reserves of stock while the price is still low.  These patterns and underlying trading motives are the core of an assets price, and consequently are also the building blocks of stock market price movement. Since the stock market is comprised of all of the publicly sold stocks, the large financial institutions that manipulated the price level have significant influence on the stock market. Stock prices are set by investors who calculated the supply and demand of an asset, and thus the price at which the shares can be sold. Shares of a company are sold as very small percentages of ownership. Publicly traded companies sell shares of their company in order to gain revenue for the operation of their company, or simply for profit. Privately traded companies can go public, and sell their shares publicly through the stock exchange in their Initial Public Offering (IPO). When this occurs, the shares are then sold on stock exchanges, such as, but not limited to, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.  These two stock exchanges are two of the most famous and influential in the world, and are both headquartered in New York City. Not only do companies trade shares of assets on the stock exchange, but individual traders as well as trading firms also conduct trades. The prices of the stocks in the stock exchange are determined by market supply and demand. In order for traders and financial institutions to  11 analyze stock prices, they use stock market indices in order to infer whether the market is optimistic or pessimistic.  2.3 Bull and Bear markets During a bull market, trading and investing is done more frequently because the market is optimistic about the future. When the demand for an asset rises, relative to its supply, the price also rises. An example of a bull market is the post-Great Recession U.S economy, in which stock prices in the S&P 500 have risen. In addition, because more shares are being sold, the total amount, or the shares supplied decreases. When the supply of an asset decreases, the price also increases. This continues as a positive feedback loop, creating higher price stocks.  When a company’s stock price is high, they may decide to issue, or sell, more shares of their company in order to gain revenue. The company then has more money to spend on production, research, or other ways to improve their business. This is beneficial to the company, and individuals who have ownership of shares.  During a bull market, a company’s stock share may not increase in value. If a company operates poorly, such as with a bad management team, or sells an obsolete product or service, then investors will be less likely to purchase shares of the company. In addition, negative media attention for a company can also drive its stock price to decrease. For instance, when a Tesla combusted due to a faulty battery, media attention to the event drove its share price down (Hanley) . Because investors believe the company will become less popular, and will receive less customers, then they will also believe other investors will also believe the same thing, and thus many investors will sell their shares to get rid of an asset they believe will depreciate in value.  Traders can take advantage of these large drops in price, and “short sell” the stock’s shares. Short selling a stock share is when the share is borrowed, and then sold without money being exchanged. The strategy of short selling is to sell the borrowed share when the price is relatively high, and then once the price has dropped, purchase the share in order to repay the debt.   12 When the market, and the economy, are doing well, and people are optimistic about their future, these people tend to be less conservative with money and more willing to invest and make trades. This is known, in trading, as a “Bull market”. The reason for this is a bull attacks with his horns in an upward motion, and his horns are compared to the price level graph which indicates rising price. On the other hand, the opposite of a bull market is a bear market. This is when the market and the economy is doing poorly, and individuals are more conservative with their money and thus are more skeptical about trading and investing. This is typical of recessions, and downtrending markets. Bear markets get their name from a bear who attacks downwards with his claws, similarly to how price levels go down in a bull market.  2.4 Asset classes The four main asset classes that can be traded in the stock market by traders are: equities, bonds, currencies, and futures contracts. Each asset class has its own advantages and disadvantages that can be useful to exploit depending on a trader's mentality.  Equities are the asset class that is the focus of this project, and these are stocks of a publicly traded company. The value of these assets is typically determined by the performance of the company. Stock allocation is how ownership of a company is divided. The owner and directors and a company issue stocks in order to raise money for the company. These assets are traded on the stock market by traders. The advantage of trading equities such as stocks is the high amount of liquidity that allows traders to purchase and sell stock shares quickly. However, stocks that have been owned for a year or less are taxed more heavily than those owned for more than a year. Additionally, stock trading does not require large amounts of margin to trade. With online brokerages such as Robinhood or TDAmeritrade, it is easy for beginner traders to trade with relatively small amounts of money. However, some brokerage accounts require larger amounts of margin, to pay for the benefits of using the superior brokerage firm. Margin is a loan that a brokerage account can give out.  Another asset class is the bond market. Bonds are debts from the U.S Treasury that are paid to an investor, with interest added. The advantage of purchasing bonds is the promise of being repaid the set amount agreed upon during purchase. The U.S Treasury always pays its bond payments back, which  13 makes it a reliable investment. However, the rate of return on trading bonds is lower than that of trading stock shares. This gives the trader a longer term, more stable investment. Bonds can be purchased with relatively small amounts of money, and typically, United States government bonds are purchased by investors. A disadvantage of investing in bonds is the tax rate is similar to that of stock trading.  Next, currency trading or FOREX trading is an asset class that is used by many traders and investors. This is done by purchasing or shorting foreign currencies to exploit the currency-pair market. FOREX trading is similar to stock trading, in that the shares have high liquidity and thus trades are fairly frequent. In addition, both FOREX and stock trading come with additional fees. Purchasing foreign currencies typically requires a small fee to be paid to the currency exchanger, as does converting it back to U.S. dollars. This is similar to stock trading, where small fees must be paid to the stock broker for their services. The advantages of FOREX trading include high potential for short term profits, but this comes at the expense of the disadvantage of volatility and fees.  Lastly, futures trading is a trading strategy that can be used by traders to create profits. Futures trading involves trading ownership of actual goods, such as gold, oil, corn, etc, at an agreed upon price. This means that buying futures contracts can be a financial risk if the trader does not wish to actually own the goods. Instead of having the goods delivered to their house, the trader usually opts to sell the ownership of the goods before the delivery occurs. That is one main disadvantage of trading commodities.            14 Chapter 3: Trading Systems 3.1. Trading System Overview Although this report is written for an automatic trading system in relatively medium length intervals, it is necessary to mention both shorter and longer length interval strategies, and the respective mindsets that align with these strategies. As previously mentioned, a trader’s psychological preferences will determine his mindset for trading and investing money. For example, an individual’s psychological preferences will determine the specific methods he/she will use to trade through a stock broker. These include, but are not limited to: stock brokerage preferences, time intervals of trades, personalized objectives, choosing manual or automatic trading, and utilizing fundamental or technical analysis. Lastly, an individual’s mindset will be a deciding factor in the rules he/she places in her trading/investing system. The entry rules, exit rules, position sizing, and order types are all decisions an individual must make when creating a trading strategy. 3.2 Trading platforms and brokerages The most common way trades are executed by investors in today’s day and age is through online trading platforms. For years, trades were ordered between buyers and sellers in trading floors through loud yelling and bargaining. This was before the widespread use of computers, and this method of trading was often hectic and noisy in comparison to today’s methods. In addition, trading floors were less efficient at creating many trades for large amounts of people. Because traders could only order trades physically, they were unable to order trades from anywhere other than the trading floor. In contrast to today’s methods of making trades online, trading in the pits was less organized. Trading online is popular among all kinds of traders for its organized, cleaner methods and structure. Online platforms such as TD Ameritrade, Tradestation, and MetaTrader are utilized by individuals looking to make money on the side in addition to their career, as well as being implemented in offices of professional trading companies. The advantages of these platforms outweigh the disadvantages due to today’s sophisticated technology in computing and trading.   15 Trading platforms allow traders and investors to order trades, either buying or selling, with a stock broker. The stock broker conducts the trade for the client, by trading on the stock market. Stock brokers offer their services at a fee, usually commission costs that allow them to make money. In addition, stock brokers can give advice to an individual on the best trades to make. Trades between the involved parties is done through exchanges. The two most popular brokerage account types are cash accounts and margin accounts.  The borrowing of money is often a topic that must come up between clients and professionals. Individuals, or clients for a company, can purchase assets on, “margin,” meaning they borrow money in order to make the purchase.  This is done instead of buying the asset upfront in cash. Buying assets on margin has loan interest rates that must be paid to the broker. These interest rate payments must be paid back to the broker regardless if the trade is successful or not. Buying on margin can also be done through using owned assets such as stock as collateral to buy new assets. Lastly, margin brokerage accounts allow individuals to short sell assets.  Cash brokerage accounts are beneficial for those with money saved up to purchase assets, and do not have to borrow money to purchase assets. In addition, purchasing assets in cash gets rid of interest rate payments that must be paid to the broker. However, an individual must have money initially in order to purchase assets with cash.  3.3 Growth and Value Investing The two most prevalent stock investing styles used in today's technological age are, "value investing investing" and "growth investing." Value investing is the strategy used by investors to gain profit through misvalued stocks. Investors such as Warren Buffet will capitalize on an underprice or overpriced stock, that they predict will reach its intrinsic value. This misalignment of intrinsic value to trading price is caused by volatility in the stock market, or miscalculated financial fundamentals. In general, this strategy is less useful in bull markets, like the current economy, since the stock is likely to be rising in price anyway, so purchasing it at a high price is less beneficial. Additionally, miscalculating the intrinsic value of a stock can decrease the profitability of this strategy.   16 Another popular investing strategy is growth investing. This strategy involves profiting from stocks that are expected to increase in price, by purchasing the stock when before a significant uptrend. An advantage of this strategy is its usefulness in bull markets, or when a companies performance improves its stock price. However, this strategy has a disadvantage during bear markets, and when the companies are performing poorly. The least risky, and the most profitable investing systems are those that incorporate both investing and growth investing strategies. Diversification in strategies, and stocks, is helpful for investors who wish to hold on to money for long periods of time. These systems, called hybrid systems, incorporate both strategies in a, "system of systems." 3.4 Trading Styles In addition to investing strategies, another way to profit from the stock market is through trading strategies. As opposed to investing strategies, trading strategies are shorter term, and include more frequent buying and selling of assets. Four trading styles are scalp trading, day trading, swing trading,  and long term trading. Scalp trading is buying and selling stocks extremely frequently. This is done through specialized hardware that is not available to the general public. Scalp trading, if done through a stock broker, would require high commision fees due to the high number of trades. However, these commission fees are not paid by Wall Street traders, and thus they can create large amounts of profit with an effective trading system. The reason Wall Street traders do not pay commissions is because they make agreements between companies and exchanges in order to create profits for both parties.  Day trading is trading assets within a single trading day. Scalp trading is one type of day trading. Generally, day trading strategies conduct trades within a single day, rather than keeping the stock until the next day. This strategy is advantageous for the same reasons as scalp trading, such as high potential for profits from a well-built strategy. However, commission fees are a disadvantage for non professional day traders.  Thirdly, swing trading is a trading strategy that is used by traders to create profit in a longer time frame than that of day trading. Swing trading is typically done through purchasing and selling assets in a  17 time frame of anywhere from two days to several weeks. This strategy takes advantage of uptrends in a stocks price. Therefore, less trades are needed than in a scalp or day trading strategy. Thus, less commision fees are necessary. However, swing trading has its disadvantages in the risk of the trade. Swing trading is more risky, due to the longer time frames, as holding onto a stock for long periods of time inherently is more risky. Lastly, long term trading is a trading strategy with longer time frames than swing trading. Long term trading requires less commission fees than the previously mentioned trading strategies, at the cost of higher risk. This strategy is very similar to investing, since both require trades of long time frames. These time frames can range anywhere from months to years before selling the trade. Long term trading, however, utilizes short selling in order to make profits, while investing does not.  Traders can use different methods of trading, as well. Two types of trading methods used today in the age of computers are manual trading and automatic algorithmic trading. Manual trading requires the trader to manually trade stocks through purchasing and selling the stocks through a stock broker. This can be done either on the phone or on the computer. Automatic algorithmic trading is used as a way to purchase and sell stocks automatically, through the use of computer algorithms that have been developed for the traders personalize objectives.  In this report for the Interactive Qualifying Project, the personalized objectives were chosen by the writer, David Cardoza. He chose to create two automatic algorithmic strategies to fit his personal objectives, and then created a, "system of systems" that optimized the two strategies through diversification and allocation of funds. His personalized objectives included creating the most amount of profit, with the least amount of drawdown. In addition, his strategy required little market research, and was primarily focused on technical analysis for the purpose of this project. Technical analysis contrasts with fundamental analysis, in that it focuses on the use of mathematical methods to create profits. Fundamental analysis uses qualitative data such as market performance, or company management to evaluate a stocks value. The use of technical analysis is useful when conducted with fundamental analysis  18 in order to create a diversified, robust strategy. Using just one does not allow a trader to see the big picture of a company and its stock price.  Technical analysis can be done through measurements or indicators of a stocks price movement. One major indicator used by swing traders is, "support and resistance lines," which help a trader recognize price movement patterns. A support is a price level at which a stock drops down to, but does not go below. A resistance is a price level at which a stock moves up to, but does not surpass. These lines can be utilized to predict the range of a stocks price level.  Using support and resistance lines, a trader can implement a strategy that involves "smoothies", a method in which trades are conducted as the price reaches the resistance and when the price drops to the support. When the price level reaches the support, the trader can assume the price will rise, and can purchase the stock in order to sell it. Likewise, when a stock price reaches the resistance line, the stock can be shorted and then bought when the price drops to a desired range. This is also known as a stop and reverse system.  The strategy requires the stocks be chosen manually, as there is no way to automatically select growth stocks on a computer. Through stock selection screeners, such as on finviz.com, criteria were determined through online research on growth stocks. For each letter of the acronym "CANSLIM", technical analysis was done to select stocks that qualify as growth stocks.  In this project, which uses historical data to analyze the profitability of trades and algorithms, it is assumed that stocks that have qualified as being growth stocks in the present will have also been qualified as a growth stock in 2010, which is how far back the historical data is used .While this may not be a strong assumption, it does however provide a systematic way of selecting stocks that can be used for scientific methods.       19 Chapter 4: Optimizing and Analyzing Trading Systems 4.1. Overview The use of optimization further ensures a system is profitable, as well as increasing the extent to which it is profitable. Doing so can help a trading system develop an "edge" over the market, and thus create profits. Having an edge over the market means a system has positive expectancy. Otherwise, a system that cannot beat the market is not likely to generate the optimal amount of funds, as a trader can find other methods that will generate larger revenue. This optimization is done through mathematical methods such as Walk Forward Optimization and Monte Carlo Analysis. These methods are used to determine if a system is likely to be profitable or not.  Another analytical technique used to optimize a trading system is Monte Carlo analysis, a statistical method that also predicts a system's future performance. The probability of a systems performance metrics, such as maximum drawdown can be predicted through Monte Carlo analysis. While Monte Carlo analysis can assist a trading system, ultimately the trader must use his intuition to determine if a trade is a logical idea.  4.2 Value of Managing a System of Systems A system of system can be improved through methods such as position sizing and diversification of stocks. Selecting the best stocks to trade allows a system to create the largest possible amount of profit per dollar, while minimizing risk. This is valuable because it lowers the risk of losing money, since each strategy is allocated funds based on its performance. Therefore, stocks with higher risk are allocated less money than those with lower risk.  Additionally, diversifying the stocks used can be helpful in activating or suspending the strategies used in the system of systems. When a strategy that can perform better in a certain situation, it is valuable to replace a strategy that does not perform as well.        20 4.3 Expectancy, Expectunity, andSystem Quality Expectancy, expectunity, and system quality are statistical metrics used in the evaluation of a trading strategy that help an automatic trading system by providing information on the profitability, risk, and variability of a strategy. For a trading strategy, the list of trades can analyzed to determine these three metrics.  Expectancy is the sum of the R multiple of all of the trades, divided by the total number of trades. To find the R multiple of a trade, the net profit of the trade is divided by the average loss of all the trades in the system. Expectancy is an evaluation of the profit or loss per dollar risk per trade.  Expectunity is closely related to expectancy, as it is the profit or loss per dollar risked per year. Another term for this is the annualized expectancy. This is found by mulitplying the expectancy by the trades per year. This is typically used as a metric to compare two systems, that may have differing amounts of trades per year. For the calculations done for this project, these results are normalized to find the system quality.  The third metric, system quality, is the net profit per dollar risked, relative to the total variability of the net profit per dollar risked. This metric is useful in determining the allocation of funds to the numerous strategies in a system of systems. Each strategy with a positive system quality will be allocated funds, with each one being allocated a fraction determined by its performance relative to the others. For allocation of funds, the fraction allocated to each strategy is the system quality of that strategy divide by the sum of the system qualities of all of the strategies that were allocated funds. System quality is calculated by multiplying the expectancy of a trading strategy by square root of the total number of trades, divided by the standard deviation of the R multiples of all of the trades.  4.4 Walk Forward Analysis Walk forward optimization evaluates a trading system strategy through its code, and determines the optimal parameters to use. it does this through a method known as out of sample testing. For instance, parameters such as the number of days forward or backward in a trend following strategy, or the length of a moving average are some examples of parameters that can be optimized through the use of walk  21 forward optimization. This is valuable for traders who wish to test their strategy without money, before using real money. Additionally, walk forward analysis determines the time intervals in which parameter optimization is useful. This is useful since the optimal parameter values may change over time, as the market adapts over time as well.  A method to ensure the profitability in the future is done through cluster analysis. Cluster analysis is done to create data on the walk forward efficiency of a strategy, which is an indication of how well the strategy will perform in the future in comparison to its past performance. A walk forward efficiency of 100% is an indication of the strategy performing just as well as the in-sample tests. A number higher or lower than 50% will indicate the strategy is likely to perform, respectively, better or worse than its has previously. (Walk Forward Summary) The optimal parameters for Walk Forward Analysis are useful for the specific strategy, and its designed purpose. For the strategy created in this project, the parameters indicated by the Walk Forward analysis are useful for bull markets, or whenever a stock's price level is increasing. It is not designed for shorting stocks, nor is it designed for decreasing price levels.               22 Chapter 5: Literature review In this project, analytical techniques were used to create the best possible system. Fundamental techniques such as CANSLIM stock selection were used to pick the stocks to be traded. Technical techniques such as trend-following "smoothies" trading and moving averages were utilized to optimally time trades. The two strategies utilized CANSLIM stock selection, with one strategy using trend following methods to take advantage of a rising price level, while the other strategy uses moving average crossover strategies to exploit price level movement.  5.1. CANSLIM Stock Selection CANSLIM stock selection is a stock selection method for choosing stocks with rising price levels. To take advantage of a rising stock price, this stock selection method uses seven criteria to determine if a stock should be chosen for a system, with each letter of the acronym CANSLIM representing criteria. While some of these methods cannot be easily quantified, it is up to the trader to use mathematical criteria to determine if a stock fits one of the criteria. For instance, in this system, market leaders were seen as those with high market caps, as there is no quantitative metric to determine if a stock is a market leader.  CANSLIM C- "Current quarterly earnings" must be high in comparison to the previous years. This indicates that a company is growing, and thus the price movement is uptrending as well.  A- "Annual earnings changes over five years" must be positive, which indicate the company is doing well and the price movement is improving.  N- "New product or new events" indicate a company will have positive price trends in the future as investors invest in the company due to the new product. For this project, the stock selection process gives preference to stocks which have a new product, or companies that consistently produce new products.  S- "Supply" and demand for the stock's shares must be high, which indicate investors and traders are interested in the company and thus cause positive price movement. Through technical analysis, this can be determined through the volume of a stock.  23 L- "Leaders" in the market perform better than "laggards" do, and thus the stock has more demand and the price will be uptrending. I- "Institutional Ownership" indicates a stock in which most of the shares are owned by large financial institution such as banks, hedge funds, equity firms, etc. A large percentage of institutional ownership is typically an indication a stock will perform well in the future.  M - "Market direction" indicates a company will be more likely to be uptrending if the market is in a bullish direction.  5.2. Trend Following "Smoothies" Strategy Trend-following strategies are strategies that follow the price level of an asset such as a stock share. These trend-following strategies typically keep the price level between the support and resistance trendlines. However, when the price level makes sharp changes, it will go outside of the space between the trendlines, indicating a change in a trend.  
  Figure 1: Visual explanation of  support and resistance lines (How to Trade) 
 24 A simple trend-following strategy will use moving averages to determine if the price is increasing, and if the trend will continue. By making a trade when the price level reaches the resistance or drops to the support, the trend-following strategy is optimized to make small improvements on the profits. This method is known as the "smoothies"method because it smooths out the trend by optimally timing trades.  5.3. Moving Average Crossover Strategy Moving averages are a widely used technical indicator used in order to estimate the direction a price level is moving. To calculate a moving average for a specified time interval, the price level at that time interval is averaged, resulting in a moving average calculation. For instance, the 5 day moving average is the sum  of the previous 4 price levels plus the current price, divided by 5 days. This is a simple moving average, in contrast to an exponential moving average. An exponential moving average gives larger weighting to the most recent prices, thus reflecting the price of the recent price changes more than a simple moving average does.  Shorter time frame moving averages are more reactive to changes in price levels, in comparison to longer time frames which react very slowly. These are respectively known as "fast" and "slow" moving averages. A common method of using moving averages is to compare a fast moving average to a slow one. If the fast is larger than the slow, it indicates the price level has increased rapidly. Also, if the slow is larger than the fast, then the price level has likely dropped sharply recently. Comparing a fast and slow moving average is just one method of analyzing the price level of a stock.          25 Chapter 6: Trend-following System 6.1. Overview. The first trading system created utilized CANSLIM stock selection process in order to choose growth stocks that will rise in price in the immediate future. To optimize the process of buying and selling the stocks, a Trend-following system bought and sold shares of stock through the guidelines of a resistance and support line trading strategy. These two analytical strategies complemented each other, and allowed for high profit margins with success in growth stocks specifically. Using both a stock selection process and an algorithmic trading strategy ensured the creation of a profitable system that will exploit price movements to earn money.  The advantage of this strategy is the high profit margins that come from growth stocks. Additionally, using a trend-following support and resistance method provides the trader with a way to maximize the profit by taking advantage of sharp increases in the stock price as it increases slowly over time. Thus, this strategy works best as a swing trading strategy, where stock shares are held over the time span of between several days and several weeks. Stock purchases and sells were optimized through the use of Walk Forward Optimization software, in order to find the optimal time span between the purchase and selling of a stock share. Trading stock shares too frequently will not create large profits, due to "overfitting" of a price level. Overfitting can lead to incorrect predictions and loss of money. However, too infrequent of trades will cause the strategy to take profits too late, and lose possible profits.  
 Figure 2: Code for the Trend-following strategy 
 26 In the above picture, the code shows the programming language Tradestation Development Environment which conducts trades based on user inputs. Here, the trendlines are programmed by the function TLValueEasy. The inputs of Start bar, Tgt (target) bar and endbar represent the starting point, the point to which to extend the trendline, and the final point of the trendline.  Stocks are purchased when the slow moving average exceeds the fast moving average, the open value for the day is larger than the fast moving average, and when the low reaches the trendline support. This ensure that trades are conducted at the lowest possible point. They are sold when the opposite occurs for each scenario, to allow the trades to be made at the highest possible point.  Consequently, the main disadvantage of using this strategy is the lack of adaptability that the strategy can provide to a trader. Using a one-size-fits-all algorithmic automatic strategy is not ideal for timing stock share purchases and sells. The erratic nature of stock prices makes it difficult to create a strategy capable of determining a timeframe or algorithm that will work every single time. Additionally, this algorithm will theoretically not work on stocks that are not growth stocks, and have not been selected through a CANSLIM selection process. Because such stocks will not have an uptrending price movement in the future, the algorithm will not be as useful as it would be for a stock selected through the CANSLIM selection. Also, during bear markets where price levels drop rapidly, this stock is likely to underperform and should be replaced by a different system.  6.2. Stock Selection The stock selection process for this strategy was the use of CANSLIM stocks, that passed numerous criteria in order to be chosen. Stocks were chosen from the stock screener on finviz.com, which has a wide variety of numerous technical and fundamental indicators to choose from, for analysis of each stock. For the stock selection, only stocks with market caps above $80 billion were chosen, as these are leaders of their industries, and are likely to be producing new products regularly as well. Next, institutional ownership, monthly performance, and annual performance percentages were found, and formatted onto an excel document. The criteria for each percentage was 10%, 5%, and 10% respectively. Any stock that fit at least 2 out of 3 of the percentage criteria were chosen. Finally, out of the 29 stocks that fit these criteria,  27 10 stocks from different sectors and industries were chosen in order to allow for a robust system. See the attached excel document for the chart. 6.3. Trend Following Automatic Algorithm  Because growth stocks have been selected through the CANSLIM method, they are likely to have uptrending price movements in the future. Thus, an algorithm that creates trades must keep in mind that the price will be increasing over time. In order to trade stocks that will be upwardly trending, a Trend following automatic algorithm trading strategy was created. Through the use of forward-projecting trendlines that determine support and resistance lines, this algorithm purchases stocks as it reaches its support line, and sells the stock when it reaches its resistance line. This ensures a more profitable system.
 Figure 3: BA Daily chart with the trend-following system trade times  The above chart shows when trades are conducted for Boeing, with day bars implemented. BA is the stock ticker used on the stock exchange for Boeing. This system was designed for rising price levels, and performed well for most of the stocks selected through CANSLIM selection. It is apparent from the picture that the strategy works best when the price level is increasing, and performs sub-optimally when 
 28 the price level is volatile.  
 Figure 4: Equity Curve for BA Daily, using the trend-following Strategy                
 29 Chapter 7: Moving Average Crossover System 7.1. Overview For the second trading strategy, CANSLIM stocks were chosen to create strategies that exploit rising price levels in order to generate a profit. This strategy utilized swing trading strategies that create profits in a swing trading time frame. In order to accomplish this, a strategy was created that utilizes price changes in swing trading time frames in a single trading day, with minimal trades such that the system is not overfitted. The goal of this strategy is to purchase the stock at a price when it has decreased in price relative to its previous price level, and selling it when the price has increased. By optimizing the moving average lengths, the strategy creates profits. This strategy is advantageous due to the lack of time commitment necessary for selecting stocks to use. However, similarly to the algorithm for the first strategy, a one-size-fits-all algorithm is difficult to create as every stock has different volatility. Thus, a disadvantage of this stock is that the strategy cannot predict unpredictable price movement in a day. Therefore, a strategy that works for one stock may not work for a different one. Additionally, a strategy that worked one day for one stock may not work the next day. However, this algorithm was optimized such that trades are reliably profitable.  7.2. Moving Average Crossover Algorithm For this strategy, a fast and a slow moving average were compared, and when the fast crossed over or under the slow, then a trade is initiated. The code is as follows: 
 Figure 5: Code for Moving Average Crossover Strategy  
 30 This system exploited the random price changes in a stocks price level without much concern about why the price level has changed. Overall, the system performed well. From Tradestation, the Lengths of the moving averages were optimized in terms of profit for each stock.   
 Figure 6: Boeing stock chart with daily bars, and optimized moving average lines.   In the above chart,  the optimized time for each moving average was 34 days and 22 days, found through optimization on TradeStation. This was advantageous to find the time frames that have historically worked the best with this stock.  The chart on the top shows BA stock prices, with the overlaid time when trades occured. The chart on the bottom shows the slow moving average in red, and the fast moving average in blue. These values were found to be 34 days and 22 days. However, the parameters set on the optimization code were between 1 and 35 days. Therefore, 34 days and 22 days were the optimal conditions for fast and slow moving averages of 35 days or less. Larger time frames will produce lower risk, but require longer 
 31 computation times for optimization on Tradestation. From the graphs, it is shown that this strategy worked well during both price level runs and during volatility. This is indicated by relatively small drops in the cumulative equity graph, and the consistently increasing price level.   
 Figure 7: Equity Curve of BA Daily using Moving Crossover strategy            
 32 Chapter 8: System of systems 8.1 Overview A system of systems was created on Portfolio Maestro on the TradeStation software. Using Portfolio Maestro allowed for fast calculations to be run on Monte Carlo analysis and for Walk Forward optimization. In addition, Portfolio Maestro created a total equity curve of the ten stocks in the portfolio, for both strategies. These ten stocks were: Boeing, United Healthcar Group, Microsoft, Verizon, Mastercard, Pepsico, Nike, Starbucks, and Paypal.  The second way that the system of systems was analyzed was through a unique analytical technique created for this project, in which the stocks that had positive system qualities were allocated money that was weighted based on its system quality performance relative to the other positive system qualities. The chart below demonstrates how each stock performed in each strategy. Those with negative system qualities were not included in this analysis.  	Strategy	1			Strategy	2	Stock	System	qlty.	Fraction	allocated	Stock	System	qlty.	Fraction	allocated	BA	0.96	0.05	BA	0.79	0.04	UNH	-0.86	0.00	UNH	-0.49	0.00	MSFT	1.98	0.11	MSFT	-0.37	0.00	V	0.77	0.04	V	-0.92	0.00	VZ	-0.92	0.00	VZ	0.75	0.04	MA	1.16	0.07	MA	2.21	0.13	PEP	0.96	0.05	PEP	1.67	0.09	NKE	0.87	0.05	NKE	3.62	0.20	SBUX	1.90	0.11	SBUX	-0.14	0.00	PYPL	-0.36	0.00	PYPL	1.67	0.00	 Figure 8: System quality and weighted allocation of funds chart Those that have positive system qualities were implemented onto Portfolio Maestro. These are the same stocks used for the first system of systems as well.  Overall, both system of systems performed well, and improved results. The advantage of using a system of systems was that it lowered risk by decreasing the value and frequency of price drops in the  33 total equity curve. While both system of systems were rudimentary and didn't take advantage of strategy activation or suspension rules, it did allow for a diversification of stocks that made the system less risky.  8.2 Portfolio Maestro System of Systems  
 Figure 9: Aggregate equity curve obtained from Portfolio Maestro, the first system of systems. Here, money allocation and optimization of individual strategies were not conducted. The initial value allotted to this sysem was $100,000. For this equity curve, all ten CANSLIM stocks were included regardless of its performance. Therefore, this had the two strategies both using the same ten stocks. Additionally, each strategy was given parameters that were constant. For the trendline support and resistance strategy, the parameters were kept constant. Similarly, for the moving average crossover strategy, the parameters were kept constant. This was not an ideal way to analyze the stocks, as the parameters in both strategies did not allow for strong performance for every single stock.  
 34  Figure 10: Aggregate Monte Carlo chart showing the probability of average return per trade. In this analysis, money allocation and optimization of individual strategies were not conducted. For the first system of systems, this analysis was conducted for both strategies, similarly to the total equity curve. Not only were the strategies not optimized for each stock, but also the Monte Carlo analysis included every stock in its evaluation regardless of its performance. The Monte Carlo analysis indicated that the system was unlikely to have a positive average return per trade, as indicated in the above figure. However, the historical value was slighlt positive, at an average of 0.015% return per trade. This number can be optimized through disregarding the underperforming stocks, which had negative system qualities. The average return per trade would likely improve if both strategies were optimized for each stock, rather than using the same parameters for each stock.   
 35  
 Figure 11 and 12: Total equity chart data summary In the above figure, the total statistical analysis of the system of systems is shown. The average winning trade of $129.33 is very favorable, as it shows that the system of systems successfully creates profitable trades. In addition, 73.99% of trades were profitable, indicating that the system was constantly creating winning trades. This shows that the stock selection process, in tandem with the system of systems, was profitable in the trading platform.  However, the largest losing trade was rather significant, as it was larger in dollar value than the largest winning trade. This shows me that the system requires more risk management. This can be done through stop orders, which automatically sell the shares when it drops below a certain dollar amount. This would 
 36 would in contrast to the current signal for selling a stock, which is written in the Easylanguage code on Tradestation. The system can also lower its risk by not trading the stocks with negative system qualities, and optimizing the strategy parameters for each individual stock.  
 
  Figure 13 and 14: Total Monte Carlo analysis statistics The above figure demonstrates the Monte Carlo statistics of the system of systems. I do not believe the system of systems was properly analyzed by the Monte Carlo analysis on Portfolio Maestro. Because the Monte Carlo analysis for the total percentage returned was so high compared to the predicted percentiles, 
 37 it shows that the selection of stocks I used was very effective when used in tandem with the algorithms. However, the statistics on average return and maximum drawdown were within the normal distribution.   These numbers were the historical values, and I believe these would be higher if the system ignored underperforming stocks, and optimized the strategy for each stock.  8.3 Microsoft Excel System of Systems In the second system of systems, all ten stocks were optimized for each strategy, and the list of trades were exported to a Microsoft excel spreadsheet. Here, the system qualities, expectancy, and expectunity were calculated. Then, the stocks that had a positive system quality in a strategy were chosen. Those with negative system qualities, as shown in Figure 8, were not selected and these are highlighted in red in the figure. Next, the selected stocks, that had positive system qualities in a strategy, were used to create a total equity curve. This was done in two ways, as shown in Figures 15 and 16.  The first curve demonstrates the aggregate equity curve of the second system of systems, with the weighted fraction allocation. The fraction allocated was calculated by dividing the stock’s system quality by the sum of all of the positive system qualities. This was done by listing all of the trades in an excel spreadsheet, multiplying the profit or loss for each trade by its stocks fraction allocation, then organizing all of the trades by date. This resulted in an aggregate equity curve over time.   The second chart, shown in Figure 16, was done very similarly. However, each stock was not given its fraction allocation. This was done to compared the equity curve to the one done on Portfolio Maestro, shown in Figure 9, since the Portfolio Maestro software did not account for optimzing each stock for each strategy, while my analysis on Excel did.    38  Figure 15: Aggregate equity chart of the system of systems, with weighted allocations.  For the optimized strategies with the use of weighted money allocation, the return was $7986 over the same timespan. From the system qualities of all the stocks, which indicates the overall return and risk of a system, the money was allocated to each stock. Stronger performing stocks, with higher system qualities, were given larger fractions. Ultimately, profits were less on this analysis, since the fraction allocations decreased the total trades conducted. As seen by comparing the Portfolio Maestro equity curve to the above graph, it is shown that this curve has less extreme drops in cumulative return, with larger rises in equity.  
 39  Figure 16: Aggregate equity chart of the system of systems, without weighted allocations.  Through my own analysis, and without weighted money allocation, the individually optimized strategies created a profit of $105,219. Similarly to the equity curve of, this equity curve was created on excel with optimized parameters for each individiual system. This can be compared to the Portfolio Maestro graph, which also did not weight the allocation of money, but did not optimize each individual strategy. This strategy had a higher net profit than the equity curve in the Portfolio Maestro, while also seeing less extreme drops in cumulative return.           
 40 Chapter 9: Summary and conclusions The overall system of systems was profitable, and I believe it can make money in its current state. For this system to make money, it would require money that can be used for trading. Such money can be used to trade on platforms such as Robinhood, where there are no commission costs. Additionally, commission costs can be diverted through trading with a stock broker that is willing to conduct trades for free.  The system of systems was useful in reducing risk, and optimizing the profits through position sizing and diversification. By diversifying the stocks used, the entire system was less volatile, as underperforming stock were accompanied by other stocks which performed well. Further risk management such as stop orders may help reduce the amount of negative return trades. In addition, more stocks can be researched, and backtests can be conducted on non-CANSLIM stocks in addition to stocks with diminisihing prices to determine if the strategy can work under those scenarios as well. Also, a wider range of parameters can be tested, to allow for large time frames in the moving average crossover strategy. The advantage of this will be lower risk, as larger time frames are usually less risky.               41 Works cited “Accumulation: Learn To Read Institutional Buying.” Investor's Business Daily, Investor's Business  Daily, 9 Feb. 2016, www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-accumulation-to- gauge-institutional-demand/.

to Effective
Day Trading
Mel Raiman, Ph.D.Foreword
I had the pleasure of speaking about day trading at WizeFEST 2002. After
the convention I prepared a small document addressing the subject of proxyWizemen and have since received numerous phone calls and e-mails.First of all, there is obviously considerable interest in day trading. Sec-ondly, based upon the questions that I am asked over and over, traderswant very specific answers to a multitude of questions. The purpose of thisexpanded publication is to answer many of these questions which I receivedaily. It’s really a short course in day trading with Wizetrade, and it is mysincere desire to bring everyone up to speed in the art of day trading. Yes,day trading is an art. There is a sixth sense, or a rhythm to day trading.Those who have it do better than those who do not, but  everyone whoapplies the principles outlined in the next few pages has to potential forconsistent success in this endeavor.
There is another reason for writing this publication. Since Wizefest, I
continually hear references to Mel’s Method. What I have been recom-mending is not a trading method, but alternative chart settings. You willdiscover, after looking through this material, that I use many trading meth-ods or systems. Day trading need not be a haphazard, frantic occupationand, maybe together, we can take some of the mystery out of short-termtrading.
I know that I have learned a lot compiling this information, which has
forced me to rethink the whole trading process and, gain new perspectivesin regard to the day-trading profession. I believe that everyone will gainnew insights into trading after reading this e-book. In fact, there is informa-tion contained herein that I guarantee will be new to every one of you.
I hope to follow-up this project with an update when the situation war-
rants. In the meantime, I wish each of you immense success at your cho-sen full- or part-time profession.
Note: This e-book was written in the Fall of 2002 immediately after speaking at thefirst Wizefest. I met hundreds of wonderful people at this event, and almost all ofthem were losing money trading Wizetrade. Since I have mentored traders for years,I put this publication together in the hope that this information might help to improvetheir trading.

Some Final Thoughts About Da y Trading .......................................................... 301: Let’s Take Care of Business
Day Trading is a Business
This first chapter is where we take care of some business before getting to the good stuff. I’m aware
that some readers are new to Wizetrade as well as new to day trading. So here we go: trading on-line isfun, it’s just like a computer game with one major difference, there is a lot of money at stake. So, unlessyou have money to burn, you had better approach day trading as business. I realize that many readerswant to get to important subjects such as which light should be used to exit a trade, but if you have neverrun your own business, you need to hear it.
Record Keeping and the IRS
Investing is not a business according to the IRS. If you are an investor, holding stocks for years at a
time (buy and hope), then you are required to pay capital gains. Trading, however, is a business and thepeople who work in the field are called traders. If trading is your full-time occupation, you should beregistered with the IRS as a “Market to Market Trader.” As a registered trader, your income is simplyordinary income and you have a wide range of allowable business deductions. Also, the filing process isactually far easier. I found the forms on the IRS web site, printed them out (search for market to market ),
and attached them to my tax return; it’s just that simple to register.
Secondly, you need records, unless you enjoy audits. At the market close, every day, I fill in my
trades on Microsoft Excel. When tax time rolls around, I print out all of the trades and attach them to myreturn. Why audit me? I’ve already supplied all of the information. If you supply the brokers statements,you may have a problem since they are not formatted as round trips, that is complete trades. I wrote twoformulas, one for longs and one for shorts, and simply fill in the boxes every day. It takes just a fewminutes, but my records are ready at tax time.

A Little Common Sense Can’t Hurt
I’ll leave cash management to other sections of the publication and other people’s books. You do,
however, need a modicum of common sense, perhaps a touch of fear. A few weeks ago I trained a newWizetrade user. She called me a few days later and thanked me for recommending a stock. It turns outshe made $2,200 trading 10,000 shares of a  $2 stock. There is not doubt that the potential for profit isgreater, the more shares you hold, but so is the risk. Personally, I hate to paper trade. If I’m trying a newtrading method, I’ll trade 100 shares, that makes it real money. If it goes against me a dime, I lost $10, not$100. On the other hand, I generally don’t exceed 1000 shares on any trade, perhaps I’m just a coward, butI’ve had too many trades go against me over the years. I can’t stand the pain, but I can stand a little whilea stock does a brief retracement (and Aussie Rob says stocks are boring). So, if you are new to trading, ornew to Wizetrade, make your first real trades with just a small amount of shares. This will keep you out oftrouble. I believe that all of the experienced Wizetraders have already discovered that Wizetrade is notthat easy; Wizetraders must make a lot of decisions and maintain a mental image of eight charts plus a lotof other information.2: Day Trading
Precision is the Key
Day Trading is More Than A Time Frame
I assume that you are either already a day trader or are considering day trading if you are reading this
e-book. Day trading is unlike other trading methods where the various time frames often define tradingstyles. For example, position traders often hold stocks for months, intermediate traders for weeks, andswing traders for days. Day traders, however, cannot be characterized as holding stocks for one day. Thereare instances calling for a trade that lasts just a few minutes, or perhaps a few hours. I have had profitabletrades last just seconds. I think you get the idea; day trading is a catchall term that encompasses manydifferent trading strategies which take place within a one-day trading period. There will be instances inwhich what began as a day trade develops into a swing trade, and other possibilities for overnight holds,but in general, this publication addresses day trading strategies.
As you read about the multitude of strategies and tactics that day traders use, (you can’t use them
all), it will be your decision to adopt those, or the one, that best fits your temperament. Many day-tradingstrategies are presented in detail which include chart settings, chart interpretation, execution of the trades,and most importantly, how a trader finds trades, or the best stocks to trade for a particular strategy. Newstrategies appear all the time, so please let me know if you have something you would like to have addedto the next version of this publication.
Traders who are most successful are specialists who use just one or two trading techniques and
become experts in their execution. Focusing on one or two strategies will bring repeated success. Everytime someone brings out a new strategy, we run to it, hoping for the magic bullet. Well, I have not foundany magic bullets, but I have identified a number of tactics that bring repeated success. Knowing how toexecute a particular strategy and being able to find the stocks that are ready to move when you want totrade is the most difficult situation facing most day traders. The bulk of the messages that clutter messageboards has to do with finding or identifying trades. At various times I have traded in a network of trading
buddies using instant messaging. I heard over and over: “have you got a trade,” or “I need a trade.” Thegood news is there are now some highly effective techniques for identifying stocks that are ready totrade—whenever you need a trade. I think you will enjoy and profit from these new developments in findingstocks that are about to, or have just begun to rally, long or short.
There are numerous advantages to day trading as well as disadvantages. Because day traders make
more trades than, say, position traders, there are more opportunities for error. Another disadvantage is thatday traders often miss the really big moves that some stocks make. Therefore, some day traders letsuccessful day trades develop into swing trades. Confirmed day traders, however, always close theirpositions before the market closes. An advantage to day trading is not holding stocks overnight. In thismarket, anything can happen which might cause stocks to gap against you at the open. I am wired as a daytrader and just hate worrying about a position when the market is closed.
Finally, if you wish to day trade, you should be willing and able to sit in front of a computer all day and
monitor a trade. If you cannot, then you can trade in the intermediate or long-term time frames.
You Must Have Goals and a Little More about Cash Management
All trades have goals. If you have a J.O.B., then your goal may be to simply make
a little extra now and then. Of course, if you have a J.O.B., then you probably shouldnot be day trading. If your goal is to earn a specific amount each day to build aretirement nest egg, pay some of your bills, or provide a regular income, you  caneasily compute what you must average each day to accomplish this goal. There are240 trading days in the calendar year. If you want to earn a gross income of, forexample, $50,000 per year, then divide this sum by 240 which is $208 per day. To thisyou must add your trading costs. If your round trip is about $15 and you make an averageof one trade per day, then you must average $223 per trade. Now, use this information in your cashmanagement. Let’s say that you find a great trade and are about to put on a trade. Suppose you buy 100
shares—not  very many shares—then this stock must move $2.23 in order for you to achieve your goal. Itis not very realistic to expect to profit this much on your average trade (in your dreams). Parenthetically,
many day traders subscribe to the 2.5% rule, that is, on average, you should not expect to get more than2.5% on a trade. That indicates that if you are trading a $30 stock, you really should not expect to get morethan 75¢ from the trade. Actually, you don’t know what you will get from the trade since there are so manyvariables. To be on the safe side, you probably should buy any where between 500 and 1,000 shares, if youhope to get your day’s pay from this trade. Either that, or plan on making more than one good trade duringthe day. Let’s complicate the matter, perhaps the ask for the stock is $75—“ oh no, I can’t afford it .” Well, if
you have a small trading pool, then you might plan to trade stocks that are lower priced. Actually, there aremany lower priced stocks that have a fairly good Average True Daily Range.
Average True Range —the difference between the daily high and low price of a stock
averaged over a number of days. The price of a stock does not govern it’s range,although higher-priced stocks tend to have greater ranges. Sometimes, stocks withhuge Average True Ranges are more volatile, which is something to consider. Ex-amples would be ABC which has a $2.45 Average True Range (and can be highlyvolatile) and ADM (Archer Daniels Midland) which is a $12 stock with a 20¢ AverageTrue Range). My on-line brokerage has a stock screener which allows me to searchfor the highest Average True Ranges within any price range. Further, I can select theBeta range, which will keep the volatility of the stocks within a pre-selected range ofvolatility. If you wish to find the Average True Range of a Stock, go to http://barchart.com, enter a stock symbol, and then click on Technicals  on the left side of
the page.
The bottom line is that you have to select stocks to trade that have the potential to generate a
reasonable profit while, at the same time, being in a price range that will allow you to purchase a reason-able number of shares (or sell short). Personally, I don’t thrive on extreme intra-day volatility (the trader
needs a seat belt), on the other hand, I hate watching paint dry, therefore, I tend to look for stocks that havea point or more Average True Range or find a stock that is rallying (more on that later).
If all of the above seems overwhelming, we will address the whole issue of finding the best stocks to
trade later in this e-book. Once you decide on how you will trade every day (your trading plan), and whatstrategies you will employ, all of the above becomes second nature through repetition. That is why it isimportant that you become a specialist. It is imperative that you have a trading plan before the open ofeach market. Just hoping to stumble across a good trade during the day, perhaps by listening to the dailyWizetrade broadcasts, is a sure fire way not to develop a steady income.
The Importance of Fundamentals to Day Traders (Don’t Send Me An Annual Report)
Every trading day I try to find the stocks that are driving the market. A few days ago I found one that
was screaming long on huge volume. When I found the stock, it was already up about two points, itfinished the day up $4.60 from the open. That’s a screamer—a WOW! (I’ll tell you later how I find thesestocks every single day.) I had never traded this stock before and the name was not familiar. I thought itwas a retail store from the name. Was I ever wrong, it turned out to be a global positioning satellitemanufacturer. No matter, it had what I needed and wanted in a day-trading stock: a huge increase in
relative volume (momentum) and was taking off. The Wizetrade charts were vertical and separated. I hadno plans to invest in the company, or attend the annual meeting. I wanted a trade. I did not now the PEG,the PE, cash flow, EBIT, dividend, etc. Furthermore, these fundamentals really did not matter to me at thetime. The only thing that mattered was that it was in the first stages of a huge rally. Parenthetically, it wasflat the next day, but that’s OK, I found a different screamer to trade. I believe you get the point, fundamen-tals absolutely do not matter to the day trader. Well, how about the following:
The Importance Technical Analysis
I hate to think of the hundreds of hours I devoted to learning technical analysis and the 3-4 hours I
spent every evening working on setups based on my knowledge of technicals. Now, Wizetrade is mytechnical analyst. It tells me what a stock is actually doing, in real time, in up to eight time frames. I still findit comforting to know where support and resistance are, but beyond that, I trust in the Wizetrade charts. An
equity may have a golden cross, or make a double bottom, but all that really matters is what it is doing now.I used to subscribe to a day traders’ setup service. Every day these professional traders would present alist of stocks to trade along with the triggers (pivot points) for going long and short. I noticed that the dailysetup list always stated that if you have the “red light—green light system, just follow the lights.” I finallyfound out that they were referring to Wizetrade.
Long Versus Short
It is helpful and profitable to be able to go both long and short. If you are new to trading you need to
read this, if you are experienced, skip ahead. Going long simple means buying a stock and selling it whenit is at a higher price (buy low, sell high). Shorting allows the trader to make a profit on a stock that isdropping in price. There are traders who only go long and others who only go short. One advantage ofshorting is that when stocks drop, it is often a very quick and significant move.
Let me briefly explain how a short works. First of all, you must have a margin account with your
brokerage. A margin account allows you to borrow stock from the broker (you can also trade on credit).When you short a stock you are actually borrowing the stock from the broker, hence the margin account,
even if you have the cash in the account to cover the trade. The trade begins by borrowing the stock andselling it; the term used is selling short . Since you initiated  trade by selling short a borrowed stock, the
cash from the sale is placed in your margin account. You are going to have to buy back this stock andreturn it to the broker;  your trading goal is to buy it back at a lower price than you sold it. You get to keepthe difference. When you buy back the stock, you  buy to cover . That’s about it. Reading the Wizetrade
charts is the same, just upside down. There are a few other things you need to know. Sometimes your tradewill be refused because your brokerage does not have shares available to sell short. One other importantpoint, after placing your order, you must have an up tick, that is, the price of the stock must move up (apenny will do) before they will fill your order.
The big boys don’t have this rule; it was instituted to keep the small trader out of thislucrative portion of the market. Why not have a down tick rule that forces the trader towait for a down tick before entering a long? I love symmetry.
Market Versus Limit Orders and Other Information About Getting In and Out of Trades
Although we will address dealing with market makers and specialists later, at this point, keep in mind
that orders for selling short should not be at the market , but placed as a  limit order . When sending a market
order to sell short, you are giving a license to the market makers to fill you at any price (what ever themarket price is when they get around to filling your order). This is particularly risky for a short because youwon’t get filled until there is an uptick. Suppose the stock falls a point without an uptick while you arewaiting to get filled—remember, you can NOT cancel a market order—and you finally get filled at thebottom. If you had placed a limit order, the price would simply have dropped past your limit without filling.At that point, you should cancel or modify the limit (you don’t want to get filled when the stock is on the wayback up two hours later) and file a new limit at a lower price. I always set my limit just below the bid. That’sright, you sell short at the bid price, not the ask. Maybe the next paragraph will clarify buying, selling,selling short, and buying to cover.
At what price do you buy and sell for longs and shorts? Aussie Rob once mentioned an easy method
for remembering: “you always get the worst price.”  When you want to go long, what to you pay, the bid orthe ask. Which is the worst price—the ask—that’s what you pay. When shorting, you want to get thehighest price. You guessed it, you sell short at the bid, or the lowest price. When you are ready to buy tocover, you want the lowest price; right again, you get the highest price, that is, the ask. You always get theworst price. Easy isn’t it?
There are many instances when I place orders at the market (a market order). For example, when I
am trading a highly liquid (high volume stock) with a small spread, I usually go in and out at the market onlongs. I also use market orders to exit short positions (buy to cover). It’s just entering shorts that is particu-larly difficult. That is also the reason that Wizetrade recommends trading only highly liquid stocks forshorts. If there is a lot of action, you won’t have to w ait forever to get filled. The general rule is a minimum
of 300,000 shares of average daily volume for longs and 600,000 minimum average daily volume forshorts. I generally look for stocks that trade a million or more shares a day.
Here is another rule of thumb: for every thousand shares you plan on trading, the stock should trade
a million shares a day on average. Remember, it is easy to get into a trade, but you want to be able to getout when ready to sell. Also, low volume stocks tend to have higher spreads (the difference between thebid and the ask).
Stocks Have Individual Trading Characteristics
Stocks have personalities. One advantage to trading the same stocks all the time is you learn how
they trade. I have often traded MSFT (Microsoft) and know that the spread is always 1¢ or 2¢. Recently Imade several  trades on BBY (Best Buy). On BBY there might be a very tight spread, but, when thespecialist  senses a rally, he or she raises the ask price a dime or so (in the NYSE trades are executed bya specialist; the NASDAQ uses a system of market makers). This is aggravating (polite language) if youare just about to enter, but great if you are already in the trade. If you are trading a stock for the first time,you often don’t know how it will move. Some stocks are incredibly volatile, others trade as smoothly as silk.These personalities actually reflect how many traders are on the stock, the personality of the market maker
and other factors. The more day traders, the more volume, the more volatility. I can assure you that youwon’t have this volatility trading food stocks, but then the potential for big moves won’t be there either.
I guess you have gathered that I like highly liquid stocks with an acceptable Average True Range and
a small spread. When the spread is penny or two, I just go in at the market . When the spread approaches
8¢ or 9¢ I am unwilling to pay the ask price. If I really want in, I split the spread, that is, I send a limit orderbetween the bid and ask and hope to get filled. Often, the stock starts to move and I don’t get filled. At thatpoint, if I really want in, I just cancel the limit and send a market order. If it starts moving too fast, I just passon the trade. Another rule: never chase a trade.
Here is a situation you may have faced, or will face. Orders are being filled above the ask; you cannot
trust the market maker to fill you at the ask. What you should do here is place a limit order a penny abovethe ask. The rules state that you become first in line to get filled, at the best price, which is the ask. Thisoften works but not always. I desperately wanted to get into S (Sears) and placed a limit above the ask. Iwas ignored; I waited about two or three minutes—no stock—then the stock rallied and I just passed on thetrade. I no longer trade S, it’s on my blacklist because of the personality of the specialist. He had his plansfor a rally and just ignored me.
Throughout the rest of this e-book, we will address trading issues, but now it’s time to move on to the
nuts and bolts; the good stuff; you know, what light do I use to exit.3: Setting the Lights
No, You Don’t Trade the Colors, You Trade the Charts
I had a gentlemen tell me recently that he went long when all the lights were green. Wouldn’t it be
great if it were that simple? It is not and he has lost a lot of money. I used Wizetrade for quite a while beforeI realized that I really did not understand it. Keeping track of eight charts, timing entrances and exits,finding trades that are setup properly, and monitoring the market is tough. Furthermore, the longer thetrade, for example a position trade can be very long, the more room there is for slippage, the shorter thetrade, the less room for slippage. If you are a scalper trying for pennies, then your level of precision mustbe close to perfect. If you don’t want to handle these situations, then do not adopt those strategies callingfor super-high-levels of precision. I’ll illustrate several situations and how they might best be handled. Inthe process, we will establish some rules. In the end, however, your success will come down to your skill
level at identifying trades, interpreting the lights and their relationships, and timing.
“Successful trading is really very simple. Buy a stock at the right time and sell it atthe right time.”
When I first installed Wizetrade, I used a traditional light or chart setup which can be used for posi-
tion, intermediate, or swing trades. This setup, which is illustrated below, employs the Three Wizemen  as
direction indicators, calls for a cross on the day chart that is no more than two-days old for day trading, anda relatively new 150-minute chart.
The Problem of Using a Swing-Trade Setup for Day Trades
Let me make it clear that if you intend to swing trade, you must use the above setup and follow the
rules calling for a strong month, week, and a fresh cross on the day. My experience using the above setupfor day trading has been relatively unsuccessful. I was trying to line up too many charts, that is, get toomany ducks in a row. I forever had stocks on my radar  but seemed to always miss the fresh crosses.
Furthermore, I kept noticing that the stocks that were rallying for the day often had unacceptable Wizemen(see chart above). Every now and then everything was in place and I had a nice trade, but not oftenenough. Throughout these early experiences with Wizetrade, I noticed that I could trust the long minutecharts in regard to the short-term direction of a stock. A fresh cross on the 150 to the upside almost alwaysmeant the stock would rally long, despite what the three Wizemen, which are long-term trend indicators,said. I can’t tell you the number of longs and shorts that I have missed because I was following the rules
and did not take trades because of the Three Wizemen. The new chart setups that I developed changedthe whole situation. As an example, I recently traded MO (Phillip Morris) long for $1.16 on a strong 150against a red day light.
I trade for a living, I trade every day, and I trade in every type of market. I cannot afford to sit around
waiting for a trade. I can’t afford to pass up good trades just because of some long-term indicator. You getthe idea. The Three Wizemen are much longer-term indicators and take time to catch up with the short-term trends of a cycling or channeling stock, which are the day-traders’ bread and butter. The principle oftrading with these Three Wizemen is absolutely sound and will protect the investor (not the trader), but thesystem is impractical for the day trader. The day trader must be nimble and able to change direction at alltimes, but at the same time, execute safe, low-risk trades.Typical Swing Trade Setup

We are now going to look at a new paradigm that shifts the powers of the three Wizemen closer to the
short-term lights, that is, the short term direction of a stock. In order not to confuse the issue, we will referto these substitute or proxy Wizemen and the three direction indicators . In fact, my day-trading setup no
longer allows me to see the Three Wizemen. Because the longest lights are now minute lights, theyassume added importance for the day, or even shorter term. In fact, they help me focus on what I am reallymost interested in, trades that will take place in very short period of time, always less than a day. There isalways some give and take; the day trader using this setup gives up any thought of remaining in the tradefor a long period of time, but gains in increased reliability in the short term. If the trade is going well nearthe close, the trader can switch to a swing-trade setup and decide on whether on not to let the tradecontinue as a swing trade, but that is not the subject of this e-book.
With this new light setup, it is far easier to identify trading setups, continually trade the same stocks
long and short, and short a stock that has just completed a long rally. I truly believe that using this setup issafer and helps the day trader focus on those issues most important to entering a short-term trade.
There are several Wizetraders who have been experimenting with day-trading light setups. I have
traded at least six different setups including one exotic set of charts based on Fibonacci numbers and aseries of ratios. In the end, I have settled on a rather traditional set of charts that work just fine. For thepurpose of presenting examples with consistency of continuity, the following generic day trading setup  will
be used. Of course, you are free to experiment with any setup you feel is appropriate (also see light setupson page 31). If you select to trade very volatile, high speed, short term scalps, you might wish to havemore short-term minute lights. I found that I was being shaken out of perfectly good trades by the shortterm lights, so I have gradually placed more importance on the longer-term minute charts.
The illustration above is of a generic day-trading setup. I have named the various parts of the setup
so that we can refer to them in the following examples. Please understand that there are other setups; onethat comes to mind is the strategy used by John Tuma that uses the 1, 2, 3, and 5 minute-lights for theshort minute charts. I often use an 8-minute light instead of the 10, but for training purposes, please bear
with me as we work with this generic setup.
Defining the Day-Trading Setup
I know what you are going to ask. Why do we need so many timing lights, or trigger lights or direction
indicators? I used to be a college professor and I’m way ahead of you. The answer is that for any particularstrategy you might use just one trigger or one trading light, but because we are going to present manystrategies, we will have different triggers, timing lights, etc. That is the reason that I recommend becomingproficient in just a few strategies, because the rules and procedures change as you switch from strategy tostrategy.Generic Day Trade Setup

Trading
Lights     The following define the components of a
generic day-trading setup:
Direction Indicators : these three indica-
tors replace the traditional three Wizemen. Re-member, you do NOT trade the colors, you tradethe charts. The colors are a heads up that some-thing may be happening in the chats. In thisexample, all three Direction Indicators aregreen; you guessed it, we may have a long. Ifyou wish to have the least amount of risk in atrade, don’t trade against the Direction Indica-tors. Heck, we’ve already eliminated the tradi-tional Three Wizemen, you don’t want to fudgeon the substitutes.
Timing Lights : these charts are used to
fine tune entrances, give a heads up on the con- tinued direc-
tion, or change of direction of a trade, or to fine tune the exit from a trade. They also forewarn of a possibleentrance as they move from left to right: the wave. I sometimes switch the 2-minute chart to 1-minute to
catch the last little bit of a trade, or finely tune an entrance.
Trading Lights : usually one of the middle indicators such as the 30-minute or 60-minute chart. The
trading lights or charts play a key role in the decision to enter or remain in a trade.
Trigger Lights : A trigger light, usually a fresh cross in the direction of the trade, is used to time the
entrance. Mark McDonnell says: “I like to have something to hang my hat on.” This is the hat rack. I alwayslike to enter a trade on a brand new something. Why so many triggers, because different types of tradescall for longer or shorter lights. Have you ever wanted into a trade as you watched a stock climbingsteadily, only to enter and have the 10-minute light go red? It’s happened to me more than once. That’swhat happens when you don’t get a fresh cross on the trigger. So much for nomenclature, let’s address howthey are used in real trades. (Also, see page 31 for additional information on using the lights and setups.)
4: Using the Charts to Manage A Trade
Green is Up  and Red is Down
I once had a phone call from a friend I had trained who was trading GILD. He told me what he was in
for and I was proud of him; I thought he was in a profit in a short. Wrong. He was long and losing big time.Silly me, when I spotted the red Direction Indicators I just assumed he was short. When questioned aboutwhy he was long, I was told that: “there are just too many things to remember.”  Fair enough. I just boiledit down for him:  green is up  and red is down.
There are specialty trades in which you trade against the Direction Indicators.
For the time being at least, we are going to address standard vanilla trades (Bb tradesfor you musicians), your everyday garden variety going long and short with the lights.I can usually evaluate a potential trade in just a few seconds. Beginning on the right,I click through the charts evaluating, making mental images, looking at the volumeand indices, and ultimately making a decision on whether or not this is worth taking, orwhat signals I will have to wait for before pulling the trigger.
The longest Direction Indicator simply needs to be in the direction of the trade. If
you plan on a long, then it has to be green; even an embryonic cross will do. It goeswithout saying that a strong cross, or even divergence only strengthens your position.The 90-minute chart (see example) helps to make a decision since it may be easier tointerpret than the 150 or 180 (many traders are also using the 130). After looking at the150, the next key Direction Indicator is the 60—it has to be strong—period. If is em-bryonic, lying on its side, or just taking the day off, I usually pass on the trade, unlessI see unusual strength developing in the 30. I refer to the 60 and the 30 as the tradinglights. They are very close to where I am going to be working (trading) and will be a deciding factor inwhether I pursue the trade any further. In regard to the 60, it has to be strong, but not too overextended; ifit has been running for three days I will usually pass. A few black boxes are OK, however. Oh how I love tofind a fresh, strong cross (no gator mouth) on the 30. If I find a fresh 30, and everything to the right isNote: Sometimes I use a 20-minute light insteadof the 15. Some stocks trade better or are easierto read in different time frames.Generic Day Trade Setup

acceptable, I know I have a trade. The 30 and the 10 will let you know in a hurry
how the stock is doing, right now. If the 30 has been running a few boxes, then Icheck the 10-minute chart. Here is where it gets tricky.
Note: If you are new to trading and/or Wizetrade, you may think it takes along time for the lights to change. If the time is right, the lights can switch ina heartbeat. I was watching a stock (MXIM), which was all red when itrallied. In a matter of three or four minutes the 150 went from a short to along as did the 2 minute light and everything in between. Wizetrade sensedthe increased buying pressure and volume increase and flipped all the lights.
The stock rallied for $1.74 in a very short time.
If the 10 is fresh, I might get right in, especially is the 30 is strong and
getting stronger and we have increasing volume. If the ten is out a box or two ormore, but still strong or getting stronger (diverging lines) I might look at shorterlights, even the 2-minute chart, for a quick recycle and new entrance. Remem-ber, I prefer getting into a trade on a fresh something. I will even go down and getan entrance from a 1-minute chart. If the ten has been running for a while, thenI will probably wait for a retracement and a new entrance. The trader has tomake a lot of decisions—quickly.
Managing and Exiting A Trade
If I timed my entrance properly, I usually move quickly into profit. Using
the 8-minute chart instead of the 10-minute will often get you into place beforethe stock really starts to move. This has happened to me numerous times andeach time I think that I made a mistake, nothing is happening, and then thestock takes off—amazing—and very helpful in getting into a trade before themarket maker senses a rally and starts to raise the ask. Once in a trade, sometraders simply trade the 8- or 10-minute chart. Try to keep track of the lightsaround the trade as well as well as the volume. Many traders keep the QQQsand SPYs up on Wizetrade to see if the market is pulling back or rallying. Watchout for greed. Once you are in a profitable position you should not take a loss ona trade. Earlier I discussed a trade on big MO (Philip Morris). I started to getconcerned when the 5-minute light went red, then the 10, and finally the 30. MObegan pulling back but I remained in this trade. Why? Because the 30-minutechart went flat but did not pull back, because this occurred in the middle of theday when most stocks retrace a little, and most importantly, because the 60-minute chart was diverging, that is, getting stronger. The strengthening 60-minutechart was the deciding factor. There would have been nothing wrong with get-ting out and taking a $720 profit, but by following the charts, I closed my positionfor $1160 (this is called leaning on a stock ).
I’d like to give a rule for exiting, but there are too many valid reasons. First of all, it depends on what
kind of trade you are on. A few weeks ago I was on a short-term scalp (maybe a five-minute trade) andexited when the 1-minute chart started to converge. All the lights were green. The second I got out,everything went red. I knew the stock and how it traded. I knew that it could give up 50¢ to 70¢ in seconds,so I was ready for it. This style of extreme scalping requires you to have a seatbelt on your chair and a barfbag. Another reason for closing a trade is reaching a goal; you may remember that I mentioned the 2.5%limit used by many traders. Sometimes I leave just because I am satisfied with the profit and the volumeis dropping and the charts are flattening out, its the reversal period (lunch), the market is starting to tank,the 30 is converging and the 2 is pulling back—any number of reasons. Once I took $300 from SLABbecause my wife needed help with something. I returned to the computer only to find out SLAB had madea six point move (the story of my life). If you are trading a particular curve such as the 30 and the 10changes to red, begin looking at the short timing lights for a possible exit. Don’t give up a lot of profit; youcan always reenter a trade later if the stock begins a new run.Here is a 30-minutechart that you shouldNOT enter on. It isoverextended andconverging with fallingvolume.
This an example of astrong entrance on the10 with good indicesand increasing volume.
Setting Stops
Before entering a trade, you should already know at what point you will exit if the trade goes against
you. Are you willing to draw down $100 before exiting? If that’s the case and you draw down that much,then you should take the loss. That’s a mental stop. I only use mental stops because market makers havea nasty habit of stealing stock (if you can hide your stops on Level II, go ahead and use them). Those pricespikes that occasionally stick up or down on bar charts are not problems with your signal feed. Here is anexample. You bought XYZ at $15 and it’s now $16. You wish to protect yourself so you set a stop at $15 sothat you will at least protect your trading capital. You plan to raise the stop as the price goes up; suddenlythe price drops a point or two for a new seconds and your stock has been sold at $15. What a deal, themarket maker bought your $16 stock for $15—I try not to give market makers that opportunity. On theother hand, if I must leave the screen, I will set a very tight stop and remove it when I return.
Forcing A Trade
As we finish this section on trading, there are several little items worth mentioning to those of you
who are new to day trading. First of all, don’t force a trade. Forcing a trade occurs when something is notright, but you really want to trade. You take the trade any way hoping that it will work out—it rarely does.Trading against the indices (S&P, DOW, NASDAQ), entering a trade when the lights going back and forthbetween red and greed (buyers and sellers are almost equal), taking weak signals, entering when yourtrading chart (light) is overextended—these are some of the reasons leading to poor trades. There aretimes the market is so bad I just pass. For example, the afternoon before the start of the Labor Dayweekend. The volume just dried up. It just wasn’t worth the risk.
5: The Most Important Factor in Finding A Trade
PC + RVI = M — The Formula for Guaranteed Success
This formula is my way of stating that there are only two important criteria for finding a long or short
that really make any difference. The first has to do with price change; if it is a long, the price must beramping up. That’s often what the gainers and losers in Wizetrade show you: which stocks have gone upthe most. If many stocks are going up, it’s difficult to select the best trade, even by looking at the volume.Volume is a relative measure. If Microsoft has gone up 30¢ by 9:40 (AM) on 100,000 shares, that’s not assignificant as some small cap stock, that usually trades 200,000 shares per day on average, trading 70,000shares in the open. In reality, it is the small cap stock that will probably make the biggest move on thistrading day, maybe become a one-day wonder. It’s not which stock trades the most volume, but whichstock has the greatest relative volume that matters. However, there is no way for you to make this judge-ment in the first few minutes of the market since you cannot compute each stock’s relative volume. As youread on through this e-book, I will actually tell you how to do this, and, by having this information, be ableto select the very top stock, or stocks, for the day. You see , price change combined with an huge
increase in the relative volume equals momentum . When you find a stock that has both, you will find
charts that have separation and angle, sometimes with the green line standing straight up. These are thestocks we talk about after the market. These are the ones that move 2, 3, or more points in the morningand climb four points or more during the day. There are many systems in use by traders to find thesestocks in a hurry every day. Recently, the message boards have had a lot of chatter about rockets. This
system actually works to the extent that you will probably find decent trades. Actually, all of the day-tradingsystems that are going to be covered by this publication work. However, finding the really BIG TRADES,the screamers, is elusive, and only occasionally did I stumble over them, until recently. As you read on, I’lllet you in on a system that will bring you PC + RVI = M stocks all day long. Stocks that are just beginninga rally, at the open, or at any time throughout the day. It’s easy to run gainers and losers or Wizefinder atthe open and find trades, but many of these stocks quickly run out of steam. Finding a stock that is juststarting a new rally at 10:27, or 12:15, or 2:05 is really tough, unless you park yourself on a stock. The goodnews is this problem may have been solved, so read on. We address methods of finding trades in the nextsection.6: Tools of the Trade: Finding A Trade
Do I Need A Broker?
I once trained a new trader and was on the phone for
hours, covering much of what you have already read. Whenwe finished he asked: “Will I need a broker?” Yes—and thereare a lot of other handy tools available to the Wizetrader, someof which, if you have been paying attention, have been hintedat several times. Following are some of the resources avail-able to you that will be mentioned when we define trading strat-egies (presented in no particular order):
Intraday Scanner from CBS Marketwatch
This is an excellent financial web site for kinds of trading
information (
cbs.marketwatch.com). Keakadog (real name
Jack) has a strategy for the open that calls for having stocksthat have had a 10% move the previous day. He has a rela-tively involved method for selecting these stocks. I find thatthis scanner can get me what I need in a hurry. You can selectlongs or shorts, your volume requirements, percent of increaseor decrease, and lots of information (see screener on right).Once the data appears, you can sort by clicking at the top ofany of the columns. If, for example, you want to see the larg-est price move rather than percent, then click on the prices. There is no charge for any of these web sites.
Finding the Volatile Stocks and More at Lycos Finance:
http://finance .lycos.com/home/research/mostactiv e.asp
This is another site that will provide data to the day trader such as: largest range, most volatile,
unusual volume, and unfilled gaps.
Other Useful Web Sites
I have book-marked dozens of sites for one reason of another. I mention a few of them here, but don’t
want to confuse new traders. The fastest way I know of to find support and resistance is to go to www.
stockconsultant.com. Just type in your stock and find all the support and resistance points and lots more
about any stock. You can also get support and resistance at www.barchart.com. Price, support, pivot and
resistance are given after you select a stock and click opinion. The days of drawing lines are over folks.
The VIX is a volatility index for the markets. When the VIX goes over 40, start watching for a rally.
You can find the VIX at www.cboe.com.
Map of the Market (www.smartmoney.com)
Each box represents a major player in the overall mar-
ket. On the day that this snapshot of the Map of the Market
was taken, I seriously considered shorting (black representsstocks that are going sideways and red, stocks that are tank-ing. By placing your cursor on a box, you will be given infor-mation about the particular equity such as the name, stocksymbol, amount and percent of gain or loss. A further clickwill bring you to more information about the company in-cluding a quote, average daily volume, and a chart.
The stocks are grouped by sector and industry groups
so it is possible to drill down to, for example, to tech, thenchips, and then—you get it. So if retail is hot, you can drilldown to the stock that has made the biggest move for theday. This information is not in real time, that is, it appearswith a twenty-minute delay, so it is no very timely for day traders.
Pre-Market Action
Every morning I watch the stock shows, switching back and forth
looking for interviews from the trading floors. I try to get a feel about howthe markets will open, what the latest financial reports say, (usually about8:30 EST), upgrades and downgrades, the pre-market indices, and maybea heads up on some report that is expected later in the day. I guess ishelps a little, but not much.
NASDAQ has a Pre-Market Heatmap, shown on the right, which vi-
sually represents what the NASDAQ 100 are doing in the pre-market. TheHeatmap Strategy, which is addressed in the next section, utilizes thismap which can be found at 
www.nasdaq.com and then following the links.
7: Tools of the Trade Part II:
Finding A Trade In Real Time
Do I Need A Plan?
I used to trade the same stocks everyday. My plan
has changed and I start the trading day with a blankWizetrade. Every day traders approache finding tradesdifferently. If you don’t believe me, look at some of theposts on the message boards. Let me mention a fewapproaches to finding a trade. Some traders trade just afew stocks all the time, other have a group of fifteenstocks loaded in Wizetrade and look for fresh crosseson the 150 or 180 (some use the 130). They then movethe best longs or shorts to the front page depending uponwhether we are having a positive or negative day. Oth-ers are waiting for e-mails from Delta Alerts, while sometraders are on the message boards. There are two pri-mary message boards: if you have Wizefinder you will find a club link by logging in after 9:30 EST andreading the posts for the day (good music to trade by at times). Others are on the Yahoo site which you canfind by following links from 
Wizetrade.com. You can do all of the above while listening to the daily broad-
casts and training from Wizetrade through Wizefinder.
In the past I traded with a group of buddies and we communicated by using Yahoo’s instant messag-
ing. After a while, this drove me to distraction. Now Itrade in quiet, in an organized, methodical manner. It’s abusiness after all, not a carnival.
What do some of our serious brethren do? You
know, the ones who are posting their finds (you can findyour own—why wait for postings)? Some people waitabout ten minutes after the start and run Wizefinder. Re-member, this section is to let you know some of the typi-cal tools that Wizetrader’s use, not to describe the strat-egies.
In your Wizetrade database, you have up to 500
stock symbols. I’ve had as many as 900 and it workedfine, (if you work in Tech Support, please note that Icleaned it out and now have only about 300). Thesestocks should be your favorites, not the ones that camepre-loaded from the Wizetrade. They should be in yourprice range and meet your volume and other parameters. After specifying your scan requirements in theparameters section, many traders run the Gainers and Losers to see what’s running. Several strategies arebuilt around this tool and are addressed in Trading Strategies after this section.
HotScans
I want to share an experience with my fellow Wizetraders that has completely changed my day-
trading. I planned on releasing this e-book back in early December, but I wanted to test HotScans beforecommenting on its reliability and validity. For those of you who forgot your statistics, reliability refers to asoftware program generating consistent results. Validity has to do with searching for the right informationor data, in this case. Validity would be poor, for example, if it found shorts when I was looking for longs.There are many scanning programs on the market and I wanted to be absolutely certain that this was thebest—in a new league.
In early October I was invited to be a beta tester for HotScans which is not a new firm, just a new
product. It is produced by MarketGauge
® which is already an industry standard for the “professionals.”
After agreeing to participate, I took part in numerous conference calls with their programers who asked meexactly what is is that I want to find. That is easy. All Wizetraders who are day traders could have told themin a heart beat what they hoped to find every trading day, but rarely found. What the heck—I told them. Thepeople with whom I was dealing at MarketGauge
® turned out to be former pit traders, market makers,
hedge fund managers, and professional traders (as in trading companies). These are the big boys whom
we always like to kid about as in the market maker drove the price down so his friends could get in cheaper,
or, did you see the price he got in at; who does he know?  I did a little research and following are excerpts
from a review of MarketGauge® published in the prestigious Stocks and Commodities  magazine:
MarketGauge pro vides traders with capabilities and access to data that until re-
cently were the exclusive domain of prof essional tr aders. It’s true that there is an
increasing number of excellent stock screening and market analysis web sitesand software packages on the market; it is equally true that MarketGauge takes aback seat to none.
- David Penn, Staff Writer for Stocks and Commodities
It was the intent of MarketGauge
® to produce a similar product geared exclusively for the use of
professional day traders. This was a pipe dream to me. I had described the perfect real-time trade finder tothe programers and other professionals, and then, sort of forgot about the software. Then one day I re-ceived an e-mail with the link that would take me into the special web site that had an operating version ofHotScans. It was a down day (DOW down -177 and the NASDAQ down -47). I started looking for longs, INTHE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING! The first thing I did wasenter my parameters at the top of a blank page; you knowthe drill, price range, volume requirements, exchanges, etc.Then I pushed run and voila, 25 trades appeared, ranked
from strongest to weakest trade. I pushed again—this timethere were a few changes. I had selected Rallying Now from
among the many trading choices. I stopped trading and testedHotScans for the rest of the day. I checked out more thanthree-dozen recommendations. Every single one of them hada great rally. The worst was good for about 50¢, the best rana point or two. They all had strong crosses, separation, andgreat volume. Can you image, great longs on an extremelydown day? Of course, I also found stocks tanking, that is,great shorts. Sure, you can find screamers at the open, but Iwas finding them during lunch, at 1:45 PM—any time I pushedthe button. I was so euphoric that I wanted to call every traderI knew. Of course, as a beta tester, I was not allowed to tellanyone.
I’m going to describe a few of HotScans’ many features. When HotScans is later mentioned as a
means for finding a trade in a specific strategy you will already be familiar with the tool.
Let me tell you a little about how HotScans works. It’s web based so I do not have to load any
software. I log in to HotScans in the morning and reduce it to the tool bar. Whenever I want to trade I justclick on the tool bar and push run. The returns are filtered and ranked, so the best trades are probably onthe top, but I am getting ahead of myself.
HotScansHotScans works in time increments; if you run a five-minute scan looking for rallying stocks, you can
pick up stocks that have just received, for example, a fresh cross on the ten. What has amazed me is thatwith the thousands of stocks on the three major exchanges, there is always some stock making a move. Itmight be a stock that was flat or down all day, but now it is beginning a rally. The same is true for shorts,they are just as easy to pick up, even in an up market. Although you may select a 5-minute scan, you canelect to have the program show you, and scan, another time frame in another column. Therefore, If youpick up a stock that is beginning to rally, you can also check on how it has performed since the open, duringthe last hour, or perhaps for the past twenty minutes.
The results of a scan are displayed in vertical green or red bars. A green bar represents an increase
in price movement or relative volume, a red bar graphically represents a decrease in price or relativevolume and are always displayed for each time frame selected. One bar represents the least movementand five the maximum. Occasionally a stock will be displayed with a “+” sign after the five bars—this is ascreamer. Earlier I mentioned  a stock that had a $4.60 move; it had five green bars with a “+” on both priceand relative volume—a certain winner. These are the stocks that are in play, the stocks that are driving themarket at that particular moment, or for that matter, the day. A stock with solid signals will run at the
open and keep on running all day . The following may help to clarify what is meant by the term relative
volume:
Relative Volume is a term that refers to the volume of a stock during a specific time
frame as compared to, or relative to, the volume this stock typically has for that timeframe. For example, if the average daily volume for a stock is 470,000 shares but on thisparticular day it is 1.7 million shares, there is a large increase in the stock’s relativevolume. Relative volume can be found for shorter time frames. For example, if a scanreveals that for the past twenty minutes a stock has had a 6,000% in increase in relativevolume, as compared to the average volume for that period, concurrent with a priceincrease, this indicates that a significant rally is under way. Scans can be run for periodsas short as five minutes, thus alerting the trader to fresh rallies, usually coinciding with afresh cross on a 10 or 30 minute chart on Wizetrade. Because of the large number ofstocks in the three major exchanges, rallies are available almost all of the time and canbe short or long.
In addition to scanning for rallies ( Rallying Now ) in various time frames, scans may also be run for
falling stocks and stocks with Big Volume Now . I ran Big Volume Now  towards the close of the market and
found the stocks most likely to gap the next morning, easy as pie. HotScans is also developing a wholeseries of presets that are trading strategies in themselves: Opening Range Breakout Up, Opening Range
Break Down; Day Traders At New Highs; At New Lows; Gaps Falling; and Gaps Following Through  are just
a few of them. Links will take the trader to Hot Stocks, Hot Groups, and Hot Sectors—another featurewhich will soon be available, allows the trader to access a select group of the two-hundred best stocks today trade based on average volume, bid and offer , opening range versus average trading range, total point
range, among other criteria. By linking to this group, you will know instantly which of these MarketGauge
200 are having the biggest intraday moves on big volume. To reiterate, every signal I have taken was
validated by Wizetrade and followed through as a profitable trade.
Does this sound complicated? My learning curve lasted about twenty minutes. It’s very intuitive and
I needed no instruction. In fact, there was no tutorial for the beta test (there is one now), and I did not needone. A little common sense won’t hurt, however.
Let’s look at an actual trade that I took before Christmas. I was looking for a long on one of those all
too often dreary trading days with no volume and negative indices. The scan, which you can view on thenext page, came up with twenty-five potential trades (it was mid morning), some long and some short; thescan was on the setting Big Vol. Now . On the next page, I will interpret the results of the first two returns
from the scan.
What are you waiting for? Turn the page.The first stock to come up was FE on the Big Volume Now  scan. Its current price is $32.89. It has lost
9¢ or 0.2% for the day. The fourth column shows one grey bar and one red bar. Every column has a greybar, this is the relative price or relative volume against which the comparisons are made. So, if you run ascan and find only a grey bar, therehas been no change. Anyway, thereis one red bar which indicates a littlebit of price movement to the down-side. In the next column there arefive green bars indicating a maxi-mum increase in relative volume;in fact, there has been a relativevolume increase of 778% duringthis twenty-minute time frame. One quick glance and I new that I was at the beginning of a very powerfulshort rally. I did not want a short, so I moved to the next line.
This was what I was looking for, a long. I’ll interpret the columns for you: BEAS was at $11.70 and up
58¢ for the day. It was now mid to late morning and I wanted another trade before lunch. Not really a goodtime to enter a long, unless it had strong signals. BEAS had 3 green bars under % of price change  for the
scan period and was apparently ramping up. Other columns revealed that although volume was down alittle for the day, it was very heavy during the period of the scan which was twenty minutes. I clicked BEASinto Wizetrade and viola (that’s twice I used that word), a rally was getting underway. I got in for about atwenty-five minute trade which produced about 80¢ and went to lunch. With this kind of relative volume,it’s never like watching paint dry.
Let me mention one other trade. On the second day, I looked for a long. I found a stock but failed to
notice that it was down -$3.86 for the day. I loaded it into Wizetrade only to discover that it had been a shortsince the open where it gapped and ran down for hours. It was 12:30 EST and was rallying to the upside.What did I find? Right, a dead-cat bounce. This particular trade was good for more than a point. I bet youknow what came next—right—a short. This was the setup for the next short as the stock returned to itsoverall trend. Since that time I look for these signals and have been able to find reversals, or dead-catbounces throughout the trading day: no muss, no fuss.
There are far too many features to cover in this e-book without becoming a tutorial for HotScans. If
you would like to take a look at this revolutionary product, go to 
www.marketgaug e.com and look for the
HotScans link.
HotScans draws on more thana month of historical data toevaluate a stock’s relativevolume, minute by minute.  Aquick glance at this shows astock, NBTY, that hasexperienced a relative volumeincrease of 437%, and for thepast five minutes, is thestrongest stock rallying at thisparticular minute in any of thethree major exchanges.
HotScans8: Day-Trading Strategies
Following are many of the day-trading strategies in use by Wizetraders. I selected a handful of
strategies that work well using the Wizetrade platform. Some of these strategies work best at the open oronly at the close, others require special light settings; I’ll point out any special requirements as we gothrough them. Often, there are one, two, or more methods for finding these trades, so I’ll try to identifythese also. Finding good trades has been the missing link ; using Wizetrade to enter and exit a trade is
rather straight forward, finding a great trade is far more difficult. In the end, it is up to you to define andadopt a trading style and have a trading plan which best matches your personality and resources.
We will begin the trading day with a gap up at the open:
Charlene’s Method and Finding Stocks That Will Gap at the Open
Description The purpose of this trade is to find stock that will run up or gap up in the open.
Technically, this is not a day trade since the entry is as the close of the previousmarket. Traders often refer to this strategy as overnight trading .
Advantage Requires only about and hour (maybe a little more) each day
Disadvantage Market may go against you at the open; there is always a degree of risk in holding
a stock overnight. This method works best when there is a rally on the open.
Caution Check 
www.earnings.com to make certain you are not holding a stock
that is going to announce the following morning. Also check the news onthe stock.
Finding the Trade Find stocks with a fresh cross on the day and watch the short minute
lights: 1, 2,  3, 5, and 10 especially. If the lights have good angle andseparation (at least 1 o’clock) and there is good volume, buy just beforethe close. Charlene likes to take profits no more than 40 minutes into theopen.
Optional Method Run HotScans looking for stocks that have significant increases in rela-
tive volume and price (5 green bars and possible a “+”). In the last 10minutes, run the scan in the 5-minute mode ( Big Vol, Now ) and check for
stocks that have an increase of more than 1000%. Place your best choicesin Wizetrade and check the short minutes lights, if they continue screaminginto the close, you have stocks that have a high probability of gapping and/orrunning in the open. Check them in Wizetrade and use the three Wizemen forconfirmation.
Jack’s System (Keakadog)
from notes posted on the Wizetrade Users Site  (Yahoo)
Description Jack trades the first hour or so of the market (sometimes longer from his posts)
and returns in the afternoon to look for potential trades for the next day. [Ed. Note:For those of you new to day trading, the big action is at the open and again duringthe last hour of the market. The open (first half hour) can be very volatile and riskyand is avoided my many traders.] For those of you who have watched the Boot
Camp Video Series,  Jack’s system continues to evolve. His original system called
for finding setups before the market opened. The following information comesfrom a series of posts on the message boards
Advantage Requires only about and hour (maybe a little more) each day
Disadvantages No real disadvantages except it does require good trading skills and has a very
time-consuming process of finding trades.
Finding the Trade Jack says he uses Wizefinder as the principal means for finding setups for his
morning list of starters. [Ed. Note: his original method called for finding stockswith a huge percentage move from the prior day that also had volume in themillions. The simplest method for screening for these stocks is to use the screener
on marketwatch.cbs.com.] He also uses smar tmoney.com, CNet’s tech stocks top
five high and lows each day and Investor’s.com but finds IBD not very helpful. All
of his picks from Wizefinder and other sources are percentage and volume based.He places a great deal of emphasis on volume. He does not have a set goal,rather he tends to stay with the lights until they give him exit signals. “Instead oftrying to work every nickel and dime out of the process, I try to remember to takesome of it off the table. That is why I am in and out of some trades several times.I don’t need to get it all, just the biggest part of it!”
Jack mentioned that he often uses the Gainers and Losers window looking for
stocks that have made at least a 5% move. He moves all of his potential choicesinto Wizetrade for evaluation. (Jack uses the Three Wizemen.) He also mentions:“If any of the picks go south quickly, I’m out of it and take my losses rather thanride them down.” He also mentions the importance of staying glued to the com-puter when in a trade.
Jack says: The first site I head to each morning (or the night before) is Wizefinder.
Next, I go to 
smartmoney.com. Go to the Market section then lick on Market
Movers. A new screen will pop up which will give you ten options for the stocksand the lists for the [three major exchanges]. I use 600,000 shares as the mini-mum volume and percentages above 5% to choose the stocks using the ten op-tions to cull for Wizetrade candidates; usually there are a small number of bothlong and short candidates resulting from this process every day. Next, I run themthrough Wizetrade to remove the weakest links and use the charts to rate thesurvivors as trading candidates.
In regard to Wizefinder he says: I set my parameters between $5 and $25 and
daily volume of 600,000, although I do look at the Wizefinder selections between35¢ and $5 just to see if there are any stocks in this group. Here I may allow atrading volume of 300,000. My logic here is that if they show as a long candidatewith the 180, day, week and month all showing good separation, I may take therisk. I wait until the market open to see how strong the direction is. I do not shortthis way. In other words, the cost is cheap and it usually does not cost me muchwhen I’m wrong. I just get out and move on to something else. However, When I’mright, these are usually my best dollar plays of the day.
Rockets
Description Rockets are those stocks that should shoot up in the open and possibly carry on
through the day.
Advantage The process of finding rockets is relatively quick. Setup work is not required the
previous evening. Many Wizetraders are claiming success with Rockets.
Disadvantages You are trading in the open. There is no way to check for relative volume. This
method works best when there is a rally on the open. Results are dependent onhow relevant your database is. Also, the database is restricted to 500 stocks. Youcannot screen the entire market using your database.
 Finding the Trade Run Gainers and Losers about 9:35 (EST). In order not to eliminate stocks at the
open, go the parameters section of Wizetrade and set volume to 8,000 and openup the spread. Run Gainers and Losers on Wizetrade; the first stock to come upwith volume is your rocket.
Optional Method Run HotScans looking for stocks that have significant increases in relative vol-
ume and price (5 green bars and possibly a “+”) beginning about 9:35 (EST). Runthe scan in the 5-minute mode ( Rallying Now ) mode. Place your best choices in
Wizetrade and check the short minutes lights. You may not be able to catch thetrade since they will be moving very fast. This is your decision; you may want towait for a pullback and a new entrance. These are the stocks that will move up allday.Rocket Theory With A Twist
posted on message board by Debbie Rogers
Description Rockets are those stocks that might shoot up in the open and possible carry on
through the day. Debbie Rogers supplied her version with a twist.
Description  Pre-market, I will look at the heat map and futures for a green and positive
trend
From market open at 9:30 to 9:45 go to Wizetrade’s G&L Biggest Gainers  and
pick the first fifteen stocks and enter them into Wizetrade; look at the 15-, 30- and60-minute charts for good angle and separation. If some of them don’t meet thecriteria get more from the Wizetrade Biggest Gainers  list. Try to fill the fifteen
windows in Wizetrade unless you run out of time.
Between 9:45 to 9:55 pick the one(s) that have the best angle and separation
in the 3-5-15-30- and 60-minute charts. Look for a fresh cross on the 3- and 5-minute charts. Why enter between 9:45 to 9:55? Because stocks tend to loosesome value the closer you get to 10:00 and you get a better ask price, then they
start back up right after 10:00.
Exit before 11:00. Stocks tend to go flat and it’s profit-taking time (just as be-
fore 10:00). Remain if your pick has solid-fuel tanks and it’s unstoppable.
` Exiting using the typical technique. If the 3- and 5-minute charts are tanking,
exit, or if the 15 is arching over to the 4-6 o’clock angle,  and the 30 min turnedred.
Finding Trades with a Little Homework
from a message from Patricia Valentine
Description Patrica Valentine uses a worksheet to select potential winners for the next trading
day.
Description After selecting the list of winners for the day, via Wizefinder, CBS Market Watch,
and Barcharts [ barchart.com] (I personally only scan $1-$10 stocks with a 10%
gain—as do many of us.) I cross check, select the top 25 or so, then I use the worksheet. I collect the data for the worksheet from Yahoo Finance. I like to use anaverage volume of greater than 500K however, sometimes I will go less if there isgood news or a good reason to consider a little lower volume. Then I look at thehistoric price for stocks that are below their 50-day high; once again, I will some-times trade those at their 50-day high if the news warrants it. I look at insiderbuying, the message board (which usually is a lot of nothing to pay attention to,but I do look), I look at the news (significant news goes under miscellaneous). Theselection process rules out low volume, and stocks at their 50-day high withoutsignificant news. I plug the remaining into wizetrade and look for the rockets. Ithen rate the wizetrade results on an scale of 1 - 10 (usually I just put that to theleft of the chart in the margin). My buy picks are the ones with the highest ratingon my list. I do miss sometimes, but on the whole it works fairly well for me.Parameters are:

xSCALPING: If you are new to day trading, many of the techniques,
such as the two above, involve sclaping. This term originallyapplied to fighting for the difference between the the bid and theask (spread) but has come to mean simply taking very short-term trades. There are day traders who buy at the open and remainall day, possibly trading one of the longer signals such as the150, 90 or 60. The trades that we are covering at the momentsometimes involve trading the very short lights. These are thetrades which carry the most amount of risk.Fail-safe Method
(notes from the message boards)
Description The Fail-safe Method is
in use by several expe-rienced traders withsuccess. They cautionthat this is strictly a day-trading method. If youare familiar with the 8Steps to Success, orhave not used theWizetade method suc-cessfully after papertrading for a month, thismethod may not be foryou. It has been usedfor both shorts and longs profitably. Trade in the direction of the “D” lights whichare the three longest minute lights. Use the lower minute lights, the “T” lights, totime your fresh cross 8 minute fresh-cross entry or exit. Obviously, if the threeWizemen are in sync with the “D” lights, you are far better off, but that is not arequirement. Timing the entry or exit with the overall market’s daily pivots is moreimportant. Once you are comfortable with going in the direction of the “D” lightsyou can trade against them which is more risky but often very profitable. Remainaware of the of the location of previous support and resistance on the Wizetradechart when you set objectives entries and exits. As with any system new to you, trypaper trading first until you gain the comfort level you require. (SongmanV)
Finding the Trade This is a day-trading light setup and does not address finding trades.
Optional Method Steve writes: “My lights are 1 2 4 8 12 24 78 D . I rarely use Three Wizemen If
you’re a beginner, I would suggest you use 3WM until you get the hang of this. Iwatched these stocks for a few months before I became comfortable with the styleI trade. I do however always use FAST. Sometimes I enter on the open using the1-minute light. For the most part I will use the fresh 2. For my exit strategy I getout when I’m satisfied with my profit or when the trade STARTS to go against me.I don’t use any stop orders because my trades happen quickly for the most part soI stay at the computer and in my case, watching my profits go down is the beststop I can use. The way I trade is a little risky and I wouldn’t recommend it for
beginners. I play the ups and downs in these stocks which means that all my lightsare rarely in agreement. As I stated in my previous post, I spent a lot of time justwatching the way these stocks move and doing nothing but that. The best adviceI can give you is take your time with this. You will make your share of money soonenough so don’t jump in unprepared.”Failsafe Method

Description This system of fast trading is often referred to as John Tuma’s Method. John
brings to the day trader the ultimate in fast scalping with his FASTER method.[The following description comes from a handout John distributed at the 2002Wizefest.]
Execution Some stocks tend to have long smooth runs during the day and others seem to be
very unstable. These runs can last from 20 to 45 minutes. The key is being able tofind the stocks that behave this way and then identify when these runs start. Theruns are found using the fast technique. It uses the same concept as the day,week, and month with the exception that it is much faster. In addition to having
long smooth runs, the stocks need to have significant variations when they aremoving. I look for three things in a stock. It must have large volume, significantvariations in price every day, and it must have several longs smooth runs eachday. With this technique, you don’t care what the market is doing of what the stockis doing. All you care about is that each stock varies about 10% each day and ithas long smooth runs on the five-minute chart. You must watch your stocks andwait for all the lights between the 1- and 5-minute to be the same color. What Ihave found is that if the 5-minute charts are strong, up or down, with good separa-tion and the 1-minute is not converging, that trend will probably continue for an-other 2 to 10 minutes. Sometimes it may go for 20 to 30 minutes.
Finding Stocks John uses Wizefinder to find stocks; these are his parameters:
Trades at least 5 million shares, on average, per day.
Less than $10 in price. I use a $10 maximum because you can buy a lot of
shares with a small amount of money. In addition, the spread is very small,typically no more than 2¢.
The price of the stock varies about 10% every day.  All you care about is the
percent of change. To determine the variation, enable the pop-up screen inthe parameters section of Wizetrade. Slide the cursor across the bottom ofthe 1-day chart and look at the high and low for each day. Just estimate 10%as you check each stock. A 10% change in $5.68 stock is roughly 60¢. That is,it might vary between $5.23 and $5.79. Don’t get hung up on exactly 10%, weare looking for about 10%.
The stock makes long smooth runs with good separation on the 5-minute
chart. (A long run is 20 to 40 minutes.) A good example is SEBL and a bad oneis PALM.
The lower the price is, the higher the volume needs to be.
[John buys in 1000 share lots of less than $20,000. For example, $9.76 = 2000shares; $4.25 = 4000; $2.56 = 6000. He only buys 5000 - 6000 shares on highvolume stocks. He doesn’t buy more than 6,000 because these trades move toofast.]
Execution John sets his lights to 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 plus the Day, Week and Month. To identify
5-minute trends, wait for the 5-minute lights to turn. You need to have a freshcross on the 5-minute chart with good angle and separation (FAS). Once you haveFAS on the 5-minute chart, look at the 1-minute chart. It must have good angleand separation and not be converging. John says: “Be patient. Don’t jump in toofast. These runs happen several time each day. Wait for them. Make your buy orsell decision only on the 1-minute chart (never on the color of the light). ”
Once you are in the trade, look only at the 1-minute chart. To decide when to
get out, watch the angle of change. The lines on the 1-minute chart are alwaysmoving and usually rapidly. The green and red will switch many times during along run. If you are long, watch the angle of the green line. If it goes flat or closeto flat, keep watching. It can go to a 4 o’clock angle and that’s OK. If it changessharply (greater than 4 o’clock) get out. A 1¢ change on 6000 shares is $60. Thebeauty of this technique is that you will ride the gains as long as they go, but will
get out quickly if it turns around. You minimize your losses this way. The gains faroutweigh the losses.
Other Information To use this trading strategy, it is imperative that you have a direct access (ECN)
trading platform with level II data feed. (John uses Carlin Equities.) John alwaysuses market orders and mentions that because of the high volume of the stockshe trades, upticks occur very rapidly (important when shorting).

West-Coast Offense
(notes from the message boards)
Description Markie writes that this is a good scalping strategy for the last half hour of the
market. It may work well for the folks who have a view of the Pacific Ocean anddon’t want to get up too early to day trade.
Execution With one hour left in the session, go into Wizefinder and search for NASDAQ only
stocks with the highest percentage gain for the day. Look for a well-developed daywith good separation (no bounces). Look for stocks that are $10 and up with aminimum volume of 500,000 (average daily volume). Then, with 45 minutes left inthe market, start watching for lots of good scalps.
Note: This is also a potential entry into a swing trade. If you plan to hold overnight,
then you should have entered the trade on a fresh cross on the Day with strongWeek and Month charts.
Shorting Tips
(notes from the message boards)
[Jim on Shorting in response to someone who had just taken a loss in his first short]
Shorting is not upside-down-buying long. It is easy to short (using a limit entry). But it is not easy to
set the stop for shorting. It requires strong character for you to execute the cover (accepting a loss) whenbased only on a signal bell you set on an eSignal chart. The Wizetrade short interval graphs themselvesprovide one of the best stops for a short position. If you were wrong, Wizetrade will show it. Because of theuptick rule, right from the start youwill have a small market moveagainst you plus the spread andcommissions. Count on having threecharges against your account forshorting.
Here is how I set a stop for my
day-trading account. I try to limit mylosses to around $100, which on 500shares I consider to be 20¢ from theentry point. On 300 shares I wouldallow 30¢ ($90). You would only en-ter a short when the stock is run-ning high volume. Of course, youlook at the recent top and the gen-eral market. One-minute eSignalvolume colors will switch from gen-erally green to generally red. Youwant to see the change of stock
momentum momentum momen/location location locationGary writes about using the TICK and TRIN for timing your entry.This applies to any pick when you are going long. It’s difficultto make money in this very volatile market so you want to havethe odds in your favor. There are 3 leading indicators which Irecommend you watch during the trading day. They are the TICK,TRIN, and S&P Futures index. I will keep this short but in generalbefore you buy your stock check the TICK and make sure it’spositive (number of stocks ticking up is greater than the numberof stock ticking down on NYSE). The TRIN measures volatilityand has an inverse relationship to the TICK. When advancingstocks dominate volume flow, the number reads under 1.0. Whendeclining stocks command volume flow, the number exceeds1.0. You want the TICK positive (usually a range of 200 to 600)and the TRIN below .9 when you execute your trade. Also whenthe TRIN exceeds 1.5, watch for stocks to rebound and whenTRIN is less than .4 watch for a sell off. Similarly, when theTICK approaches 1000 watch for a sell off and when it’s -600 to-1000 watch for a rebound. Also watch the trend of the S&Pfutures  index on 5 minute chart.  ($TICK and $TRIN)ownership from strong hands to weak hands. This means you have to pick the turn down closely. Two
signals that will greatly increase your likelihood of a successful short position are: (1) having the TRINindex somewhere around 0.40 (Ed. note: information about TRIN can be found at 
http://www .stockcharts.com/
education/What/IndicatorAnalysis/indic_TRIN.html, and (2) having mysterious high volume spikes appearin the stock, along with very little price motion (one-minute chart). There is one rule that must be followedwhen shorting: DO NOT ever short a quiet market. Do not break this rule. This means shorting in the DeadZone can be the riskiest time of the day. A quiet market can explode to the upside at any moment. Beforetaking a stock down, market makers will often run the stopsof the shorts. No use taking you along for the ride. There canbe a dramatic rise off a quiet market. If the stock is goingdown, this raid on the stops is all over in a few minutes. Asight to behold. The market is crooked? The market makerswill give you head fakes to sucker you into taking a short position and then run the stops against you?Naaaaahhhh. Don’t even think of it. They are nice guys. They aren’t that desperate for easy money (not).With any luck at all you just might get a short away somewhere near the end of a panic short covering rally.(MACD and CCI help here.) But once all the shorters have bought back their positions, the stock may turnand then fall like a stone. Shorting such a downside leg is very difficult.
The Heatmap Strategy
Description The Heatmap Strategy appears to be a straightforward, relatively easy tactic to
implement. However, it appears by all the chatter on the message boards, that anumber of Wizetraders have added their own twists. These variations and com-mentary will be presented here. This is a strategy to play the market open.
Procedures The original method, which I was taught, was to evaluate the NASDAQ pre-mar-
ket Heatmap (
NASDAQ.com and follow the links). I remember Mark McDonnell
saying that you should look for a stock that has moved at least 2.5%, with the bestvolume possible. If you are going long, then you won’t enter at the open unless allof the indices are long; if you plan on shorting a stock, then all of the indicesshould point to a short opening.
I always thought of this as a strategy to play at the open. However, the following is
from Vic West (message board): “With all other indicators correct for a heatmapplay, you enter in pre-market around 9:15AM and exit quickly after the open. It ispre-market gap strategy. [Uh Oh, it’s now a pre-market gap play.]
However you decide to play this strategy, there are a few things to consider:
Cautions First of all, a market maker friend of mine told me that he thinks only pros should
play in the pre-market. “It’s far too dangerous for all but the professional trader.”
You must enter with a limit order.Consider that the heat map shows only one-hundred NASDQ stocks, not the en-
tire NASDAQ or the entire market, so you are limiting your choices for a run up orgap up at the open.
This is a tough market and if you enter pre-market, the indices have a nasty habit
of late of flipping or turning against you at the most inopportune times.
Finally, I have used this strategy a number of times with the intention of entering
at the open. Many times, a stock that is displaying strength in the pre-market justdoesn’t perform as advertised.  So use this strategy with a great deal of caution.
If you are looking for a gap in the open, you might wish to consider Charlene’s
Method or the optional HotScans method at the previous close.Keeping tabs on the QQQs and/or in-dex, plus volume will give you thesignals everytime.Breakouts/Breakdowns
Description A fellow trader named Mike Gorchav developed this system about a year ago and
we traded it exclusively for quite a while, at least until we tired of all the prepara-tion. The purpose of this strategy is to have a steady stream of trades all day. Allof these trades are break outs or break downs because of the method in which thisstrategy is structured,. Personally, I prefer playing reversals, second stage rallies,and rallies, but; I used the system with some success for quite a while.
Procedures The following steps must be followed, some every evening:
1. Make a list of about 50 of your favorite trading stocks. In Mike’s case, he
chose the 50 stocks that had the greatest volume. I picked stocks with reason-able volume that had the largest average daily range. I also limited my selec-tions to stocks that traded at least 1-million shares on average per day.
2. Once you have chosen a list of stocks, you need not change them every
evening, but you are free to add or delete stocks from the list.
3. Every evening or after the market, you must set a trigger to buy or sell short
for each of the stock on your list. Each stock will have two triggers, one forlongs and one for shorts. For a long trigger add 6¢ to the currents day’s high.For short triggers, subtract 6¢ from the current day’s low.
4. Set up alerts. Many trading platforms allow you set up alerts. Some are so-
phisticated and have popups, others send e-mails. There were days when Ihad so many alerts I couldn’t look at them all.
5. At the open, eliminate any stocks that gap. Period. They are not in play for the
day.
6. When you get an alert, treat it as any potential Wizetrade. Evaluate the charts,
look at the indices, and be sure to check the volume. Most of the time theseare profitable trades since they are breaking up or down past short term resis-tance or support.
Follow-up or Secondary Runs
Description I have repeatedly observed that when I find a stock that is in play (food stocks—
not) that is, a stock that is driving the market on a huge increase in relative vol-ume, the stock will often pull back and give the trader a second trading opportu-nity. Earlier I mentioned a stock that I found afterit had already run up 2 points ($2). Later in themorning it pulled back on the 10-minute light (8-minute for you sophisticated traders) and com-menced another run for $2.60. This isn’t your ev-ery-day rocket, this is the monster of the day .
When you find it, stay with it no matter what.
Finding the Trade In this case, I’m looking for a one-day-wonder.
Since I’m a day trader and will NOT hold over-night, I really am not concerned about what hap-pens the following day. I’m looking for a stockthat will move at least 2 points or considerablymore before the close. On a good day, which I’lldefine as any day with volume sustaining throughout the day, not just the open, Irun HotScans (
www.Marketgaug e.com) about 10 minutes into the open. I’ll run
both Rallying Now (or Falling Now)  and Big Volume now and compare notes on
the top 2 or 3 stocks. (Note: HotScans updates automatically every minute so youcan just watch it.) I look for huge increases in relative volume, 1000% or more—and I’ve got a monster long or short to play all day.
Stalking and Variations on Stalking
Description Sometimes I refer to this strategy as parking on a stock . This past September, I
followed one stock for a solid w eek, paper trading the 30-minute chart. It was a
stock with a large daily range (it may have been AMGN) and tended to be goingsomewhere all the time, up or down. Allowing for slippage when it changed direc-tion, and assuming 1000 shares per trade, the stock would have earned the traderbetween $12,000 and $15,000 in one week (going long and short). “But I miss thefresh crosses you say.” Not if you only trade one stock. Does this sound too goodto be true? Does this sound easy? It’s not. It’s really emotionally tough. There areperiods when nothing is happening and that little voice says: “Let’s take a quickpeek at LLTC, or COF, orMXIM, or KLAC---“uh oh,missed a fresh cross AGAIN!”I once stalked EBAY for threehours and it did not move morethan a penny in either direc-tion (it finally gave up 50¢ atthe close).
Variations Another way to insure rela-
tively good and frequenttrades is to put up 2, 3, or 5 atthe most stocks on your firstpage. How about four stocksand the QQQs, or the TRIM,or the SPYs if applicable? Noother stocks; nothing justaround the corner on the sec-ond page that will tempt youto take quick peeks. Thesemight be the same stocks ev-ery day. There are advantagesto trading the same stocks.You get to know them and howthey trade, and I have foundthis to be a very satisfyingmethod of trading.
Another variation on the same theme is to have three pages of stocks. After the
market has shaken out during the first ten minutes, use the up and down arrowkeys on Wizetrade to scroll through the 150 (130, 180) and see which stocks havea fresh cross or strong 150 at the open. Depending on the indices (long or short)move your best potential trades to the first page. Stay there. No peeking. YouWILL get some trades during the day. (I’m, going to ask George Thompson, thesoftware architect, the put a page lock  on future upgrades.)
Since there is not setup work, you have your evenings free. Another bonus, you
will tend to have several trades throughout the day. I know I shouldn’t have tomention this, but please don’t pick three semiconductor stocks, or four biotechs. Iknow one Wizetrader who trades only the gold stocks. If you mix it up, you have amuch better chance of finding something that’s moving for the day. I like to havea financial, a semiconductor, a biotech, maybe a home builder, or maybe a retailstock. It’s your choice, but don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If you just have,for example, only chip stocks, you will find that they trade almost in lock stepanyway, so you will only get one trade when they all move together.“In all my months of research and couplemonths of trading, I came upon a style thatbest fits me. I stalk stocks. I play QLGC,KLAC, MXIM and some other tech stocksbecause of their volatility. I’ve watched thesestocks religiously for the last 7 months or so. Itrade in 1000 shares lots and only need a 10¢move to make $100. If you look at thosestocks I play, they move $1.50 + almost everyday. I have Wizetrade to show me the trendand I watch these stocks every day, so it’s nothard to make my goal of $300-$500 a day. Addthe numbers up, and you come out with $6000a month. This did not happen overnight. Istarted trading with Wizetrade in June and nowI often make more than my goal. This worksfor me. What works for you may differ and youmay be successful or you may not. Wizetradeis a trading TOOL and when used correctly,can be a very powerful tool. This is just oneman’s experience and let me add, a veryhappy man.”

Finding Shorts and Longs All Day Long
Introduction Have you noticed that most of the strategies used by Wizetraders, and for that
matter all day traders, focus on the open and the close? That’s because it hasbeen so difficult to find good trades once we are well into the market (see Stalk-ing). As mentioned earlier, being a beta tester for HotSans (
marketgauge.com)
has been an eye opener. The last three or four months have changed the way Itrade throughout the day. I used to work on setups and try to catch a good tradewith momentum at the open, sometimes at the close. I’d spend long hours watch-ing a few stocks during the day hoping for an entrance, often to be disappointed.That’s changed. Now I find potential trades throughout the day, usually when Iwant them. With about 7,000 stocks trading in the three major exchanges, there isalmost always a stock making a move on huge relative volume. The problem hasbeen finding these moves in time to get a trade. HotScans has solved this prob-lem—but I get ahead of myself.
Definitions A rally simply defines a stock making a big move (long or short). Not a situation
where you might be forcing a trade , or the charts aren’t strong enough. A big move
has momentum. Remember, price change + high increase in relative volume
= momentum  (see p. 17 for definition). These are the trades that most day trad-
ers want. Simply put: great longs or shorts. However, these trades occur underdifferent circumstances and you should understand the different types of rallies sothat you can setup your search for them.
Types of Rallies Following are some of the different situations under which rallies may occur:
1. A stock runs up, pulls back hard, then reverses into another rally.
2. A stock has been a short and then reverses to a long ( dead cat bounce ).
3. A stock has been trading flat and suddenly breaks up or down .
4. A long reverses and becomes a strong short.
Setting Up HotScans Hot scans allows you to screen within certain parameters. First of all, you select
the price ranges, for example $5 to $15. Next, you check your volume require-ments. HotScans asks if you wish to include the overall daily trend; I always checkthis box. Another box asks how often you wish the program to refresh: your choicesrange from never to every 10 minutes. I set mine at one minute. Finally, you canclick on the Pop Out. This creates a free-floating box which you can overlay onthe Wizetrade software. That’s it, you are done. (But you didn’t tell me how itworks! OK, I’ll do that in the next section.)
HotScans Setups If you checked Display Daily
Gauges, you will immediately
be able to evaluate how thestock has been doing since theopen. This includes the currentprice, price change since theopen, percent of price change,and today’s relative volume ver-sus average volume. The greenand red bars are explained onpage 18. A quick glance at theexample to the right shows thefirst stock has had a huge in-crease in both daily relativevolume as well as percent ofprice change.
HotScansNow we get to the good part. In addition to the daily data, you can have two more
columns (sets of data) which have filters. In other words, you can control thesearches. I’ll give a few examples of how I use these filters to find specific tradingopportunities.
Setting the Filters Just to orient you, the first set of data quickly indicates how the stock has been
performing for the day. If the scan indicates the stock has been strong all day, youcan expect to have very strong long-minute lights. You are in an overall longtrend. A quick look at the number of green bars will let you know how strong thattrend really is.
The second set of columns shows price change (amount and percent) and strength
for the rally period you selected. Again, you can quickly judge how strong themovement is by looking at the green bars. You can also see, for example, theamount of change in the relative volume. I like rallies that have more than 300%to 400% change in relative volume, or higher. You may select the time frame forthe filter. Suppose you choose 5-minutes; you will find stocks that have beenmoving on huge relative volume for the past five minutes. So you quickly realizethat you have a stock with a strong daily up trend that has been rallying for fiveminutes. It gets even better.
You have a third set of columns (data) which also has a time filter. This allows you
to see how the stock has performed in the time frame just before you ran the scan,that is, a period of time (which you select) before the scan. Suppose you choosetwenty minutes. You may find that there has been little change or a light retrace-ment, then at this point, you already know what you will find before going to theWizetrade charts: a stock in a strong daily long trend that has rested for a while(consolidated or slightly retraced) that is beginning a new rally.
By using the filters, you can come up with almost any kind of trade. Yesterday the
market was short (downward trending) and I like to play “V” shaped reversals,sometimes called dead-cat bounces. I set the filter on the 2nd column for 5-minute
rallying now. The filter in the 3rd column was set to scan a 30-minute time frame.I ran a scan (about 3 seconds) and noticed that IBM was down a few points. It hadreally been hammered. The second set of data indicated that it was rallying stronglyas a long (more than 900% increase in relative volume), and the 3rd set of datashowed that in the period before the rally, IBM was dropping like a rock. I loadedIBM in Wizetrade and found a strong reversal. (If you wish to view this trade, go toJanuary 15th, IBM.) I caught one or two boxes on the 8-minute chart in Wizetrade.From where I caught it, it moved more than a point. The long-term lights were stillred (typical in a dead-cat bounce) and IBM eventually reverted to a short. A greatshort by the way—two trades for the price of one.
Therefore, by looking at the daily trend first and setting your two filters, you will
know ahead of time what kind of trade you will find. I know that I must sound likea pro, but my learning curve, that is, the time it took me to learn the system, wasless than five minutes.
It is my understanding that many of these setups will have presets, thus eliminat-
ing the need to use the filters unless you are looking for something out of theordinary.9: Some Final Thoughts
When I began writing this e-book, I wanted to explain which light to use for an exit, now I
realize that to really do justice to the art of day trading, it would take a five-hundred page book.I hope that you have found this information useful, possibly thought provoking, or at least notboring. If you are new to trading or day trading, perhaps this information will serve as some sortof an orientation to the profession since I endeavored to present an overview. As I wrote, I wasconstantly aware of more and more information that might be included, but there were otherconsiderations as well. Since there are so many graphics imbedded in what was created as apostscript document, I had to keep it small enough to qualify for e-mailing. This final document isabout 40 MHz and compressed to a barely acceptable size in PDF format.
I did not cover all the day-trading strategies that a pro might use. For example, there are
techniques for playing the news, earnings announcements and on and on. But, I did try to presenta range of useful strategies that many day traders employ. It is important that you identify the oneor two that work best for you and stick with them. Become an expert and you will profit.
We are trading in a very difficult environment as I write this final page. This only hones our
trading skills. If you can succeed even a little in this market, and develop your skills to the fullest,there is little doubt that you will be immensely successful when the market gradually returns.
I know that when we meet at the next Wizefest, I am going to be asked several questions
over and over. I might as well answer them now. I have been trading with Scottrade. Periodicallythere are disasters. They goofed recently and cost me $105. I’ve had three great completedtrades canceled, the trading platform disappear from the Web, and more horror stories then youwould care to hear. Suffice to say, I have switched to direct access trading 
(http://
directaccesselite .com/) which my professional trader friends (guys who trade for hedge funds)
believe is the most sophisticated trading platform available today. (If you call for a price, ask forthe MG rate.)
I trade on a relatively powerful computer; this makes all the difference. Since I bought the
new computer and XP Pro, I have never had to re-boot during the trading day. I defrag and cleanout cookies and other rubbish at least once per day. I also have a program running called AdDeletewhich stops cookies and popup ads (free download). I had the computer built for me with a dual-head video card so that I can run two monitors. I’m also setting up a second computer to run mye-mails. Originally I had DSL but had constant problems so I switched to cable and it has beengreat. So much for equipment. I have returned to watching traditional charts since they give mea quick heads up when a stock begins to move. I have difficulty in catching these moves onWizetrade since I cannot see the charts. I can also spot setups much more easily on a bar chart.
Although I covered many trading strategies, some of them scare me to death. In fact, some
of them are so risky that the pros won’t touch them. If you are a new trader, I would avoid the firstfew minutes of the market and certainly keep out of the pre- and after-markets. Sure, you’ll winsome, but you may also take a real beating, I know I have. The older I get and the more experi-ence that I have under my belt, the more conservative I become. This is a profession and as Iapproach each trading day, I do not want an adventure, thank you. It’s all about managing risk.
I know that you will ask me about my light setup. I have several. In fact, I have experimented
with so many day-trading setups I’ve lost count. I’m going to mention briefly some conclusionsthat a friend and I have reached after more than a month of analyzing the best way to useWizetrade for day trading. This friend is a professional with decades of experience using manytypes of setups. I do, however, wish to make these observations in the context of what I hear inthe Wizetrade Users’ Group e-mails. First of all, I see more light setups that Kelloggs has cornflakes. Everyone seems to be searching for the right setup. Furthermore, few seem very confi-dent in the signals, and some are trading the 1-minute lights. Heck, Wizetrade might just as wellhave been built with a 1, 3, and 5. Maybe the following will help a little since everyone seems tobe searching for the perfect method.The lights (charts) have certain mathematical, that is, proportional relationships. You don’t
really need too many lights. These relationships apply to any light setup. Within a light setup, youwill have the chance to trade within different time frames from long day trades to quick scalps.However, the relationships and function of the lights will not change.
Each light should be some percentage of the next light. If you are using a 180, for example,
the next lights should be considerably smaller, otherwise a move in a shorter light will destroy thetrend in the longer light while recycling, or as my friend says, “you will be forever chasing yourtail” (waiting for setups). Each light, depending on how much of a move you wish to capture,plays a specific role in the decision-making process. If you wish to shift to shorter lights, all thethe roles shift, but the relationships remain the same. I’d like to say that your light setup governsyour trading style, but in fact, you take what you get. You can only take what the market givesyou. That is, you can only play the signals as they arrive; I believe that some people keeptinkering with the lights hoping they will get a trade. Example: “I have a red 180, maybe if Ichange it to a 130 it will be green”—I’ve been there, have you? How about this one: “the 180 isembryonic, maybe if I change it to a 130 it will be stronger.”
In the following setup the relationship (proportion) of the lights to each other, and how you
play them as a system or method for trading, is one that makes sense.
I show the Day Chart since there is room for it and also because it may indicate the overall
strength of a stock’s trend. However, I will day trade against the day light; it is NOT in play.
The three primary trading lights are the 180, 60, and 20. Notice the relationship; each is
one-third of the preceding light, that is, they are well spread out. Each of these lights has a roleto play in the system.
You could actually trade just these three lights but you
need one more light to act as the timing trigger. In this case,either the 5 or the 8. The 8 is a better trigger in the currentexample. In this setup, the 180 only has to have a greensignal (not pointing down), and can have the most embry-onic of crosses. The 60, however, must be very strong andnot overextended. The 20 should be relatively fresh andyou enter on a fresh cross on the 8-minute chart. Ideally, the 8 and 20 willcross at about the same time. The 1and 3 play no real role except for aheads up and possibly finessing theexit. This kind of setup has the poten-tial to develop into a longer trade al-lowing you to capture much larger moves than you wouldif you allow yourself to be shaken out by the short minutelights. Forget them, trade the 60 if it remains strong ordiverges. If not, try to follow the 20. If the 8 turns red, sowhat; you might be shaken out with 20¢ on what might be a point move. Let the 8 recycle, that’swhat it does for a living, try to follow longer lights if your goal is to capture the bigger moves.
Suppose you see this setup but the 8 is strong and getting stronger and you missed it. Quite
honestly, by waiting for the 8 to recycle you might miss a huge move. Well, you can take thistrade, just move your trigger to a shorter light such as the 5, 3, or even the 1. Just be aware thatthis might be a much shorter trade because you entered late. Be ready to sell or cover when youlose the 8.
It is important that as a day trader, you are aware of your trading style and your goals. Ask
yourself, do I want to capture the big move or do I just wish for a quick scalp? Your answer willdictate how you use this above example and setup. Following is another example which mightmake the method a little clearer as you interpret setups in Wizetrade.

minDayTiming LightsHere is an example of the same light setup but the roles of the lights have been shifted over
one light (a move to shorter lights). Notice that the longest light, for trading purposes, is now the60 which only has to be in the direction of the trade. Be-cause the lights have been shifted to shorter time frames,and in order to keep the mathematical proportion betweenthe trigger and the 8-minute light, the 3 could be used asthe trigger. Each time the time frames are shortened, so isthe potential length of the trade. When entering on a 3-minute light, the trader should expect a far shorter trade.Moving the lights again would begin to qualifyas the setup for the 
FASTER method men-
tioned earlier in the trading strategies section.Also, the shorter the time frame used, themore nimble you have to be, thus increasingthe risk of the trade. Using a 20-minute light,for example, as your longest indicator doesn’tgive you much of a trend within which to trade.
I should also mention that when playing a dead-
cat bounce or a “V” reversal, that’s probably all thesignal you are going to get.
The amount of risk you are willing to assume is part of your trading style. Only you know
your skills and your pain tolerance threshold. If you are new to day trading, I would suggesttaking the most conservative approach. The safest style of all is trading with the three Wizemenin your favor, but I rarely find everything lined up perfectly. By working with just minute lights, atleast you have the opportunity to trade frequently, and profitably I might add.
Here are a few rules of the many dozens that a day trader must observe:
 Don’t watch too many stocks, focus, focus, focus.
 Always get a fresh cross on some light and know ahead of time what your goals for the trade
are.
 Be patient; it takes time for a trade to set up. Don’t force a trade; if it’s not ready, wait or pass. Stocks trade better on different lights; change your lights if necessary until you find the one
that makes it easiest to trade a stock.
 Don’t anticipate a cross, even if you see the price running up, wait for the right signal. Don’t average down. Building a position is fine, however. Avoid stocks where the run is long in the tooth.
Avoid breakout fakeouts and breakdown fakeouts.
 Don’t worry about the price, worry about the charts. Fine tune (time) your entrance; timing really is everything.
 Don’t change your style if it works for you.
