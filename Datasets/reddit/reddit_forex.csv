Why you should never trade on a phone with a curved screen,1928,https://i.redd.it/6ida6zn3kls41.jpg,"WSB is down the hall to the left mate.

What the hell is even the point of these curved screens besides making everything suck and be annoying
 FTFY: Why you should never buy a phone with a curved screen
Or even more, trade on a phone in general
Market makers hate this trick
Flatten the curve
*Why you should never buy a phone with a curved screen.
Just never trade on a phone
This is how r/wallstreetbets trade their trades

LOOOLLLL F in chat boys 😔😔
OOOF this is so sad
You can turn it off, I did
Lol
Usually the price is on that side. So the issue is more with that app
😂😂😂
lol
Haha, who has the axis on the left hand side though?
omg thats brilliant-not-brilliant.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is what they mean by, ""it's s around the corner""!
This is hilarious
😂😂😂
Hahahhhah
Whats is the point of curved screen?
OMFG, that is crazy…. and the worst thing in the world
Literally falling of the edge 😂
I am of the opinion that one shouldn't trade on phones at all. 

A decent computer / laptop. Good tools needed to be great at your task. Simple.
What's the best way to create **Indicator based Alerts on Forex**?

I've created one with TradingView when Gold crosses 50 EMA,

but i want to know whether it can be done somewhere for free or inside MetaTrader itself?
What is the purpose of these phones?
Damn, that’s crazy!!
🫠🤣
Blame Samsung. They invented this shitty idea.
😂😂 me with a oneplus
Terrible
lolllll
Dw I've seen the shenanigans of there already loool
everything turns into WSB at some point
😂😂yea i just left that room its a bunch of idiots over there, im going back in tho👀
hahahahaha
Charts were fixed on to the screen? Lol
It's to make you accidentally press everywhere along the borders and cause random stuff to happen.
Crack tour screen so you have to get another one
Yeah, I never understood how distortion along both edges of the screen was a useful feature.
You have legs, and I have legs, your legs are different than mine. Just because I may walk a bit differently to get to the same location, doesn’t mean that it can’t get the job done.  The portability of being able to follow your trades on a phone as you go about your day adds to much convenience, and increased reaction time. Don’t knock trading on a phone. I’d rather trade anywhere I please, instead of being stuck in one room, and only being able to access trading from that one room.  Profits are still profits at the end of the day.
If you knew how much I make on my phone you would beg me to teach you 😉😘.

Enjoy being an asshole.
Hold the power button for 3-5 seconds
It's kewl
Oneplus doesn't curve anywhere near as hard as that. You can easily see the edges from the front.

Making $20+ million dollars in a couple months is  shenanigans?
You must scalp on the 1-minute chart
I read the shitposts for a bit of a laugh
$20+ million fake dollars
Scalping on the 1-minute is as crazy as trying to fight underwater with the Kraken.
Someone woke up with shit oozing out of their adult diaper this morning, didn’t he :(
Lol. Everybody has their own strategies. 1 minute charts don’t provide you with enough information for a clearer picture.  My most important charts I follow prior to deciding to take a trade or not is the hourly, and monthly charts. What are some of your preferred methods to justify placing a trade? I still appreciate the humour of your post even if you don’t agree with my viewpoints.
I have a million dollars…. In Schrute bucks
No it's a guy named wsbgod. Verified multiple times.

Not saying it's skill, what he did was just gambling.

The way I trade is skill. Which is why I am consistently profitable for 6+ years.
🫡 wish me luck mate
I trade weekly options/futures. And can tell even though the op is a turd, you wanted an honest answer. I find the weekly and monthly hold up the best. Even if the weekly looks bad, the monthly chart+weekly volume will differentiate between a bad week and a bad position. The minute/1d charts are only good for determining when to open/close a position you already studied for. I'll only take the 6m/1y when studying if the stock is even worth me looking at in the first place. 

So I like em all. I like charts. Give me all the charts.

*Strong name to brag beta*
Lmao.  I loved that analogy of ripping a McLaren down a highway at 75.  You’re right though.  I feel like I actually took something away from your comment there.  All charts need to be focused on really.  Not just a select few.  They all contribute to the bigger picture.  I guess the 1 minute charts do have a place in my heart after all.
Yes, but lucky for you, my system is real and works 200% of the time, and when you download my videos you'll learn the secret to make BILLION$. Only $99 for a subscription. I'm practically giving it away! Why? Because I want you to make $$BILLIONS$$. Haters will say it's fake.

Feel free to ask me questions.

Treat the practice account like it's real.

Once you go live, start with $100-500, just something you can afford to blow up, because you will.

Take it seriously and have fun. It's only money.

Mine and Golds current relationship hahahasadbois
When you finally get in the trend.. chances are so is everyone else lol. This mentality is shared
The market fluctuates in a way thats designed to either frighten you to accept your current loss or stop you out. More often than not, you can and should ride the current trend. 

Long = set stop loss underneath previous prevalent higher low, use average true range to avoid volitality stop outs 

Short = same thing but above previous prevalent lower high

Basically stack all the buffs you can to win, nothing is too much if it helps you win and read charts efficiently.

If you're losing consistently and cant find the hole - start it all over again.

Ps. I'm no pro, I've just been getting my ass kicked around long enough to understand how to win. 

Also buy a whiteboard if you can it helps. :)

Look at smart money concept strategy
That's because it is.
It is.
Resistances are fake, they only work as long as big players decide they are defending those prices. When they have to seek liquidity elsewhere those levels are crossed like butter. Trading around supposed support and resistance levels is a losing method (my opinion)
Same. Or takes out SL and then goes in the direction I wanted
Pingu :)
ya and then it shoots up further  (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
Do the opposite of what you think then.
What's that
Just look at client sentiment and do the opposite if there’s a strong bias towards one side. Pretty effective since the institutions will push against the mass consensus to maximize profits so you’ll be trading with the institutions.
by the big banks, think like the big banks and institutions and watch your profits soar
Blablblablaa
Hahahaha he just answerd his own question but he doesn't believe it 😂😂😂
It’s because most people make the same error to base their decision ONLY by one single evidence. As I like to think about TA is that it’s based with DIFFERENTS EVIDENCES. For example you can’t just trade with R&S but you could try to add more things like a good volume indicator with a good volume analysis. You would discover that the 95% of the time the price break trough your trend line or R&S the volume has warned you way before the move.
There are a lot of good things to check before open a trade and making this check will only raise your % of win.
Thanks ❤️
This mans got it
Big Banks and institutions do not see your 1 lot orders or even ten lot orders they don't play the retail game. They need to fill their book at the best price they can possibly get by ""working"" the orders. They have large books that they need to fill so they will drive price around using an algorithm to fill their orders by stopping people out (your stops are counter party to their orders). It's by design. 

In terms of scale, think of it like being in an ocean as phytoplankton swimming in a sea full of fish sharks and whales that create currents and turbulence as they move around and try to eat each other. Our collective mass is less than 10% of the total mass, we are insignificant consistent losers. Our objective is to try and coast off the turbulence created any which way it may flow while not being eaten. 

How do you not get eaten? Stay solvent. Keep your risk small and learn from your mistakes. Risk maximum 2% of total equity on your best setups and don't use mental stops (you will go mental with them), use real stops. Jot down your trades (wins losses and misses) and the thought process behind it, review your trades weekly. 

Find a mentor that actually knows how to make money, not guys who flash wealth. Lastly, experience is the only way. Watch the markets and gain the experience. There is no other way to make money.
Yes of course, the more information you consider the better your chances. I also advocate for a systematic approach, and always look at volume, volatility, etc as part of your TA
One thing I've always had a difficult time is how to use volume as for forex movements
Happens suddenly, too.
Great analogy. Thanks for your input brother
Someone's watching ICT 😁
nice one bro !
That’s exactly what TA is! I’m learning way more with volume and it’s pretty clear that if you combine it with MA, Trendlines and other usefull indicators the win rate goes pretty up. It’s all about learning and knowledge. I like to see trading as making a pizza. More things you put more you know it will be good
I like the reference but I would say that for both,the more things that you combine,you realize that simplicity just works best!
Just like a pizza when you add to many things you can’t simply eat it (yeah I’m Italian lol). However I totally agree with you the message I would like that people will understand is to use the tool of TA for confirm their analysis and maybe to stop trading just 1 single pair
Unfortunately that’s not effective. Proper TA is effective."
Former investment bank FX trader: some thoughts,1430,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/ia5f37/former_investment_bank_fx_trader_some_thoughts/,"This is worth to be posted on Medium or other platforms so the upvotes means more than just internet karma. Love this!
Your write up is brilliant.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and I find it making more sense to me then most of the articles and ""gurus"" I've come across...

I was hesitant to trade due to my lack of knowledge on the stop loss and risk management but I can honestly say  your write up has given me clarity...

Thank you!
Great post. Thank you!
Good post overall.

Cant disagree more with the idea of splitting the amounts you risk depending on your 'conviction' on any given trade though. The market doesnt give a rats about that.

If you have a particular setup you are willing to risk a ridiculous amount on (ie 5%), then you should only be trading that setup and not the others.

If an ideology I see floating around the subreddit way too much and it just boils down to traders thinking they know wtf the market is upto. You dont, dont pretend you do, risk your 1% or lower and take the best entries you can. Not 3 different ones where you risk different amounts per entry.

Our job here is to control risk. I dont see why someone would open themselves upto potentially winning 3 x 1% trades and losing 1 x 5% trade to wipe out all their gains because they have more 'conviction' on 1 relative to the other 3. I mean you can argue that and say that you lose 3 x 1% and win the 1 x 5%, but again... our job is to manage risk, not hope for wins.

The concept, and why its popular, boggles the mind tbh.
Good stuff brother. Hope you stick around; this forum could use some more real professionals.
Awesome write up. Definitely looking forward for the next pieces. Thanks!
Good info about risk management, but the problem for retail traders is getting good trades to begin with. Most strategies will lose money regardless. Which makes me wonder, at the bank were you trading completely ""isolated"" or were you given briefings on which directions to trade certain currencies, or that sort of thing?
Fuck ey, someone who actually knows their shit. I am not a huge fan of Kelly (for same reason you divide by 4) but even getting new manually trading dipshits who are likely to hand all their money over to the market to use any reasonable money management system is a good one.

He hasn't plugged it but this is obviously his site: https://getmrmarket.com/

No 'buy my education/system' bullshit, so props for that- but yeah, also like all trading 'gurus' there is no evidence of success.
Question on position sizing, wouldn't the stop lose dictate it more than the % of the position size itself?

In your ex, given capital 100k and max of 2% risk per trade ($2k)

I could trade:

10% position size  (10k), and set stop-loss at 20%,

20% position size (20k), stop-loss 10%

For 4% position size ($4k), I could have stop loss as big as 50% (still risking just 2k per trade)

Then i can have flexibility to have 10 trades of 10k each (if I set stop loss at 5-6% instead of max 20% then I would even have more safety of margin), or maybe 5 trades of 20k each.

Edit..
Scenario above is for equity market, where loses won't make your stocks go 0 (I guess  99% of the time).
Great. More
Hey is this applicable in the crypto market?

Thanks anyways you re doing something really cool

Can you please write a book, this is perfect
Great post man. Whats your view on deciding on a  stop loss price (without putting it)where you manually stop the trade  if a candlestick actually closes at that price or worse? So you avoid wicks messing with your trade, if that makes sense.
What’s your opinion on fundamental vs technical analysis or a combination of both? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
Genuinely curious here- you're telling me institutional traders trade the same strategies as retail traders? Right- because in the first portion you said it was very different from home traders... Emas, support and resistance? Or are you just using that as examples to relate to retail traders? 

One thing that is very important is previous monthly highs and lows for sure- people overlook this too often.

Curious what your sharpe and sortino ratios are if you don't mind sharing.
As a retail trader, if you have the option to set your leverage with the broker at 1:20, 1:50 or 1:100, would you set it at 1:100 but still buy/sell units such that your risk per trade is no more than 2%? If you would set it to 1:100, why? Why not use 1:20 and still risk 1 or 2% per trade?

With my broker I have the option to set my leverage at 1:100 but I have set mine to 1:20 and generally risk no more than 1% per trade using position sizing based on where my stop loss is placed.

>  In general most traders should trade smaller position sizes and less frequently than they do. 

First of all, thank you for these very helpful and concise posts!  


I am currently looking at the maximum 2 positions a day.  


Do you count this as too much?
I had been super busy and just got around to reading this post. In all my time as an amateur trader experimenting with position sizing and strategies I must say this is a fine piece of work you have put forth. I personally took a break from trading to focus on studying some math/financial instruments more in depth, I wanted to ask you if you had any resources that have helped you along the way better understand techniques of trading strategies?
Thanks so much for this. I have never dabbled in Forex at all but a lot of people ask me about it since we have a very scammy Forex TrAdEr community here in South Africa.

Feel a lot more comfortable in explaining this in a nutshell to my friends and will point them to your post 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
I am a fly trader and premium seller in equities and vix but I still found this useful.

Thank you.
Thank you. This makes a lot of sense and is easy to understand without feeling like you're trying to sell me something
I’ve been looking for clear and concise info that isn’t full of jargon that makes me feel dumb or intimidated! Thank you!!
The banks are not out necessarily to get you, per se, even though it may seem that way.
They are much better equipped to handle the risks and challenges of this industry.
None of the above is to be construed as investment or trading advice. I know absolutely nothing.
Be prosperous.
Thank for taking the time to post this.
Great thanks!
Great post, waiting on the next ones. Cheers.
Very thorough.
Great post - followed you, looking forward to more!
Great stuff. Keep it coming bud!
Good read. Waiting for next article
Thank you for sharing your knowledge, kind sir! Looking forward to your next posts.
It is very kind of you to help. To those who are new to trading, this is gold. Looking forward to the next article
Hey mate, this is incredible. can't wait to see the next chapter. 

I agree with all what you said above.

For more specific about risk management, I have always been risking 1-2% per trade and the way I manage my risk is with using the consistent lot size as I feel that grows my capital more consistently combined with good r:r. Obviously it took time to be disciplined and emotionalless.

May I ask you if you don't mind, why did you quit from investment banking ? do you trade by yourself now ?
I rarely comment since im just a lurker generally. Thanks for this post. Pretty awesome for you to share your expertise.
Thanks for the post. I'm hoping that you will talk about how to curtail overtrading/FOMO as well as Taking profits.
Thank you for your great post. I would like to know if you will cover Fundamentals (Cental banks monetary policy), seasonality, geopolitical events, election season etc. I think those things should also be taken in account right? 
Btw I started to work for a broker as a salesman, at least for a month to get some experience but later on I want to to trade. Still trading my own money.
Had to save this one, thanks

Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge, I'm geniunely excited for your future posts ! How did you go about fundamental analysis - what sources did you use and also which economic factors have the most impact on the fx market ?
Thanl you very much, OP, will read all your upcoming posts. Valuable knowledge and very well explained.

Thought of writing a book?
And every now and then we get a worthy post to read.  Very good material. Thanks for sharing.
Great stuff! I can’t wait to read the follow ups!
This was a great read. To follow up on that GBPUSD example, do you use any specific methods for optimizing the size of a stop loss? For example, visually determining a distance between entry and exit at loss. What about the use of an ATR? Any special ""numbers"" there?

I’m just getting into Forex and this has helped.

Two questions:
1. Do retail forex traders use automated trading systems to buy/sell, similar to the stock market?

2. Does automation exist for ‘stop hunting’ arbitration?
Looking forward to parts 2 & 3.
Holy shit bro thank you for taking the time to do this
Thank you for taking time to post this. This has been very helpful for a new trader like myself, and im sure it'll help all of us on this subreddit to become smarter traders.
This is an excellent post and write up, managed to cram a lot in a clear and concise way, thank you.
This is really an interesting summary about risk, looking forward for part II.

Looking forward for a book on forex trading by you. 4-5 years?
Fantastic post. Thank you.
What a hell of a post, Jesus man! I enjoyed every bit of it, congratulations and thanks for the clear way you explain everything :)
This was awesome! Thank you so much for teaching us risk management.
Seriously this is better than most of the crappy YouTube traders out there. You should try to get this in another format other than text. If you get it on YT you may even get add revenue.
This post deserves so much more upvoting. 

Thank you very much for taking the time and effort to write a beautifully educational post!
Great Post sir. You should consider making a ebook. It'll do well I think
Loved this one sir

Part one very helpful! looking forward to part II and part III
This will help me A LOT. I'm about to open my first trading account a few weeks from now.. and I'd like to try my luck on whether or not some of you guys would lend me some type of learning material for FX trading. Really eager to learn. Just don't know where to start lol.
ICT (Michael J Huddleston) claims that there are ""institutional levels"" which are .00 .80 .50 .20 and the reason for that is that large fund traders are having a lot of orders there. Can you comment if you've seen this happening from your perspective?
Appreciate the response thank you
You have no idea how useful this is to someone just starting out
Thanks for this series. Amazing work!

> where it lands on heads 60% of the time and tails 40% of the time.

Efficient Market Hypothesis says no. Your backtests may give you a number, but it's not real.

> Say you bet $50, the odds that it could land on tails twice in a row are 16%.

Gamblers Fallacy.

When Kelly Criterion fails does that mean you switch to Martingale? 

Betting strategies are not true risk management. That was done by the quants who took you as traders into baskets and managed your risk through diversification. They found beta by using your uncorrelated differences.

> Theorem 1: If a gambler risks a finite capital over many plays in a game with constant single-trial probability of winning, losing, and tying, then any and all betting systems lead ultimately to the same value of mathematical expectation of gain per unit amount wagered.[1]

Great post! thanks for sharing your knowledge.

got a quick question: do you still trade forex now after leaving your former job at the bank? is it like a full-time thing or part-time? thanks
This seems like some actual work 🙄 why not just buy Tesla calls ???
this thread reads like a cocksucker convention.
I do not understand the expressions „pips“ and the use of (50:1)“leverage“

Thank you for reading and the comment.  


Whilst I do LOVE your general theme that retail traders should control risk and take smaller bets, i must disagree on this particular point.  


Mainly, because the risk-adjusted success of many bets *is* quantifiable through thorough backtesting. If I come across a strategy with a high Sharpe ratio I should certainly allocate more to it than one with a lower one. This is a very well established fact in portfolio management.   


Even non quantitative strategies work along these lines. Let's say the fundamentals look attractive on a particular trade - call it long AUDUSD -  and the tech level now permits an entry with good risk:reward. You have positive expectancy on the trade so you are gonna do it. Now imagine the exact same scenario but this time the market positioning is at all time extreme short AUD and related markets (Aussie rates/bonds, copper etc.) *already* moved whilst AUDUSD didn't.   


Discretionary traders will  have higher conviction in the latter scenario (there is more information) but will still bet on the former if they still expect it to produce a positive result on average, hence the variation in capital committed between the two trades.  


Hope that helps clarify the logic? Open to your thoughts. Cheers.
> The market doesnt give a rats about that.

On certain cases, it gives more or less rats. This is why you upscale to just 5% instead of... 100%. There are situations when stars align and there are situations when you have a hunch and the duty/mood/etc to trade.

If the market wasn't predictable even by a tiny little edge, trading - ALL trading - would not exist just as a tic tac toe market doesn't exist, because there is no edge in there.

Thank you for reading and commenting :)
Thank you for reading and commenting :)

In a later topic i'll go through trade selection - there are lots of different approaches. Retail traders focus on tech analysis but there's also a) fundamentals ; b) factors (carry, momentum etc.)  ; c) intermarket relationships etc. I'll do a topic on each.

In a bank you can choose what to trade but in reality you are influenced by a) your trading colleagues' views; b) the activity of your clients (hedge funds etc.); c) insight from your research team. There is a morning briefing in which everyone shares their views and updates come throughout the day via something called a ""squawk"" - like a walkie talkie that folks can broadcast over.
Thanks for the kind words.

Yeah I am inherently skeptical of anyone claiming to be a ""guru"" (I certainly wouldn't use that word) because invariably they want to sell you something (as you noted, I don't). 

All I would claim I was professionally trained at a top IB and thus accumulated knowledge and experience which means I can offer insight into how professional discretionary traders conduct themselves. 

 I'm actually at pains to explain there's no magic formula that anyone can teach which works out of the box : even if you could study under a hedge fund legend with twenty years of audited returns  there's really no guarantee you could just rinse-repeat. 

I strongly believe you can learn the basics and avoid mistakes tho. Imagine being a writer and studying under a famous author - you won't necessarily end up one yourself.  However you will be likely to improve if you follow some well established techniques that professional writers have used consistently and avoid making newbie mistakes like overloading on adjectives etc.

Since I offer all my content for free no strings attached (per this Reddit etc.) I hope you'll agree it's a pretty fair trade.  Even free stuff can be valueless tho - it is all about it's quality - so I really appreciate that you and others on here found it decent.
Yes that's exactly right. The wider (more distant) your stops the smaller your notional position will have to be. The two things combine.   


However, the market doesn't care about how much capital you have so that should not be a factor.  


Instead, find a reasonable SL level - using techniques in this and part II post. Then go back from that to work out your notional position size by entering the SL pips , your account balance and your desired % risk per trade.  


I personally am more of a fan of longer horizon trades so naturally the longer the horizon, the bigger the stop distance, the smaller the position.

Thank you - will add more!
Thanks for reading! Since this request came a few times already in replies I'll speak with the mods about what's allowed - I want to be helpful and share content for free but I also wish to respect the rules. I see there's an FX Gears book thread - maybe if they feel it's up to scratch that's an option. For now please just keep an eye on here as i will write more.
Thank you. Yes, it is quite common to reference closing prices (rather than absolute high/low during the period) to avoid some noise. The difficulty with doing so on a stop (rather than trade entry, where i see it more) is what on earth do you in a SNB CHF depeg situation? The market drops way through your level and keeps falling ... surely you cannot wait for close of the day to trigger an order and get flat. Therefore without some complicated 'if this, then that' logic I think it'd be hard to achieve certainty of how much risk you're taking.
I'll cover this in a later chapter but typically for discretionary trading you'd use fundamental analysis to get a long-term bias (view up or down) ... then tech analysis helps you time the entry/exit levels ... you wait for conditions to be attractive. You can combine other pieces of information (position, related market price action etc.) to help bolster or weaken your view. I'll cover it all in a separate note.
I will cover tech analysis in a later chapter. Institutional traders do use it although more for picking entry /exit levels than trade generation. A decent Sharpe would be >1.
The crucial thing is definitely controlling the risk per trade. The leverage offered is way too high in my view and leads to people trading larger amounts than they should. If you have $5k to risk and stick with 2% per trade you should only be risking $100 per trade. Let's assume you run something like five trades at a time and have a stop loss of 100 pips. You only need to trade a 10,000 EURUSD clip per trade. So 1:20 leverage is absolutely fine and you don't need more.
Thank you for taking time to read and comment . Fully agree - risk management should be the core area of any training
Thank you. 

Very interesting questions. 

I think the ""Robinhood effect"" of retail trading is more observable in stocks - consider Hertz, for example . However look at what happened in oil when it went negative as well. In FX I think it's less clear: the retail volumes that get hedged are a tiny fraction of the overall. It's probably most pronounced in JPY. 

Yes, I'd be happy to do a post on that. I agree there's a lot of misinformation on this topic.
Hiya. I'm not a huge fan of monolithic rules like ""no more than X per Y"" because these values must naturally adjust for - at a minimum:
-execution costs
-opportunities available
-volatility
-your level of alpha
etc.

Qualitatively what you should aim to avoid doing is wasting money on throwaway low conviction trades because you are bored and want to have some excitement. Sitting there all day and not doing a trade - do you feel you need to trade so that you have got something out of the day's work? Well, if no attractive trades present themselves then it is better not to ... but most of us aren't wired that way :) 

Quantitatively, look at the cost of getting in/out of the trade. Basically that is: the whole spread (half on the way in; half on the way out). Say 0.8 pips in EURUSD. Now compare that to your TP level. If you are trading a one-hour chart and the typical move in one hour is, say, 10 pips then you are almost 10% down (0.8 pip of 10) before you even start due to transaction costs. If you extend and trade a weekly view, the entry/exist costs are far smaller as a proportion of the range.

Yeah i'm less bothered about making money tbh. Maybe I'll do a video version at some point but it seems like a fair amount of effort. I like writing and i know nothing about video production/editing.

There's a good wiki in this subreddit, i guess check that out to start with.
As in, people leave orders at round levels? Yes that seems true of both retail and institutional though I never looked at the data. I think round figures .00 are def a thing, less so the others. USDCHF thru 1.00 was a good example of this.
I'm really happy it's helpful
Thanks
A few things.

You cannot manage risk with having SL orders unless you never sleep. So I don't see any alternative. As you said - what if something big happens? You might find out five hours later and have to cover at a much worse level than if you'd left an automated stop.

I think this idea of a whale hunting a retail stop is pretty much nonsense. Say you trade EURUSD and you have a position of 1 million (I understand even that would be quite big for most retail). 1 million  is just ... nothing. EURUSD trades more than 500 billion most days with a range of approx 50 pips. Your order of 1m is hardly going to move the market! It is like a lion hunting a fruit fly - he won't bother because it isn't going to be worthwhile :) 

The area where I would be concerned is sketchy brokers. It is plausible that a bad actor might do something like blip the market data, which triggers your stop. Note that any broker could never actually move the real market (they don't have enough volume/firepower to make EURUSD go up or down market-wide) so only their market data will move and you should be able to spot this by doing a comparison. The solution here seems simple to me: stick to highly regulated brokers (ideally public companies) in major jurisdictions and you needn't worry.

Well, most of the liquid pairs like GBPUSD are most liquid (i.e. cheapest to trade) and move most during the London-NY crossover for obvious reasons - most participants are in then. ""Fiber"" i don't recognise? It is true that EM pairs are more idiosyncratic and have fewer people focusing on them so if you have some particular edge in understanding a given country's economy i can imagine that's true ... on the other hand the spreads are far, far wider and liquidity is much worse so they're harder to trade from that perspective. I expect most people are better off sticking to the most liquid pairs.
With respect I think you've misunderstood a few things. 

EMH does not literally mean that markets instantly absorb all known information - or rather , taken in such a string form no one at all thinks the theory is remotely  accurate. https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/The-Great-Divide is a good primer. There are many obvious examples : Why does momentum continue to work? How can retail traders pump up the price of entirely the wrong zoom stock? How does RenTech exist? EMH is a wonderful observation that talks to the ""pricing in"" effect I wrote about in a later post but clearly it doesn't mean that markets are perfectly efficient and all actors in them are perfectly rational. I don't even think it's most ardent proponents would claim that now. Check out the AQR note for a great round-up. 

I don't follow your second point. You just inserted a random non sequitur. It has nothing to do with Kelly? Gamblers fallacy or Martingale are the exact opposite approach of Kelly which prevents you from overbetting. Kelly was not just some random betting guy: he was a first-rate mathematician and in the same circle as Ed Thorpe who also combined maths/fixed odds games/finance and is widely thought of as the founder of the first quant hedge fund. Many of the largest fund managers are on record saying they use Kelly today. Math doesn't age badly.

No really man! I want to get your details and everything! 😂 
I'm a IT grad that just got work and have A LOT of bills to pay. So i have to get the knowledge first, and demo trade. Untill i know i am ready, and know I can afford to lose the money i trade with. But yea, would love to learn more!
I totally understand where you coming from and I do agree to a certain extent...

Here's the other side of the coin, people that pay for things tend to be more committed to seeing it out till the end compared to people that find it free online...

I suppose it's the type of person consuming the information.

Double edged sword.

I look forward to reading your other posts.
Hi, thanks for the response.

Cant agree more about the importance of backtesting. But that was pretty much my point - if you have a strategy or system that has a higher expectancy than the other then why not just trade the high expectancy system only - if not only for peace of mind and assistance in controlling ones psychology.

If for eg you have a predetermined drawdown you are not looking to hit (lets say 25% over the 3 levels of trades you pointed out 1,3 & 5%), trading only the higher expectancy will pretty much assure you dont hit that max drawdown level while also maximising risk-adjusted returns.

I would assume that the less expectancy a setup has, the more often it occurs and this would be the same situation as your example uses (this has been an observation I have found to be true in all my testing). So lets assume that perhaps the 5% trades dont happen that often but I would be very cautious in taking them at that risk level anyway because I hate the idea that one loss on a 5% trade wipes out 5 1% gains or nearly 2 3% gains.

I am not saying the system of splitting risk levels doesnt work, it probably does but employing that kind of risk management scheme can pile a load of pressure on the psychology (Esp for newer traders) that really doesnt need to be there. 

This ofc is just my opinion.

Disclosure : I risk 0.25% a trade but each trade has an expectancy of 0.155 ((33%\*2.5)-(67%\*1)). I take about 5000-5500 trades a year so the edge plays out in the long run.  
I have taken a log a while back over 1000 trades and graded them by conviction and confidence - findings suggested that the end result for split risk was slightly lower, pretty much the same as flat risk BUT the psychological impact that came with 2 or 3 higher confidence trades losing in a row was damaging and really not worth it.  
I respect that doing a test on confidence is different to having a different setup with a different expectancy but conviction and confidence is more linked to gut feel than anything. 

All the above has pretty much led me to stick to a flat risk rate on a completely objective system rather than split risk on a discretionary system.
That was a great post btw! Good for beginners, and for more experienced traders as well learning about somethings that we may not have known about.

I have a question regarding the industry though; how is the market like career-wise for traders wanting to go into the more institutional side of things? I've heard of prop firms and such, but what I've been told is that they're actually exceedingly rare and the ones that do exist use mostly quant strategies. The ones that use discretionary strategies are even rarer. What do you think about the possibility of someone who's a retail discretionary trader breaking into the institutional side without having great academics like how it's so often required in these high-finance roles?
> Mainly, because the risk-adjusted success of many bets is quantifiable through thorough backtesting.

Risk-adjusted-reward yes. However the ""probability"" numbers are meaningless. If your backtest tells you 60% chance of success, just assume that actually means 50%.
Thanks for the response!

I'll make sure to check out future posts then, personally I lean more towards fundamentals rather than technical analysis (been there, done that) but haven't had an in-depth look at the others. Wondering if you've ever looked into/used order flow?

Interesting that you say that about the views of other traders/clients, I think u/parallaxfx (who runs/manages a fund) said that the most useful part from the Bloomberg terminal was the chat, as you can see what everyone else is doing. I've been using the COT report myself as a sort of retail look into what the big speculative traders are doing, though it's a bit delayed.

As a new trader seeking a career in currency do u have any tips tricks resources or process suggestions to help breakthrough into the industry?
Thank you for your answer.
What about institutional type of trades, also known as order blocks where there are engulfing candles and the sentiment is that retail traders are not able to move markets like that. After engulfing candles price tends to come back for a retest and continue with an intended direction. Is this something that institutions, in your opinion, are specifically doing?

Is the retail ""liquidity hunt"" a thing? E.g. pushing a price where retail traders most likely would have their stop-losses.
>  the exact opposite approach of Kelly

Precisely.

With the same outcome.

> Theorem 1: If a gambler risks a finite capital over many plays in a game with constant single-trial probability of winning, losing, and tying, then any and all betting systems lead ultimately to the same value of mathematical expectation of gain per unit amount wagered.[1]

As much as you'd like to think your backtests contain probabilities, they are just *back*tests.
Lol, i'll be posting more on here and eventually create a summary thread for people. I am glad you enjoy it.
This guys been sold many online courses
Thanks - glad you like it. I will be honest I think it would be super hard. The routes i know are joining a graduate scheme at a bank or fund manager (competitive process) and then moving as an experienced hire. I am not very familiar with the ""prop"" shops.
Yes. I will cover the various things in later posts when i get the time. Most discretionary traders i know would use some form of fundamental analysis combined with intermarket relationships and then patiently wait and use tech analysis solely to pick entry/exit levels and timing.   


COT is great (and i'll be covering it in part III), although delayed as you correctly note. If you trade over long horizons that matters less. If you are on BBG and have a good network you get anecdotal evidence of what others are thinking/doing in real-time: I agree this is an advantage and the main use of the terminal alongside charting. It can also make things noisy and risks groupthink though so it is not without demerit.   


Banks also estimate positioning based on what they see each day. COT only covers those pairs with liquid CME futures (EUR, GBP, AUD etc.) whereas there are many interesting FX pairs that trade elsewhere (SEK, NOK, KRW etc.) and thus are not included in the report.
Working for someone else? The only route I know is applying as a graduate to a bank for a summer internship and then they fill full time grad class from those. It's similar with asset managers. If you mean trading for yourself , I guess education is the first thing and being self aware so you can take an approach that fits your personality and protects against your psychological  biases (we all have them).
I agree - retail flows are too small (individually) to move markets and it can certainly be the case that a huge institutional portfolio switch can (temporarily) move a market. In such cases (assume a buy) you'd probably see the market move up with the order ... then mean-revert as it pauses or finishes ... then up again as the order resumes and/or other investors add similar positions because investment models can be quite similar. 

I don't think institutional investors are trying to hunt retail stops, nope.
What you have said makes no sense, I'm afraid. You keep quoting Wikipedia articles but do not think about what the words mean or when such an observation would or wouldn't apply. What is the single-trial probability of FX trading in your view? Is it the same for all participants? Is it the same for all strategies used by these participants? Do the same strategies vary over long periods of time? Etc. 

However, I don't think it is for me to argue the case for Kelly : there is plenty of both academic and practitioner  literature on it and you are welcome to ignore it should you wish to do so. 🙂 It's not really worth continued discussion - there's plenty of evidence out there and if it doesn't convince you then I'm not going to! 

Saying backtests are backtests is true in a trivial way of course : one can use all sorts of techniques to avoid overfitting but of course you are only working with past data. Making the logical leap that these past data contain no clues as to future data (ie thinking that they cannot inform probabilities at all) is a very non consensus concept. The entire  statistical arbitrage industry would surely disagree! Your logic would again fail to explain the momentum factor.  Again though if this is what you think I see little to gain by discussing it further. You are entirely free to hold a novel view but you should be aware it is totally at odds with industry norms and academic literature.
I'm your biggest fan now. I've been looking for something like this for a long time.
Thanks man, glad to know. It seems like all the time I've spent trading can't really be utilised in building my corporate career :\\
[removed]
That all sounds pretty similar to what I'm doing then; entries using charts, in the direction of COT and/or economic data. And yeah, COT seems to swap over over several months so I'm not too worried about a weeks delay, especially as I'm still only going to enter once I see a good price.

Thanks again for the responses, lots of stuff to look into :)
Thank you, this is incredibly helpful!

What are the most simple strategies that you’ve seen institutions are using and that retail traders are not? Are there any?
>  What is the single-trial probability of FX trading in your view?

The choice of up/down.

Your counter example was momentum, which is more about price-action than TA.

>  Is it the same for all strategies used by these participants?

Over time, yes. I'm sure you know from experience that nothing works for very long.

> plenty of evidence out there 

Sure, if you start from the premise that you can predict probabilities of up/down direction in a random time-series.

Kelly works. If you have a probability to go with.

> The entire statistical arbitrage industry would surely disagree!

That's where they take your decisions and then hedge them with the decisions of other traders. This is how your boss made risk-adjusted-reward from your decisions.

They don't need to rely on predictions of direction but find beta in uncorrelated actions.

I see little to gain by discussing it further. Ask your boss about how it works.
Thanks - glad you like it
> COT report

seems to be ""commitment of traders"" reports from what i found searching      

not sure what BBG is though
Timezone based - for example go plot (over last ten years) performance of gold in London hours period and outside that period
Bloomberg (terminal).
BBG is bloomberg terminal.

It's what everyone (almost) uses to get information at institutions on both the buy (funds) and the sell(brokers/investment banks).

I am on the buy side my entire career and use one to chart get info run analysis price options and then execute with chat. And also get research through chat in chat rooms.

Thanks u/getmrmarket for jogging my memory I've been trading appallingly on my pa account recently, I look forward to more. I'm in research now so allowed a pa account at the moment.
Other than the benefits of reduced spread and higher liquidity during certain trading sessions, could you please explain the advantages behind trading a specific timezone? Thanks
Exactly right - Bloomberg terminal, sorry for the shorthand. COT is a positioning report, I'll cover that in detail in part III.
There appears to be bias in returns based on timezone https://www.snb.ch/n/mmr/reference/working_paper_2011_04/source/working_paper_2011_04.en.pdf
I appreciate you sharing this research paper.I have spent the last half an hour reading it and drawing my own conclusion in an attempt at forming a bias to compliment my own strategies. I believe this sort of knowledge could be hugely beneficial, and I can understand why institutions may utilize research like this and therefore why they may have an advantage over retail traders.Thanks again.

🤷🏾‍♂️
Yes candlestick patterns alone aren’t going to get you far, in combination with indicators and order flow they can go a long way. 90% of traders are never profitable anyways, regardless or chart type or amount of indicators. It’s all about increasing the probability of a trade and candlesticks most certainly can assist with that. Charts today and from 50 years ago look the same and yes patterns do assist in trading.
I highly disagree from experience. 

Any real successful trader don’t go around providing their opinions like that to others, at-least not in the way you presented it, telling someone to go to a YouTube video rather than articulating it yourself. lmaoo. 

You say you also don’t know anyone who trades using price action alone, may I ask who are these ppl you know? What’s their success rate, win-loss ratio? 

I trade price action alone with minimal indicators and use wicks and pin-bars for my stops, I can definitely well say I’ve been doing really well. 

Just because all you see are white swans 🦢 don’t mean black swans don’t exist. 

Confront your assumptions.
I said that once and I’ll say that again: NNFX, together with ICT, are responsible for brainwashing and ruining an entire generation of traders. The success rate of NNFX traders is equivalent to the one of any other trading style, which you can clearly see by reading their Discord.
Lol huh
Predictable, consistent trading opportunities is what you look for in the market.  So yes, you want to find predictable trading opportunities
..... you as a trader need to be unpredictable...... but the stock itself needs to be predictable otherwise your just guessing or Manipulating....... either way your two cents is not even worth the cheapest penny stock on ANY public forum..... (FYI my opinion is worth even less but I felt the urge to post useless info and be argumentative like u) 👍
My point was only that the meme is about plain candles, which are just a neutral visual representation of OHLC price values. There is no link between candle usage and (un-)profitability.
Candlestick *patterns* are a totally different beast only you came up with.

And I don't understand your last point about predictability at all. Are you really caring about whether YOUR actions are predictable? Why? Nobody cares about what you do in the markets.

My job is to predict (yes, of course, *predict!*) the actions of those who move the market.
Candlestick patterns and indicators LOL!
If I sat here and “articulated” myself in that post, I would be here all day typing out suggestions. I simply don’t have time for that.. he is a complete beginner. A YouTube video is much better in every way. Majority of people are visual learners and a video would be of much better service then typing out paragraph after paragraph. I wouldn’t know their statistics because I don’t ask for them but I can definitely say with confidence that they’re not profitable annually. 

I would ask to see evidence to support your claims of being profitable but every time I ask for this, no user provides and argues instead. I provide proof multiple times over and over again of an algorithm being more profitable then price action long term and I will stand by that. I’m not arguing that you’re not a profitable trader using price action but you could be MORE profitable using an algorithm with multiple indicators. It takes me 15-20mins to make my trades everyday.. I’m sure you’re sitting in front of your computer screen for hours on end waiting for a setup or waiting for an alert to go off. I don’t have to do that.

I bet you also think the banks don’t move price?
I disagree with this. I used to trade the way everyone else trades until I switched and found this works a lot better. You simply have not put in any effort or time or you would’ve found it to be more useful as well.
What do you use instead?
Looking back at you post history you use both candlestick patterns and indicators. So you must be one of the ones who’s not profitable long term?
Lol you know he’s a beginner, yet want him to start off by creating ‘algorithms’. 

Also, I don’t need to sit in front of my screen all day, I swing-trade and cross correlation and commodity currencies provide more opportunities that most might think. 

Lastly, it’s bold of you to assume everyone here is trying to get rich or make FX trading as their full-time job. 

I take my profits from FX and re-invest them in high growth equities and value investments, and other misc. investments not relative to the market better ROI for me personally in the long-run that compounding back into FX. Again, my own personal preference. 

Everyone is different, and it takes a certain amount of passion, quantitative knowledge, expertise to get into algo, but then again to each their own, for all you know you’re providing advice on trading using algo to some 17yr kid that got their parents to open up a brokerage account for them, not saying it’s the case here, but I’ve seen it happen from some of the posts others have made on this sub.
Responding to you is worthless. I answered your questions and you have yet to answer mine and provide proof of profits.

Enjoy the rest of your day/night sir and good luck with everything.
I don’t gotta provide proof to some random guy on the internet I’ll never meet a day in my life, who are you to me? lmao, just know algo ain’t the only way to make profits so don’t bash others strategies just because you have a diff opinion. 

Goodnight lol.
I never bashed anything. You could have a below 50% W/L ratio and still come out profitable if your money management is right. Putting this guy on the right track as a new trader instead of trading on 15mins TF and using patterns is something every new trader does.

Also you don’t have to show any proof, as you stated. But I personally wouldn’t take advice from someone who is not profitable and avoids simple questions such as the bank one. This is not stocks, this is completely different.
Lol yeah but anyone can build good trading strategy through risk management, good psychology and patience. 

It’s worked before AI’s and algos were created early 1990’s - 2000’s. Ppl have been profitable even before indicators and back testing was ever a thing. 

Not everyone can build an a solid algo that can adapt consistently with the market, as it’s highly quantitative. 

Just saying, if you can’t even trade the traditional way and be somewhere successful, I highly doubt going straight into algos will do you any good.
I highly disagree with this statement. If I was a new trader and I purchased a bot to trade for me, I wouldn’t need any experience besides a tutorial on how to use the bot. I also disagree with anyone can build a strategy that easily as it takes time. It took me months to find good indicators because most of them are shit and I’m still in search for better ones. You need specific indicators that go well with your specific algorithm.
Lol you make it seem like making algorithms are easier than what they are though. 

But ppl in r/algorithms and r/algorithmictrading would argue otherwise.. even they still have a difficult time making consistent profits and many of them are Msc and math majors.

Of course those subs are relative to equities, but same concepts of difficulty.
Making the structure for an algorithm is easy, finding the correct tools is hard. I told you it took me months to find them and I’m still continuing to search so I’m unsure what you mean by me making it sound easy. Your major has nothing to do with it..
Like I said, I’m not disputing that algo doesn’t work, I’m just saying that from the basis of the original argument that trading using price action also works as well. 

I work as an equity research analyst but have friends that work in Sales and trading.. cash equities, FX, derivatives, commodities desk etc. you name it, they all scalp, day trade, swing, carry trade all on the side as a hobby, and although some do use algos, most don’t and are still pretty successful traders. 

Again not disagreeing with you, but just remember that your advice is based on the merit OP will actually know how to build a good algo. 

To each their own. Just because it works for some doesn’t mean it will work for others and vice-versa. For me, I’ve tried it and it just wasn’t my niche, I prefer the good old traditional method, it’s a hobby because I like trading, applying algos takes away from the manual aspect and that defeats the purpose for me. 

Just remember that when providing advice to anyone in general, that it’s never about what’s better and what isn’t, what works and what doesn’t.. but rather the success is based on the merit that this individual whom you don’t know can learn, understand and apply the method and many other factors that must be taken into consideration that is way beyond the scope of this current discussion.

I won’t be replying back cause I don’t have the time to consume on going back and forth just to prove a point to a stranger on the internet. 

Just remember again, to each their own and there are many ways to be successful in trading asides from building algos, which inherently, again, depends on that specific individual as well. 

Have yourself a good night and happy trading!
Well said sir.

Good luck and enjoy the rest of your night."

I have a 100% win rate with counter trend trades. 3/3 ain't much but still 100% win rate.
Very good !
if the professional one is doing this, we should have learnt something from them. This is a great lesson, isn't it?

trading counter trend is the way to go, stop listening to gurus who tell you trading reversal is bad and why u should just follow the trend, u buy the dip or you're late
Almost correct!! My account get sucked by pump and get stuck under water.. can’t even come up!!😩
Profit is profit!
I hate the feeling....:)

As a swimmer you tighten your stuff so it doesn’t come off. You normally encounter the most force on impact so it’s the technically the same force as a regular pool dive and swim

Never trade live until you have the basics down and you're making consistent profits on your demo acc.

No technique is 100% perfect and it takes multiple trial and errors before you can implement a technique 100%.

Counter trend is fine but from what I've read and seen in forex the large institutions trade ranges mostly using mean reversion and heavy confluence zones to find trades as they only need to secure 50 pips to make what I do in a year lol
Trade without discretion. Know your SL, don't set a TP. When price impulses you should be looking for the counter trend.. don't confuse counter trend with ascending or descending channels... those are signs of reversals. Strong impulse candle but a long wick- price  will most likely range for a good while. I trade only the 1h.
there is no such thing as a ""sideways trend"".
You are correct. 50 pips is my target and its actually quite simple with a few specific pairs. Sometimes the entry is actually right at the beginning of the trend so I could actually hold for way more than 50 pips. But depending on lot size and leverage 50 pips is plenty. Especially at 1:200 leverage

Ask to see a portfolio and they instantly get defensive
I used to be involved in MLM couple years ago, now I’m trading alone full time ... looking back at that journey always makes me laugh at how I used to actually try to recruit people.

The only thing it was good for was it introduced me to the concept of day trading, once I understood the potential behind it, I just fell in love... and it always makes me sad to this day seeing others try to recruit, knowing that they can be so much more if they just took the time to at least try to learn how to trade😞
I actually encountered my first MLM a week ago and went on a bit of a rabbit hole looking through the content. It’s stunning how they are able to recruit people, if I were desperate for cash had never heard of forex or came across baby pips I would be inclined to give this a shot. The thing is they aren’t teaching you shit on how to trade they videos only talk about “being a boss” and “taking control of your life” they do a great job of marketing to the disenfranchised I will give them that, but yeah the MLMs are trash.

I’m with Epic...there are some people out there that just want to recruit and never help ya. My small group we actually trade trade..I show my profits and my losses.. but yeah I don’t do the recruiting thing..I like trading... so far I have about a 65-71% win rate.
I joined astrofx online course and paid 2,000$ for it. What a fucking waste of money
Mlms have their place, but I believe it is nuts for them in the investment and trading world. That being said a forex mlm is what introduced my to forex and got me my first 10k+ per month income before I could do it on the charts alone. So, I am thankful for it and now happy not apart of them. Lol
Only 5% people or less make some good amount, I am guilty of being scammed by these guys , literally they glorify money and worship it they tell you to make insane goals, most crazy thing of all they say-"" everybody else wants you to fail so just dont listen to them"".
My advice if somebody tries to get you into one of these just run like crazy, you might as well get hit by a truck, but don't ever fall into this shit hole.
Boom. MLM in a nutshell.
[removed]
Yup this shit is a low key epidemic for the college age kids. My buddy goes to college in Florida and tried getting me into IM Academy which is a forex education/signals/“mentorship” platform. Every single person in my buddy’s group were out in 4 months or less. I took one look at it and saw it for what it was. He pressured me to join literally guaranteeing I wouldn’t loose money. Told me he’d pay me back if I ended up loosing. I got the account and issued my refund 3 days later (7 day return policy) because I could 100% tell this wasn’t gonna end well for him. He admit it was a mistake but never fessed up to loosing any money which I’m certain he did.
Pretty much all of them are getting scammed. 2 of my Friends have been scammed out of $1200 and $1500, but they don't wanna leave because they believe they can make that money back \[Spoiler: They can't\]
While they are getting conned out if their money. If they learn to be successful at roping people into the MLM then they learned a salesmanship skill. 

Not a bad skill to have when you're selling a actual good product. 

Not really defending mlms just playing devils advocate I guess.
Only 10 percent of people who join MLMs make money, and of that 10 percent, only 1 percent make good money. Anyone who makes money usually makes it off of other members instead of actual customers. 

Edit: The 1 percenters will make hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. They are often used as the example to get people fired up. The rest of the 10 percent will break even or make a few hundred bucks, honestly not even enough to make it worth their time. The other 90 percent lose money. 

I honestly don’t know why MLMs aren’t illegal yet.
For every 100 scams you find one decent trader with a good community behind them either solid fundamentals to make money I'm lazy I invest in a community that trades for me and I make passive income no recruiting bs.. when its real you don't want many to join lololl
Then they say that they’ll get you on a call with their mentor who will be able to answer all your questions. Spoiler: They do not answer your questions. (At least honestly)
Definition of when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. Good job getting out of it and making a career out of it.

Dude! They never say how much they make! the ppl I know are too embarrassed (or proud?? )to admit they’re getting played, some make money but honestly no idea if it’s more than a part time job. The thing that gets me is how they act so elitist about it. Also know some people who been at it for years, just blows my mind
It all depends on who your mentor is but yes there’s some hella cancerous groups/“mentors” out there
Dam this is crazy because I have had a great experience with IM Mastery Academy. Problem is alot of young kids have never been through obstacles and don't understand that this is the largest financial market in the world so it has to be taken seriously. There really is some amazing traders but to many fools out there I agree.

Low key I don't even tell people I'm apart of IM just because Of all the hate it gets, but I mean it can't be a scam lol I've worked construction for 12 years and have been trading full time for 13 months.

Honestly I'm at a point where I can quit now as im self sufficient but I have alot of friends in my town that I met and although some of them still be borderline sounding scammy when they talk lol overall MLM isn't bad its different and you may not believe in a product.

But what isn't a scam? My old $55 an hour union job has 6 figures of my retirement that I can't take out untill I'm 65 because they are trading it in these markets! lol WTF gimmie my shit so I can buy some bitcoin! In the end I've learned to be open minded about opportunities.

Easy way not to get scammed is if someone is presenting any opportunity to you. Ask them if you can meet at thier house. Trust me no one will ever scam you then cause you know where they live.
I found out about IM Academy off some guy on YouTube. I was pulled in by the idea of jt being like a college and you pay tuition. I wasn’t gonna recruit nobody but is IM academy really that useless to those wanting to be a successful trader? Is it basically what baby pips or something might cover or what? I want to get educated on how to be a successsful trader one way or another, whether it’s IM Academy or WSA cue banks’ academy. I am a total noob but I see the potential in the market and in myself for sure. I started with my demo account... lost nearly 10K slowly over the first 2 weeks and then finally something in my head clicked and I made it all back plus some within 1 week of good trades. Something similar has started to happen now with a live account that I had loaded $700 into, lost $150 in 2 weeks and then started to go back to price action trading and using MACD, RSI, high timeframes, trend lines, etc and now I’m only like $70 away from getting back to my initial 700 in a week.
Absolutey. Hell I learned a lot just sitting through MLM seminars. I’ve helped steer a few friends clear by attending with them and I’m always picking up on the different ways they are able to manipulate the conversation it’s honestly fascinating (and a bit infuriating) watching an expert MLM recruiter do their routine.
Oh yeah for sure there are a few good people out there. And you’re right that the recruiting stuff is the biggest red flag, apart from the tier systems they give to make people feel important (super Manager, tier 3 double black diamond manager etc) lol
I'll connect you to someone more comfortable with lying through their teeth.
This is how I stopped talking to my cousin sadly. He hit me up one day about an “opportunity” and we had a zoom call with his mentor trying to get me into IM.
I full time day trade now
Multilevel marketting. Aka a pyramid scheme that might not be illegal because they have a real product too. Often they want to sell you a 'membership' in addition to selling you the product, and the incentives are built as a pyramid scheme with prices disconnected from either production cost or fair market value.
The people at the top of the bigger MLMs make a shit ton of money.
Bro one girl I know tried to get me into her IML group and showed me that someone off her team “made” 10k, turns out that shit was on a demo account but of course me being new to trading I was blinded by that shit and joined, but thankfully she moved teams the week I joined so I got a refund and started researching the company and found out I dodged a pyramid scheme.

> Problem is alot of young kids have never been through obstacles and don't understand that this is the largest financial market in the world so it has to be taken seriously. 

Or they’ve got a different skill set. The biggest problem I have with MLMs is the inherent conflict of interest from those endorsing the company. So many MLMers put so much time and effort into marketing the lifestyle. Business fundamentals & pragmatism always seem to take the back seat. It’s no wonder so many fail in these heavily marketed industries.

Most people have no business touching MLMs with a 10 foot pole. Yet “unmotivated” people who “don’t put in the work” keep finding their way into these businesses! MLMing has existed for over 100 years. How does this keep happening? If the business model could exists without fools/weak people why on earth is it always attracting people who weren’t able to put in the work?

Call me a conspiracy nut, but I think these schemes are built to prey on these “young kids” you talk about. Look at the marketing. It’s always embellished. It’s always suggesting success. It’s usually targeting the newbie. You CANT have it both ways. If it wasn’t for the clueless kids who are being enticed by the prospect of retiring early and vacationing while they work, you wouldn’t have that revolving door of new money that pops in to pay for your bonus. - Yes, your consistency can pay off as you get more guys who are willing to stick it out with you and can afford that risk. But it’s not feasible for most people (even many of those who are brilliantly business minded).



I’ll cut it off here. Sorry for giving you an earful. That’s great you learned forex with IM Academy and saw success, but I despise MLMing as a business model. I don’t care how great the product is, MLMing in its current state does not help people in the way you may want to believe.
Thank goodness for your comment. I had replied to someone talking down on IM academy with: I found out about IM Academy off some guy on YouTube.

I agree. I'm in IM academy myself and so far i didn't make and plus because I'm still learning with a demo account. I want to start a ftmo Challenge. Anyway the education you get there is really good and you can trade live with profitable traders while they educate you. It also helped me get a better mindset and I met a lot new people around my country who i also met in real life.
Many people think these kind of academies are just plain scam but well..it's easy to assume that if you don't make your own experience. Almost everything is a scam these days. That's why actually legit academies or such get an instant bad reputation
Lol...yes bro they literally use demo account to show people that they are making money, which in fact they are not. They only push network marketing and not much the trading, I joined last May and exited two months later it was total crap to be honest.
No real meaningful trading knowledge or experience will ever come this easy. Complety disregard anything that promises to make you money, because no one is ever going to tell you with very rare exceptions like mentors or good teachers. It all has to be earned.
Teach yourself my man. Information is EVERYWHERE. I don’t trade forex (fuck that). But I started trading stocks with $500 shortly before the restaurant I used to work for went out of business. I ended up living completely off the market for 8 months. I only started working again because I got tired of having TOO MUCH free time on my hands and i was bored a lot. 

On top of paying all my living expenses, rent and bills with the market, I also bought a new motorcycle so I could give my old one to my little brother, payed my girls schooling off, and upgraded all of my music equipment. 
 
I work now to keep myself busy, but I still trade at least 3 days a week. Love it
Honestly I get what your saying and everything makes sense. Its just these markets have really opened my eyes up to how this world really works and also being mindful of my emotions. I trade smart money concepts and use no indicators just naked charts (no im better than anyone) so after watching so many candles print and price returning to the same exact spots.

In every freaking market, Metals, indices, commodities. Crypto currencies, stocks, ect. I realized everything is a scam lol. Thats tough for alot of people to swallow because now we are entering into conspiracy talk and thats when people start to discredit information. My point is literally the entire world is Scamming us so when I hear the word oh thats a SCAM I laugh because literally our whole life was a scam and we are arguing about MLM.

I appreciate you guys reading I enjoy having some conversations where you have to put your thinking caps on.
Put it like this IM Academy is like a Car Company for example FORD, no matter what, your going to have people that say FORD sucks because they had a bad experience with one once or their friends don't FORD so they follow the crowd.

Now each FORD dealership has different personal working there, you may have a bad hostess at one or bad mechanics at another.

Same with IM Academy, you have people that got scammed by a MLM company so no Matter what they will say its bad, also even if your in IM it doesn't guarantee that your team will be good or even enjoy trading.

I'm blessed that the person that invited me, actually lives by me and is an educator for the company so trading is a everyday thing with our team.

To be honest no Matter where you learn just be careful when people say its easy, or you can learn quickly, or they have a master strategy. At the end of the day no one here can predict the markets, so risk management, risk to reward and controlling your emotions are key.
Yeah I figured that out! I think just reading a bunch of the best books on trading and taking notes will be better than anything else for now. I would love a mentor, I really would.
I been fucking with crypto. I been trying to learn everything about every market. stocks, forex and crypto. I’m loving the shit out of crypto at the moment  it’s like the coolest of all the brothers who is banging all the bitches the other 2 want to bang 😂😏 but yeah. I would love to get into stocks once I make this bag.

Did FOREX for a few months. That shit is intense. Still not consistently profitable.
I appreciate this more than you will ever know…
Yeah it’s understandable that it worked out for you, it’s got to work for someone to be successful. But I’d wage on you just having a better knack for this, or to put it frankly you might just be smarter than some of these other people. 

What gets me is how they prey on the dreams of poor/ people less savvy to the market with predatory marketing through influencers etc. And then drip feed glimmers of hope to them that they will one day be successful.

Also you’re right in that everything is a scam in this world however, this effects a disproportionate amount of people who are desperate, young or in lower income groups.
What do you know about statical inference?
Damn, you’re lucky and thank you for such a easy to understand example. That’s what I’ve come to find out on my own as well, that there is no real holy grail to trading successfully and that you can’t 100% predict what the next move in the market will be so anyone saying they can do it, CAREFUL with them. In fact, it’s best to just outright ignore anyone making such claims like that, from what I’ve come to realize. There are indicators and trends to help be right more often but still does not guarantee you’ll be making a good trade decision. It’s like you said, risk management and such. Controlling emotions. Thanks for your comment again. I plan on most likely enrolling in a few different courses online over the span of my Trading career but only from those people or organizations who can prove they’re actually making money and with real proof to back it up. No demo accounts, no insane claims.
Be very careful, you are right at the stage where you know the terminology and strategies, but you can't understand the game yet. You are diving into a deep ocean with alot of sharks and if you don't learn to tell the difference between what's real and what's a scam, you will end up thoroughly fucked. This included books. Start asking yourself what the book wants from you(even if it's just the $19.99 you paid for it) and what you can learn from that.
I can’t get into crypto. I mean, I could if I wanted to. But there’s so many things from wallets to exchanges to this to that. Plus they are on a 24/7 market and they are wildly volatile. Respect though.

I daytrade stocks and options. I’m generally profitable. I actually lived completely off the stock market for 8 months without working just because I could. Only started working again because I was bored and my friend said he could get me a good job working with him in a field I already used to work in. 

Now I just do a few hours worth of work while him and I call trade plays to each other all day. It’s 25% work, 75% joking around, hanging out, and trading. Plus overtime lmao
Yea I have seen people with kids and struggling be sold this dream almost making it seem like it will for sure work for them without truly being transparent about the markets. I myself sold the dream in the beginning to my friends because I was excited and wanted my friends to join so we can practice all night together but most thought it was a scam.

Yes the only good thing about IM is they are not charging you thousands of dollars up front so literally If you were getting ""scammed"" your out $170 and you can cancel every month no questions asked so thats a plus.
Damn... Thank you."

Have a growth mindset. 
For example:
Thinking “This is too hard”. Replace with “this will take time and effort”.
Thinking “I’m not good at this”. Replace with “what am I missing?”.
Up 3%, down 5%, stagnant in the red, climbs back up and more to 10%, then a bad move brings me back to even. That's my experience so far after 2 months.

Took me 7 years and 5 accounts to be profitable, it is 30% skill 70% mental. Always use fun money and start small, don't dump 5 or 10 grand into an account just because you're doing well a few trades in. Bust a few accounts, get a feel for the market, learn some risk management, and maybe set a stop limit on your entire account, say invest $1000 but withdraw if you lose 30% so you can try again with 1k in the future with just adding another $300 so you can get use to losing money (because you're literally going up against a heap of people trained to take retail money).
yea i got bopped this week not even going to lie however i figured out why i over traded/over risked & as a result i took a 20 dollar loss overall, my strats, my analysis is correct, me marking up charts, putting up zones has gotten way better i've only been trading for 8 months so progress is progress i know the money will come with more time but small gains is the key for me
Yes. DEPRESSION
That is so true
even after 5 years of trading you think uou got it figured out
I'm continuously learning how to cope with depression while getting my lost money back without further hurting my pride and relinquishing my soul.

lol I said this so many times “learning a lot” 😂😭
I have never related to something so hard😭
Lot of thought stopping cliches in these comments
🤣😂🤣😂👍
Just keep consistently trading! And learn price actions,  it's the best! I found day trading the most difficult, learn how to lose small. Learn when to cut your loses. Also ready the art of currency trading! This changed my life! Wish someone told me sooner!
Wow, this really hurts 😅

thanks bro, i agree with you
Yeah that or the string could break
for a tiger to pounce, it needs to crouch first
Thanks for this!
To be honest, that sounds excellent for 2 months, considering most come, blow their account, and leave, great job :D
Bro don’t try to make back what you lost , just simply move forward with your new system and forgot the past. You setting a limit in your brain and once you reach it , you might go back again ... circle  is vicious.
Just get the lessons of the losses but don’t think that u have to get it back, that will lead u to revenge trading and you’ll loose more. Mental work is important, work in your planing, am doing a setup now with better plans, luckily I didn’t loose much and I actually made good money these last 3 months with LP and REITs. Am about to test a new setup with leveraged etf and crypto using tight stop losses and using the concept of the spring from Wycoff system
if you trade for the next 20 years, you can get rich... now you have the valuable experience and insights and nobody else has.
small gains will become bigger gains
over risking 
over trading is an issue for alot of people 
all u need is 1 or 2 trades per day if your in a losing trade close out early
This is what I've focussed on last week, not overtrading and over risking. Immediatly became profitable. Now just learning to trust my analysis as it's correct most of the time. The only problem though, I tend to become insecure when I see the price movement and out of panic I close the position, after the closing I se eprice miving the right way... So now I focus on my patience and everything becomes way better already. 

I found most of my problems are psychological. When changing my psycology one by one I will progress extremely quickly, just need to identify it, haha.
Honest question, you've found it significantly worth it?
It's a scam, look up Alwaysmarco on YouTube and see his videos on it. Don't sign up
Remember to diversify as well.
you can tell u have a positive mindset
Thanks dude. It has been a wild ride, that's for sure. The best thing I did to turn around initial declines was wait. I was so tempted to sell when it started going down and those are now my best performers. I have spent a ton of time researching companies too and averaged myself down on a couple.
Yeah someone told me starting out and breaking even constantly for over a year is actually pretty damn good lol.
I agree
LP is what?
Honestly yes I did, you not only get access to Golives with educators in the business that trade with you every day and makes money with you, and also you get access to a lot of different trading strategies so that you can try them and figure which one works best for you
I prefer having that mindset and try to find out why things happened and fix them than believing I can reach the sky with a broken plane.

It is being realistic. 

I'm all for being positive but your talk there can be detrimental.
Limited partnerships. Mostly oil companies LP. Such as SHLX and PSXP, etc..

Follow the price. Forget about news/fundamentals. Price will always go where it's supposed to whether manipulated or not. Price action is the best
What naive said, and I can't tell from experience, manage your risks, and it's better to exit a trade with a small loss then get a margin call.
Read what naive said over and over, write it down hundreds of times before you dive into the rabbithole. Most the shit you learn in the start us bullshit you dont need or that will ruin you

It works like every other instrument. You can hold as long as your account / drawdown allows you to
It depends if you are good or not. If you are good it will close when you want. When you are bad it will be closed for you ;-)
If you have the margin they will let you hold it till they have ALL your money.

Signal groups are usually what non legit forex groups use to market a company. I used to be in one of those
Would you happen to like numbers enough to do some backtesting for me? Free of charge of course :D
as for fees, it depends on your broker, you should check with them. Usually swap fees apply (positive if you’re going short and negative if you’re going long). 

Automatic close would only apply in case of a stop loss or a margin closeut (not having enough balance to maintain your position).

why
r/whoosh
Margin call
Lost 5k
I'm new to Forex. What I learned from Babypips is that candlesticks alone--any tool alone--is not a good indicator of where price might go. For example, you're watching the chart of a pair, and you're waiting for a point where you'll buy. You see that the market is trending down, and you think it will reverse at some point. A candlestick formation at what you think is the bottom of the trend appears, so you place a buy order. Instead of shooting back up like you think it will because of the candlesticks alone, it continues downward and you lose money. 

Something else babypips has taught me is that even if you use multiple tools to predict where price will go, all of them might be wrong haha.
I don't quite understand the point of this sub. Do you mind explaining it to me?
So pretty much it told you the obvious lol.. it can be wrong with a single indicator or with multiple. Learn how to find supply and demand zones and read price action. Fundamentals and everything else are just icing. Good luck boss

Crypto O Plomo
Exactly, Robinhood allows you to trade weekends, I like Coinbase but it takes a long time for your funds to be available but once you are ready you can trade 24/7 if yo want.
Came here to say this.
What do you mean? You can analyze all the trades you did, test new things, learn about new things, check the market for the next trading opportunities, improve your journal,... etc.
I tell myself do simulation with fxcm and tradingview. But you are right. Taking break is also very important part of trading!
We all do...but still its a great trading meme...just smile and stop worrying about pips...besides theyre just pips lol
Nope. It's just you. You're super special.
It's always anime time for me. Even when I'm trading I usually have an anime playing on one of my monitors. One of the many benefits of having multiple monitors.
Big facts, I’m on my 9th rewatch of code geass.
Facts i been rewatching the asterisk war
Lol
We all do bro!

Its just a really funny meme, lol a lil

By the way im up for the month
OP is talking about the financial markets. Not the ones where you buy fresh veggies. Thought I just clarify.
Thats what i love about crypto, the traditional markets need to get with the times.
Underrated comment 😆👍
Try Binance get a VPN if you’re in US
Yes, but when you close the laptop, there's nothing open to monitor.
damn man I use to pretend to be special
You should watch Made in Abyss. It's great.
Just finished watching death note. I’m going to give this a try
Speaking of fresh veggies... you’re 🌽 af. Enjoy luv.
😂😂 I second this since nobody else has
You only need a VPN if your trading the futures, you can still trade the spot markets from the US. I dont know about margin though.
I hate relaxing bruh shits wack everyone always tells me im no fun and to have fun but they are gunna be pissed when im crashing ferraris on purpose haha whos no fun now!!
A friend told me about it like 2 years ago, idk maaan
Yeah fs, let me know if you like it! I can recommend more like it. Also theres 2 nice ones for this season *god of highschool* and a demon king one
Out of the 436 anime I've finished watching Made in Abyss is one of my favorites. So I'd say it's well worth it and yes I've spent too much time on anime xD.
I most definitely will. 

Them fight scenes in god of high school are EPIC! I feel things are a bit rushed tho but what the heck. I still have high hopes for it.
Gonna be honest not really too hyped about the new anime this season but the returning anime shows have been really good.
What about 

\-Deca Dence  
\-Yahari ore no seishun love comedy wa machigatteiru season 3  
\-Enen no shouboutai: Ni No Shou  
\-Shokugeki no souma: Gou no sara  


Those are decent ones too. Personally I'm enjoying Deca-Dence the most so far.
Ayyyy i see you,Ill probably give it a try. Im relatively new tho into trading and im tryna find a strategy then back test it. I gotta lot to learn and i kinda put the learning off w anime its tuff
Season 2 this year right?
And its so true. Explained most the characters within 10 mims
And thats facts, i want some of my favorites to be renewed
Deca-Dence is great. 

The 2 different styles really do it for me.
There's a strategy in my post history that you can try.   
Also I get what you're saying but taking time for yourself and relaxing is vital to a good trading career because otherwise you'll just go nuts.

My best ideas usually come to me when I'm not doing anything trading related.
I have no clue to be honest but lets hope so!
I just peeped your profile and cant seem to find it, can you link me :3

Nothing in the markets is guaranteed.

**You're gambling**.  To some extent.

Same this shouldn't be downvoted at all!!
If you go into a casino you're gambling, in the short run you might make money but you will lose money.

But how can the CASINO guarantee profits in a game of chance? 

Because of their business plan allows them to guarantee profit even though all their games are ""gambling"".

Learn to think like he CASINO and not the player in the casino and you can guarantee profits.

Well good on you for investing in education! You’ll pay for it either to the market or somebody who created the course. All they do is expedite the learning process.

This is honestly amazing.  It’s so simple.
Gonna save this as a reminder. Thanks.

Noob here. Can someone explain why news, results, and trends are bad?
Investing 101. Focus on your locus of control.
Also can’t control emotions, but you can control if it effects your trading.
The trading dichotomy of control
And this is why I analyze and trade technicals. To me, news all but exists. News just makes me overthink or understand something a different way even though I would have been right or even make me lose more than I would have. Actually, this is such a fantastic way to approach trading. (OP’s image, not my personal bias for technicals)
add dumb people on the internet to the list of the thing you cannot control
No one ever said you can control the news and the next marlet move? This post is fucking ridiculous😂
Lies, just max out and hope for the best wallstreetbets style.
You can also control your praying
[removed]
Finally a post with some good common sense
I would add move your stop loss up as the trade moves into profit. No point in being 60% in profit and then giving it all back.
I disagree with post-execution. I live or die by my trailing stop, I use no targets, and I have a mechanical way of following a trend. Meddling with an open trade based on your discretion is suicide and I agree.
What trade journal do you use? Excel spreadsheet? I’m looking for something a bit more
exactly right!
The news is good tbh, the banks use the news as an excuse to manipulate the market. As long as you can predict how the banks move you can profit with them
They are not bad, they are just not in your control.
Yeah but most people read the news and then think they can predict where the price is going. The news can't tell you that.
[removed]
“Jesus f’ing Christ, why did I move my stop again??” That’s the traders prayer
Lmao go to hell
Eh, this depends on your system. With Turtle Trading for example you were supposed to not close trades early even if that meant you gave back big amounts of profit.
Yep. Been guilty of that way too often for I'd like to admit.
I’m all ears about the **mechanical way of following a trend**
I use excel but also chart my trades on tradingview as a visual reference for later
I use Google sheets, TradingView (for charts and rationale), and MyFXBook.com for data.
Yeah, I think so too. Does OP mean do not let the news impact your strategy?
Check out r/wallstreetbets and you'll understand haha
Can you link some sources on that?
I leave my stop where it is until I get a countertrend move, which I define as a candle that does not break the previous candle’s high in an uptrend or low in a downtrend. After this candle appears, I wait for price to resume the trend by breaking the high or low that failed to break at the beginning of the countertrend move. At this point, I place my stop loss below the lowest or highest point reached by the countertrend move.

So, taking an uptrend as example.

* You get a series of bullish candles, all breaking the previous candle’s high. My stop does not move.
* You get a candle that does not break the previous candle’s high, signaling the beginning of the countertrend move. The color of the candle does not matter.
* After I get this countertrend candle, I mark the highest point reached by the candle before the countertrend move.
* Once this high has broken, I move my stop loss to the lowest point reached by the countertrend move.
Love TradingView
By this, do you mean screenshots? Or is there a feature on trading view to record all your trades?
What does myfxbook do? Does it just show you your trading info or does it have charts?

•	⁠Once this high has broken, I move my stop loss to the lowest point reached by the countertrend move.

Like, aren’t you susceptible to another move that is a false break before the market attempts another swing high again? Let’s take AUDUSD of last 2 weeks for example, in terms of the D1 timeframe chart.
I am new to trading but will try this. Which timeframe do use for this? Sounds like a rather short frame of 1 or 5 mins
When you draw lines and fibs and stuff on your chart, like the AMZN chart for example, it saves the drawing on there and you will see it when you look at the chart later on... you can also publish your chart as an ""idea"" to share with others, which is great to see if your trade worked out in your favor
I don’t use myfxbook for trading info, I use it for my trading statistics. You can connect your broker it analyzes your accounts read only data and it shows you your trading stats. Everything from your profit factor to your “risk of ruin”. Shows you if you’re more profitable going long or shorting. You can see the overall progression of your trading approach broken down mathematically.
No offense but if this gain per week was even remotely possible consistently we would have much more rich forex traders
Wow that’s actually an incredibly realistic goal as well
Yes I am susceptible to that. I want to ride a trend as long as it paints higher highs and lows. The moment it stops doing that, I am happy to exit and reassess
1h
You just don't know any consistent Forex traders that profit from this 😹
I see. Nice strategy although on the aggressive side. Thanks for the tip breakdown by the way.
Lol are you joking or something? If you are able to achieve 15% weekly consistently then you would have $10 compounded to 800 trillion in 50 years. Stop lying bro lol, of course it’s possible but consistency is impossible and name one forex trader worth more than a few billion lol
You don't know anyone 😹

I would not want anyone like you on my team with that mindset😹😹😹

You just put a limit on how much you can make. You got to believe and do it

Trading is not a joke if you understand how the banks manipulate the market 😹😹😹😹😹
LMAO OK THEN GO MAKE 800 trillion bucks dude, lmfao

Maybe while you are at it stop trying to trick people otherwise"

That's accurate😅
So basically you can’t afford that car if you trade? 😂
So, you're saying that I can't afford the car anyways?
Booo!!! I was laughing at every comment until you squeezed your lemon butt on here.
Sometimes instead of buying a brand new car, you have to sell your house😅
It was a joke but I don't think I made that clear
Fuck it. Sell the house, live in the car, and YOLO your account in an attempt to make all your money back.
>without a stop loss. Or with.

Well then, I don't get your very clever joke. Or do I...
the joke was that we are all broke

Have you tried using a drain plug?

Lost too much on NZD last week, how it trended down to a 4 month low... 🥲
Have you tried not placing the drain there?

Buy high, and sell only a tiny bit higher lots of times.
Idk how to put it in words, but it’s kinda like hot potato... you see how much the stock “vibrates” and where it vibrates ( what price it stays around). If it’s a technical breaking point volume has to come in the last bit to confirm a movement up it down.. careful though cause it can also be a trap... regardless have a,b,c,d, and e scenarios and always be willing to flip your decision. I wouldn’t go so hard on your first entry just in case your wrong. And if you flip your direction I would take a little more risk to make up your loss. And if your quick enough, add more! I would also only try to play support and resistance and not play in between unless your conviction is high ( I  only try to go for 3-4 cents here between 300-700-900 shares, if I’m wrong and it does against me and I have a good feeling it will vibrate around the price I double down to get a better entry ( sometimes my risk to reward messes up but I let my conviction take lead and it works for me). Also don’t try to sell at increments of five cents.. I find that selling between five cent moves is way better. Also just make sure you have a stop loss if you play with size. And if out in and the price moves in your favor raise the stop up to your entry ... sometimes if you had a good entry you won’t get stopped out sometimes you do though.. idk I find that I lose less when I do this.
I usually do the same. If your broker have low spread,  It's an opportunity,  but with  a really slow gain with shitty RR ratio."

New traders be like,696,https://i.redd.it/srqmtv3cqupa1.jpg,"When you not apreciate the smaller things, yiu will never achieve greatness. Going from 50$ to 50.69 is more then 1% growth. Adding compounding to this will evolve in a beast of a account.
On a $5,000 account that would be $69, do that 5 times a day and you can quit your day job.
I'M RICH BITCH!!

“If I easy made 69 cents with .01 lot then my next trade will be for .15 lots and make all the money!”

They might be too scared of hitting a profit target.
*Would you like to upsize your meal?*

**You bet your ass I do**
Making that 0.69$ was just made when you got scared and didn't let the either the tp get hit or the stop loss , we've all been there but you got accept one of the two , either tp or your SL
Me when I got $0.50 profit for the day 😃
Truth. Then we turn around and blow half of it :D
Real😂
Literally me
Meeeeee
*Nice*
If you can make 1% most days of the week you’re gonna be more than fine.
I don't understand, the get sad from making money? Because it's a small amount? Or is this post about something else? They get depressed?
I do this then take the money out to buy weed or uber eats
1% is 1%…better than 90% still. Of course, gotta do it consistently :)
real
Good job
Even more than that.....😂
I made 18 dollars my first 2 days with a $100 dollar deposit. I was more than appreciative.
1% gains are for the weak
Worst possible advice u can give, the thing that you won 5 times in the row (very unlikely) doesnt mean you will not loose 10 times in row after that
I'M BITCH RICH!!
The mindset of the 99% dumb money
Real Champ💪😂
They got so happy by gaining this amount at first, get carried away and traded emotionally and lose it all within a day.
LoL!!! So 1% of a 50k account is weak? Gtfo. Ever heard of the phrase, 'if you can't make money with a 100$ account, what makes you think you can make money with a 100k$ account? 

The biggest traders among us are the most humble ones.
That’s why I park my money in 5% CD while you play gambling games
Make 20 trades a day, %65 win rate = 13 wins and 7 losses, or 6 profit trades. More than enough. Obviously takes practice.
I'M RITCH BICH!!!
Ah ok..

Yeah I did something similar when I visited England when I was 12 years old.

I played some game in a pub that cost one £ to play, hit a bunch of buttons and won 50£

I then proceeded to give it all back. But stopped once my profits were all spent.
making 1% on 50k is nothing. good luck with your boring gains
Can’t even be bothered to read ur whole comment but as it stands before and now; 1% gains are for the dumb ones (unless you’re trading 100m)
If gambling got me retired at 24 call me the gambling don from now on, educate yourself mate don’t be scared of the unknown it’s gonna be ok x
BE stop lose hehehe
Sounds like a fruit machine. You don't have those in your country?
I think in prop firm standard it's good. You can probably accumulate millions of dollars worth of prop firms in a single year. If you have like 10 mil and make 3% a month even with the profit split you'll probably make 240k a month but at that point it'll probably be a good idea to make your own personal account.
Banks will pay you like 3% annual 😭 amd they run the markets
Please, enlighten us. What is your targeted gain percentage?
Got any good self-education sources?
I don't know what it was, it was some kind of machine where you had to hit a bunch of flashing lights quickly.

It wasn't a slot machine if that's what you mean by fruits
Stand on your own 2 feet mate, enlighten “us”. It’s me and you here but easy to see what umbrella you fall under but since you asked so nicely: minimum 20%
I thought you knew what you were doing? 
I’m always willing to help the little guy out, download soft4fx simulator and log trades until your eyes burn and repeat for 2 years then the word “gambling” disappears and only gets brought up by people who are scared of the market hint hint
That is a hefty target. I am impressed, personally I aim for 10%, anything above that is bonus. What is your risk? 5 to 10%?
5-10% risk a trade yes
Bellend
With proper position size that would be achievable. Been playing with that idea as well, but you need a high rr then, otherwise you could be wiped out in a couple of trades. I do like the aggresive style that comes with it.
Calm down it ain’t my fault ur poor mate
It’s not hard to accomplish at all, I aim for 1:10s making 90-100% but minimum I’ll take is 20%
😂😂
I smell manure
What timeframe you play? I am actually curious niw to your trading style. Seems like a fucking adrenaline rush on a daily basis.
You make 20% a day minimum?
You can very much learn from these reddits lol but some people  force it
Scared of the unknown
Used to be adrenaline rush before my set up was complete but thousands of hours across 6 people have gone into the set up so no emotion involved when entering trades now, plus the set up appears once or twice a month maybe
No my set up appears once or twice a month if I’m lucky
Come back in a  couple of years when you're worth 200 millions, then I'll apologize
Explain that one to me. 1000 hours accros 6 people? What?
Wait. Once or twice a month? So, average, about 30% growth per month, or 1% per day. You're shit talking about someone making in a single trade what it takes you an entire averaged day to make?

My average is .1% growth per trade, between 10-20 per day. 

I'm not trying to shit talk you, it just seems like you're choosing between $30 a month or $1.5 per day.
I don’t want an apology little man
On the simulator (backtesting) as the majority call it
Key word was minimum, but let’s go with what you said about average 30% a month; id rather do that in 2 emotionless trades, than sweating sat at a laptop all day.
Chill... Blowing accounts makes you aggressive I see
Ah, crystal. Good for you buddy. So you only trade 1 or 2 times per month. That is bliss!!!
You’re not wrong mate I blew one a few years ago and it still hurts when I think about it
Thanks, and sort of, I’m on the charts every single day backtesting and analysis for upcoming day so it ain’t all easy breeze"
The grind is real,702,https://i.redd.it/to05esrgmnv91.jpg,"He wouldn't have to sell banana's if he CLOSED that laptop...
He's not trading, he's checking the commodities price of bananas and adjusting his pricing accordingly.
while it is laughable, selling banana gives you alot of free time to trade. The only thing left is risk control and know how to trade.

Bro lemme get a banana. “Hold up bro I been waiting all hour for this trade”
Watching a chart in real time is probably still more fun than selling bananas for a living, real talk.

This is insane. Yes, the grind is real. Reddit never stops amazing me with such posts.
Very sad indicator usage.
What's the best way to create **Indicator based Alerts on Forex**?

I've created one with TradingView when Gold crosses 50 EMA,

but i want to know whether it can be done somewhere for free or inside MetaTrader itself?
Ew.

""banana trees""
Damn right !
he is the forex trader but selling banana as part time job to that people understand he is working. selling banana is the prerequisite to his wealth since he got money without working.
Fast forward 10 years, he’s selling bananas out of a lambo trunk 😂😂
Me too. I didn’t even get the joke lol
That would be double losses. 
Well, it’s about perception. This was a great joke but it can also become an inspiration for those who need motivation. Good one!

Not sure which is the side hustle, bananas or forex?
What does this mean?
Depends how many bananas get stolen when he’s too busy charting.
Theres always money… (collectively) in the banana stand
dude dont even have a set up. Just one sad two lines cross
I mean 99% of indicators are a joke. A simple rsi and ma is good for confirmation the rest is up to the eyes and brain
What is ew?
OK I'll explain the joke: Obviously this Forex trader has lost all of his money and now has to sell fruit on the side of the road to make a living.
Not really. They are not needed for successful trading but if you can make them useful, then why not use them?
mE in the mirror.
got it lol. that is funny, and I feel like an idiot lol"
