Crypto Recovery Guru Scam,128,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/pmjc99/crypto_recovery_guru_scam/,"I'm a security professional with years of experience. I've worked with the secret service and various state and county law enforcement agencies. I'm also a programmer who works on multiple platforms. I have extensive experience with systems defense, entry, social engineering, private sector and so on.

I see these types of question a lot. Here's what I have to say about it. 

**You likely cannot recover crypto from a scammer unless at least one of these conditions is true. \[*****This is not advice and I am not a lawyer!\]***

1. The wallet used is hosted on a vulnerable system which you are able to gain access to in order to send the funds out to another wallet which you control. This is what happened with the pipeline attack payments they recovered. They found vulnerable ports, accessed the system and sent it from the wallet on the server back to wallets they controlled. This only happened cause the operator was '*a fucking idiot'*. 
2. The scammer is gullible enough to fall for a similar scam in which they send that crypto to a wallet you own.
3. You can physically isolate the individual or their hardware in person. 
4. You can manipulate the scammer by targeting someone close to them.
5. You identify the individual are able to social engineer your way into their email, change their exchange passwords and send the crypto from their account(s). 
6. You're able to infiltrate their system with a piece of malicious code and change their pasted wallet addresses to yours so when they send crypto it goes right to you. 

There are of course other conditions to these that further complicate them.  I think you get the jist of what I'm saying though. If you can't get your hands on the device, seed or access the accounts/system it's likely impossible to recover your funds. 

Of course the scammer could have a change of heart, but that's not the norm. 

**One thing that needs to be acknowledged is 'Eye for an eye' and the legal systems POV on these matters:**

While you may have every bit of righteous justification to do this, the majority of courts feel differently about vigilante justice and ***can*** hold you accountable for any laws you break in the process of recovering your funds. Conspiracy is a crime in a lot of places. It's also a known tactic for law enforcement to pose as hackers, hitmen, etc so while you think you may be doing the right thing hiring a professional, it could backfire. If you aren't charged you may end up losing more money to scammers posing as hackers which would be a tragedy onto itself. 

Now it's not to say I don't think the courts would side with you in a jury situation, but it's a hassle you don't want. 

Think of it like this: A guy breaks into your house while at work and steals your TV. You either can call the cops or go hunt him down. If you hunt him down and hurt him, you just broke the law and while your situation EXPLAINS the root of the problem, it does not excuse your actions. 

If you call the cops and they end up chasing him, there's damages and violence - you aren't at fault or involved at all.

So while it's not the manly 'run and gun' answer I think we all like, it's a smart choice that you can live with without further losses.

&#x200B;

**What can I do?**

I highly recommend reporting this to whatever government agency represents online fraud and financial crimes in your country. They likely can't recover the funds, but it beats digging yourself into a deeper hole losing more money hiring fake hackers or real defense attorneys.

Talk to reputable, well known WHITE HAT hackers and see if they're interested in helping. They might be willing to help for free. 

**Any hacker worth their weight in salt won't ask for payment up front. They'll simply hold a small portion of what's retrieved.** 

&#x200B;

**To prevent future scams** 

I would not trust any exchange outside of your country of origin. I would not accept any invites to new exchanges, swaps, liquidity pools or anything like that. I would simply buy the coin you want, move it to an offline wallet like a Ledger and keep that in a very secure place.

Keep your dating and investing life separate. Don't mention crypto on dating sites, ever.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Now I'm gonna go get some Hardees.

***This is digital gold. You need to treat it as such.***
so apparently there are lawyers out there that can help recoup losses, but their prices are steep so i cannot afford to go further as the price they are asking is like more than 1/4 of what i lost and it not in the cards, but there is help out there, from actual lawyers
Add ""Phantom Geeks"" to this supposedly list Recovery Experts, they will give you a bill of BS and take as much money as possible from you promising a 100% guarantee.  Don't buy their BS for any amount, I personally lost over $8K from these jerks!
Thank you for the post! I just got contacted by a guy recommending a guy on ins saying he helped him recover lost funds... I contacted the guy on ins and they are asking for 100USD upfront payment. Thank you for this post, you just saved me from another scam!
I had someone ask for 15k upfront almost did it but didn‚Äôt have enough funds to pay him. Was even willing to take a bank loan to do it.
I don't know.... when it comes to recovery, I would start with my institutions ""immediately"", timing is key.
Scammers create a scam industry where scammers do whatever they can to screw over a helpless victim just for some ill gotten cash.
Is there any real recovery service?
Beware they will private message you too pretending to also be scammed and got the money back
Is this a scam?

great üëç  thx for the heads uo.
Does anyone have experience with 'PayBack LTD' recovery services?
I have scammed in trade and some people told me they could help me to take some of my money back‚Ä¶ but they may be scammers too
/u/MathematicianTop2215 already messaged me trying to initiate a ""crypto recovery guru"" scam.
I agreed let‚Äôs spread the words to the people 

Scammers belong in jail for stealing peoples money
I totally agree, don't waste your time and money trying to recover the unrecoverable.  There are so many scams out there assuring you they have the capability to recover your losses for a fee.  Don't buy that line of BS because that all it is, merely another scam!
I just got a message like this.  ‚ÄúMake sure you contact swamp_hacker on instagram‚Äù.  Gave me an email.  He says he went on the dark web explorer and was able to recover my funds.  Of course then he tells me I need to buy a PYTHON CODE for 1278 in etherium.   When I said hold on, I‚Äôll research, he said ‚Äúyour recovery will be on hold and then we can‚Äôt help you‚Äù
What about radleyreclaim?

I was contacted by a company that says they work on a no win no fee basis with no money up front. Is this possible has anyone heard of this website? https://dps-cybersecurity.com/

You can't ban me because I wanted to promote you and you are acting in the opposite way.
So I got a call yesterday saying that the website has been confirmed as a scam. They have settled a class action lawsuit and if I want to retrieve my funds I have to go to fraud-check.org, put in a case number and then go to bcb-escrow.com and fill out these forms. Seems like a scam in itself

IF ANYONE ASKS FOR MONEY, it‚Äôs a scam 


If someone asks for the scammers BTC wallet where you sent the funds to, they are legitimately trying to help. As long as they do not ask for money or any of YOUR information, it‚Äôs safe

 I say this as a victim of a BTC scam, and I know who my scammer is. When digging further I learned he is a MASSIVE BTC scammer and I have the wallet information and text threads to link
Him

 So working with the FBI and SS, we have located several other victims of his simply by getting the BTC wallet the victim sent the money to, we can link Destination wallets (follow the money).

 No one can scam you with providing the SCAMMERS BTC wallet, so if you have been scammed by BTC, and post the scammers BTC wallet here, we can check if you scammer is linked to our scammer with ZERO of your info. Just need the scammers BTC wallet funds were sent to and we can help identify him if he is linked 

You would be shocked how many‚Äôs we are finding that‚Äôs linked, I know I am

And had he not scammed me, he wouldn‚Äôt be caught. Because I can identify him as I know him and he scammed me face ti face, not online, so I know who he is and can oink his wallets to others (and we are as we speak).

 If anyone asks for money or your info, it‚Äôs a scam
Has anyone heard of cybershark591@gmail.com I was told this person could help me recover funds I messeaged him he said he could help me but I believe he‚Äôs also a scammer and I‚Äôm not trusting it any thoughts ???

Put this on the list Encrytp - encrypuil.com/h5 3 1/2 mths old site - Never get your money back One of the scammers who will be happy to lead you in there on Facebook is Monica Chen, using pictures like 30 or 40 other profiles of Naomi Cheng a model & friend of Kane Lim
All that can be done is to do a lot of blockchain research, using free and paid blockchain analytics, follow patiently every wallet involved, and try to link to a KYC exchange. 

And then pray that the scammer was from the same jurisdiction as you or from a place where your country has some extraterritorial jurisdiction to be able to follow/prosecute the scammer. 

(e.g. not form North Korea)

Online scams are becoming more sophisticated and many people fall victim to them it can be very upsetting,  if you have been a victim  of scam and its vital to report to the internet crime complaint center  ,I managed to get in direct contact with JAYDIM which you can reach out to them on their website ( Jaydimhack.com ) If you‚Äôve been unfortunate enough to lose money through one of these schemes like romance scam, bitcoin or credit card scam; there are specialists that can assist in recouping what you lost, at least most of it. They helped me recover most of money after i gave out my credit card details to a scammer and all my money was wiped out of my account, Be smart! Mind who you invest I was lucky enough to find this article that all about Helping victims get their funds back. I invested $820k with this company mooningexchange which they claimed I won‚Äôt be able to withdraw if I don‚Äôt invest more, luckily jaydim came through for me.

I have a person send a message here e then ofer to recover my cripto asked my WhatsApp number. Until now just asking more money fees etc but not transfer my assets. I spend 1500 euros. It's another scammer?
Exactly what ive been told by lawyers and police, i have been confronted to several of these ""ethical hackers"" who said they can recover my funds but as soon as they ask for money up front i know its not real. If they are going to recover so much money why do they need the money up front when they can take a percentage off after? Down payments, buying software, etc will just cause you to lose more money, and once they figure out they can swindle a couple extra bucks off you they will make up another excuse and try again and again
As somebody who you could say is a gray hat, this is fact. Sure you can get it back, but you‚Äôll have to break many laws to do so. Your money is gone. All you can do is report to local authorities.

How would your institutions help for a crypto scam?
There might be, but unfortunately none of us know of any yet. It will have to be one that takes a portion of your recovered funds and sends you back just the recovered amount minus the fees. Paying upfront or before getting the fees back is an obvious recovery scam.
Coinbase is supposed to be a legit app, but check the email of who sent that? Is the domain @ [coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com)? Also, did you actually make a withdrawal from your coinbase?

Maybe, dont confirm using the email. This is a very tough one actually.
Complete and total scam
I hear they ask you to pay in advance, and they claim that if you cancel within 14 days, you get a refund, but who says they will refund you? Also, even if they were not a scam, there is no guarantee they could recover your funds, and then, you basically just lost additional money.

Update.  Swamp_hacker (swamp hacker) accepted venmo services payment.  So I figured what the hell, venmo has me covered.  So I pay 1275.  Of course then he says he needs to me to put another 960 for a crash code.  I tell him no. So he says he‚Äôll cover it.  Next thing you know he says he‚Äôs recovers 3x my losses (140k) from this wallet and all I need to do is pay the gas fees (4000) in eth.  After I say I want a refund, he ghosts me.  Fucking scammer!!
Bullshit
This was one of the scammers ^
They have been dealt with
This is literally one of the people I'm talking about. THIS IS A SCAMMER

They didn't even read the post which is fucking hilarious

You would get an official mail from a government agency, as far as I know, or a lawyer who represents a class action lawsuit ‚Ä¶. I lost too much because I did not know and didn‚Äôt use my head.. I did not search deep enough on Reddit too üòî I‚Äôm very depressed

Hey I want to ask, some recovery guru on Reddit PM me to create new Safepal empty wallet and give him the mnemonic phrase. Later $820 is received there I was asked to deposit $55 BNB for gas fee in that wallet to convert PVM to BTC/USDT, is this a sc*m?
I lost over $10k in BTC and USDT. It was a ‚Äúfake‚Äù exchange called ‚ÄúBitsypay‚Äù where the guy who scammed me told me when and what crypto to contract trade. The BTC address I sent my funds to is: 1KDAcgA6wk43u7uRpcYWE7L4YXbfZyj7qk and the USDT(ERC20) address I sent my funds to is: 0x4a79884140d7b24e3d9e35eceda38185f47cc9fd

Please let me know if you find anything. I am still struggling to get over this severe loss.
No one can recover your money. If you knew how Blockchain works, you would know that it‚Äôs impossible to recover stolen crypto unless the scammer made a mistake. There‚Äôs no such thing as recovery Services, even the legitimate recovery services. I really just stay scammer that portrays. He has good intentions or runs it like a business that is just taking advantage of people. A few simple rules to never lose your money. Number one do not keep your crypto in a hot wallet number, remember, not your Keys not your crypto. Number two there are no such thing as recovery companies and number three stop putting your money on exchanges. Keep your private keys to your cold wallets, in a place that doesn‚Äôt or can‚Äôt ever connect to a network. No pictures, no cupboards, no nothing. Keep it written down on a piece of paper, in a couple of different locations. Like in a safe, or hidden floor tile or behind a picture frame. You get the idea.

They cannot. They will use an example of a sketchy 2015 case as an example, none have been successful since. Report to authorities, learn from mistakes and move on. Sorry, but that‚Äôs the facts.
Cryptolegal.uk is a scam so delete that. I told him he could keep 20x his fee($1500usd x 20) to do it considering he thought he was going to be so successful and‚Ä¶.no reply. They are scamming you.

It‚Äôs not tough at all?!?!?!? I am dumbfounded that people fall for any scam? People will never learn. I have never been scammed in 37 years. Can I tell you why I have never been scammed? If you follow a couple of simple rules, you will never be scammed. 

For example, the coinbase email above‚Ä¶.? I could tell that was a scam in less than 5 seconds of reading it. What is one thing all scammers have in common? 
They can‚Äôt spell‚Ä¶ not a single one of them can spell and their grammar is terrible! I mean come on people, do you really think Coinbase would make the same mistakes a 10 year old would make? NO!!!! Use your head people. And learn how blockchain and crypto work before you go investing your hard earned money into it. Fun fact: if you knew how crypto and blockchain works, than you would know that it‚Äôs impossible to recover your funds. So all of these recovery companies, every single one of them, is a scam! Unfortunately, if you had your money stolen or hacked, you cannot blame anyone else but your self. That very reason is what makes blockchain and crypto so safe and secure. If you knew how block chain works then this would make since to you. It‚Äôs so much safer than our current financial systems in just about every possible way besides your own stupidity. Now look, I‚Äôm not calling anyone stupid that has been scammed, but, I am calling you irresponsible for not learning how something works before you invest your hard earned money in it. And further more, coinbase and any centralized exchange is corrupt and needs to be shut down. CEX‚Äôs are everything that is wrong about crypto. They go against the fundamental building blocks of the purpose of cryptocurrency‚Äôs. Cryptocurrency isn‚Äôt supposed to be regulated. If you regulate it, then IT puts us right back to square one with the US dollar. It was designed not to be regulated, that very idea is what‚Äôs completely stops any type of fraud. Most frauds are committed due to a vulnerability in that 3rd party during a tx. When you sign up with a bank online, you just opened up two new avenues for a theif to steal from you. It‚Äôs actually way more than two, but for the sake of keeping it simple. You  make a username and password which creates the first vulnerability. Then you send it across a public free WiFi network cause your at Starbucks and don‚Äôt know any better. Meanwhile, hackers are sniffing your packets while talking to you at the same time drinking coffee. Then you are litterally trusting a third party, ie, like a bank, with your username and password. So people or institutions you don‚Äôt know, they could litterally give two fucks about you, as you are just a number in a database to them. There are so many more examples, I could go on and on. 
Look the point I‚Äôm trying to make is blockchain and crypto fix all of those issues above as it takes away that 3rd party vulnerability. The banks. And who in the crypto space reminds you of a bank? Crypto exchanges! They act exactly as a bank. They take your money, loan it out for a return then when you withdrawal, you pray, that they are maintaining liquidity and your withdrawal will be successful. Exactly like a bank! Same problems.same fraud, same players. Exchanges are making crypto centralized. They are ruining crypto. Plus look at how much money has been lost by theses shady crypto exchanges. Unless you get to hold your own keys then that crypto has never been yours. Not your keys, not your crypto. 
Anyways, be smart people, use your head. And remember what rules the world and governs the world. 
Power and Greed rule the world. Always has and unfortunately always will. The only way to combat that  evil is by decentralizing everything not allowing a single centralized means. then it's up to you to keep your money safe. which is very simple if you utilize Blockchain in cryptocurrencies people keep saying on post all over that bitcoin is centralized. and that statement couldn‚Äôt be  more wrong. bitcoin has never been centralized as the way it was created and the fact that it‚Äôs immutable and transparent is the same reason it‚Äôs decentralized. Now, if people keep investing their money, or using these centralized exchanges, like QC coins, Binance, Coinbase, Gemini, anyone of these then you are literally helping to make bitcoin, governed and centralized, and basically turn it into the US dollar bill, which will ruin capitalism just as the US dollar and power and greed has ruined capitalism here in America. right now keep it decentralized like the way it was intended, learn how Blockchain works in Why it works before you go dumping your money into it and all of this fraud stops.
Thanks, mod.  Any info as to why?

Late reply, but what makes you say that? I am aware paying upfront or before getting funds back is a scam, but what about if you are not paying until you get your funds back.
I believe the same scammer got me too‚Ä¶$57,500!
Thank you for the tips I assumed I was screwed so I‚Äôm not pressed was just curious if It was somehow possible to recover what was stolen and I understand blockchains enough but obviously I‚Äôm no expert hence why I was robbed but ultimately ik it was all my fault for allowing such a thing to happen but again thank you for the tips it‚Äôs much appreciated

Jaredspivey.. He is a scammer too!
how have you been doing lately?
omg
I also lost the same amount. What should we do?
I completely disagree. In my experience, Crypto Legal presented me with a comprehensive proposal to handle my case, showcasing a great track record and a team of reputable solicitors based in the UK.

Solicitors are legal professionals, not bounty hunters. The idea of a solicitor working for free with the expectation of far-fetched profits is simply nonsense.

Update: Upon checking your profile I can see that you are promoting recovery scams... your comment should be deleted and your profile banned from Reddit...scammer!

I dont know if you live in a mostly white town in America, but a lot of places in America are saturated with a foreigner-majority, like the Bay Area and Los Angeles area, so people there will have trouble not falling for these scams. Even if spelling and grammar were not of an issue, a lot of scammers can spell and have good grammer if they grew up in America. It is good you went 37 years without getting scammed. That is nice. However, avoiding a scam is much harder than avoiding a gambling debt.
Payback Ltd is an Advance fee scam. You pay, nothing happens. They plug reviews and stuff to make themselves look successful but they‚Äôre powerless and there are warnings about them
did you ever find out if that recovery guy was law enforcement? Alfred Fregun?
No one can get your funds back except law enforcement. I can trace where the money went for days but cannot recoup anything without a seizure warrant
What was the name he used?
[removed]
I‚Äôm good. I‚Äôm currently able to pay my debt and still have money to live okay. But, damn, it sure bites knowing I let this happen to me. I had no clue about these scams when it started so I was easy prey. As soon as the romance scammer understood I was tapped she gave me the heave ho and split. Weird thing is she asked me to friend her on a new profile on FB. She/hey have about 20 diferentes profiles across social media of her, with a thread of consistency in the names: Sunny Haha, Sun Yhaha, sunny haha. Then there are the odd ones with different names but same pictures. There‚Äôs a guy that placed messages on a few of the accounts saying he wanted his crypto back. üò≥üò≥ so I was not their first.
Thanks
No I didn‚Äôt
Yep and recovery scammers claim they can recoup it that easily.
Henry.
Wow. Mine still on my IG . but its so that I can keep an eye out. Keep my enemies closer kind of thing. I‚Äôm glad to hear that you‚Äôre doing okay. We are the fortunate ones .. you and I. Others ‚Ä¶ not so much. This fucking blows.
Can I ask what website you were scammed on?  I was scammed on Tokentop.co over a year ago.  The site has shut down but I have all the chat logs, etc
darn. I was hoping for a miracle.
He called himself Stuart with me. Were you able to get anything back?
Haha! That‚Äôs funny‚Äîthe contact. The person and I still follow each other on IG as well‚Äîsame reason.
BWgamonline . Com 
I started following the the transaction threads of their wallet addresses and saw some interesting transaction traffic‚Äîsecond/third order addresses.
I really didn‚Äôt ask because I haven‚Äôt really responded to any of the recovery people.  I‚Äôll let you know if I do.  If you want, dm me and we could continue chat tomorrow
Yes, I‚Äôve had mine traced also.
You have to love the blockchain for its transparency of transactions.
Site is no longer online
Do you happen to have the BTC address for BWgamonline?  Am also interested in the transaction traffic.  Thanks!!!!

Not a scam though - Presearch probably flagged you for manipulating their reward program. To receive your rewards you are supposed to use the browser as normal, if you solely spam 25 random searches everyday you will get flagged and lose your accumulated rewards.

good luck getting your PRE transferred out of the PRE wallet.  this is done ""manually"" by the presearch team supposedly upon request.  they falsely keep the PRE token from going to zero by not allowing you to transfer PRE out of the PRE wallet to other wallets like metamask.

if you run presarch nodes... be careful not to post any type of criticism of the project... the presearch team will manipulate your nodes such that they will not be able to connect to anything other than testnet = resulting in a reduced reliability score and zero (or very few) node rewards.

this is shady as F\*CK!  i have lost all respect for presearch and their shady A$$ F\*CK team."

As a rule of thumb: If you're doubting whether the site is a scam, it probably is.

Our advice is to withdraw your money from the scam site if possible, transfer your money out of the wallet, cut contact, and contact law enforcement. If you confront the scammers about being unable to withdraw the money, they may guilt trip you into paying more [fees](https://sites.google.com/view/scammerce/scams/advance-fee) to do that, for example asking for money to pay ""taxes"" and offering to cover a part of your expenses.

If you manage to withdraw your money from the scam site, transferring it out of your compromised cryptocurrency wallet ensures that it is now out of reach of the scammers. Report the scammers to the platform and block them, but do not delete chat logs. The evidence has to be preserved for law enforcement. Law enforcement is often not qualified or motivated to recover your money, but if you are unable to get your money back, they are your only option. Even if they do not help you in the end, reporting the scam will at least alert them to the problem, keeping it on the radar.

Unfortunately, no hacker online can get back what you've lost. Please watch out for [recovery scams](https://sites.google.com/view/scammerce/scams/recovery), a follow-up scam done after victims have fallen for an earlier scam. Recently, there has been a rise in scammers DMing members of the subreddit to offer recovery services. A form of the advance-fee, victims are convinced that the scammer can recover their money. This ""help"" can come in the form of fake hacking services or authorities. 

If you see anyone circumventing the scam filters, please report the submission and we will take action shortly.

You promised him a receipt within 48h? It seems pretty black and white.  Did you or not ?
There were never any S9s, right?
No none of this is true. This person has been spreading false information for months. Leaving bad reviews everywhere they can. He‚Äôs been contacted via the better business bureau and a refund has been suggested multiple times. It‚Äôs a personal vendetta
he blocked me, so i can't see his reply.  i am still waiting on any contact from muskminers.  No one has offered me a receipt much less a refund

yeah i don't think there's any problem with publicly sharing receipts.  you're making a huge assumption u/muskminers is going to come thru on a self imposed deadline they already missed tho
It looks like time example and tiny entertainers are the same person saying the same thing. Very interesting they are both ONLY participating in this thread

Does that include the receipt you said you‚Äôd give him in that photo he edited in? Why not dm it to him at least ?
I can understand arguing over money.  But a receipt? Don‚Äôt you keep receipts ?

haha, let me forward the message he sent thru the BBB.  this is a quote 

""I do see we are getting duplicate receipts and will process his refund within 48 hours"" 

&#x200B;

short, sweet, and false.  Maybe he meant 48d?
and do you claim to run muskmining in your comment history?

and to think he would accuse us of such a crime. smh

Any chance you could help with that receipt, Junkie?
Wait? So you have been contacted with progress in the matter?
[removed]
i wish.   i was the one who contacted the BBB after months of no contact.  This was his RESPONSE. he told them the same lie he told us on reddit.  the 48h passed with no attempted contact much less a refund or receipt :(

If you have been scammed using a third party Dapp and want to see the scammers behind the bars, in jail, you have only one way.

From your wallet follow all transactions with https://ethplorer.io/ reporting in a list:
...
From wallet:
To Wallet:
Transaction n. :
...

The last wallet (but all the list have to be reported) to focus is the one before the spot wallets from:

- Binance-14 0x28C6c06298d514Db089934071355E5743bf21d60

- OKEx .... e.g. OKex 7 is 0x5041ed759Dd4aFc3a72b8192C143F72f4724081A  

- or final wallets in platforms like satangcorp, bitazza or similar....

From your investigations you will discover a new dark world.....Several wallets whose owner can be identified and penally punished.

These informations are accessible by Binance or other big Trading Platforms.

Go to law enforcement, provide a doc file. and explaining exactly what happened to you.

From small figures to high figures. Reported. This cancer in the crypto world will have to end. Law enforcement will adapt over time. Perhaps the scammers will be dead but we help to ensure that this does not happen again and that we can quickly guarantee exemplary and fast punishments.

All the scammers in jail. If you throw the keys away, it's better.

I did research , collected proofs of my own experience , I even captured a picture of a scammer on WhatsApp video chat.

I'd like to inform you about a dApps web URLs misusing trust of users, promising interest of 2% a day by mining Ethereum. In a few days they ask you for extra money under the pretext of a contest, gain full access to a wallet and withdraw your money. In case you want your money back, they ask you to add extra money.

This company is running as a dApp under a full range of addresses, namely emwa.xyz, emwb.xyz, emwc.xyz, emwd.xyz, emwe.xyz, emwf.xyz, emwg.xyz, emwi.xyz, emwj.xyz, emwk.xyz, emwl.xyz, emwm.xyz, emwn.xyz, emwo.xyz, emwp.xyz, emwq.xyz, emwr.xyz, emws.xyz, emwt.xyz, emwu.xyz, emwv.xyz, emww.xyz, emwy.xyz, emwz.xyz, emgc.xyz, emgd.xyz and probably others.

A new one that I likely lost around $200 in, creditcoin.cc . Asian woman goes by Sakurako, from ""Japan"", phone number +44 7838415605 (should have known better since this area code is the UK, talks to you for a few weeks before talking about crypto and how ""she knows things nobody else does and wants to help."" Then sends a link to ""mobile.creditcoin.cc"" I should have known it was a scam right then. Luckily I never took out a loan for the 9k I told them I did. I'm just leading them on at this point to hopefully just waste their time so they can't do this to someone else in the meantime. Be careful and trust your gut. Don't be greedy. Earn money with a legitimate trading app that is trustworthy if you are going to mess with crypto.

I lost lots USDT to this website that was inside of Coinbase wallet and it was uniswap-WME.com. They did allow you to withdraw a small amount of investment but when you withdraw all your investments, they asked me to pay 10% miner‚Äôs fee from my own packet and after paid the miner‚Äôs fee, they asked me to pay crypto tax to them from my own pocket as well. When I told them I would pay crypto tax to IRS directly, now they didn‚Äôt allow me to withdraw my money. This scammer is using WhatsApp as their customer service.

I was recently scammed by someone who was on Hinge. They connected me to a mining pool with my wallet on MetaMask.

Initially, I started with a small investment of $1,200. After the account was generating 2% per day for a week, I ended up injecting an additional $21k into the fund. Around Thanksgiving time, there was a promotion going on where if you put $100k into the wallet they would give you 12.4 ETH as a gift. I wasn't able to come up with a $100k. Shortly afterwards in Dec, there was another promotion that happened that if you put $50k into pledged mining  you could get double the mining rewards for 7 days, $100k for 15 days. To participate in this promotion, you had to send the funds to an outside wallet, which I ended up doing. At the end of the promotion, I wanted to withdraw the funds. The customer service on the platform communicated that I needed to pay taxes, which seemed legit because it was the end of the year. I paid the taxes, but shortly afterwards they asked for 50% of the total asset value to be injected into my initial wallet before I could withdraw the funds. I couldn't come up with $40k, but they did allow a reduction to $10k plus ID verification. I had to send my ID and add $10k into the wallet, which I ended up doing. After the funds were injected and I communicated with customer service, they were long gone with the $10k and stopped responding to any communication thread. Total investment lost was $57k.

I‚Äôve awarded that it might be a scam so I tried to withdraw my money out of the wallet, once I summit withdraw, the money is all gone. I asked customer service and they said my fund has been frozen cuz I privileged the contract. I need to have 50% of my fund in wallet so that I can get my money back, so I did and they said they sent my money back to my mining pool account and I can withdraw it. After I saw my money back to pool account I withdrew it, turns out the money is freeze in block 3-4? And I have to put more money 50% of my total fund in, so I can get the insurance from them they can sort out the lawsuit stuff. ‚Ä¶ which I did it again and to be honest I know I‚Äôve been scammed.. but I still gave it the last try.. and now the fund in showing in their website but they said cuz my insurance expired so I have to buy the insurance to withdraw my money‚Ä¶.

I would like to let everyone know that i was scammed for $7000. I received friend request on face book from Regina Eric and she called herself professional trader, bitcoin mining, forex etc. Asked me if i was interested in investing in bitcoin mining etc.We chatted on messenger and then switched to WattApp, 
Sent me to a platform called Metapenstock.com and it looked really legit. I invested $500in etheruem and she said all i had to do was watch her trade. First 24hr i made $1500 and then in total i invested $2000 in Ethereum. She said she recommended investing for a month for bigger gains and said i could with draw on February 26th, anyways my supposable profit ended up being $23,500. She also told me before that she charged 20% commission fee to do the trading. I thought the 20% would just come out of my total profit but when it was time to withdraw she informed me that i had to pay the 20% on separate transaction and again that was $5100 in Ethereum. Then after i paid that while i was waiting for the deposit to be made in bitcoin she informed me i had one more step to do and that there was a bitcoin pin fee of $3200. 
By then i new i had been scammed and i have not sent anymore crypto to that address. These guys are really sophisticated scammers. Now i just feel really stupid and mad at my self for believing any of it. 0x757A16EC348A25CaA546A42318FA362B35263765 thats the Ethereum wallet address. Im just sick to my stomach. She still messaging me say please trust her that this is the last step to the process. I have everything saved from conversions . Please can anyone give me good advice on what to do to recover my funds? Everyone be ware of this Scam

Oh I got a good one with Billner Group! I closed my trades, only to gain a profit of $45 from my initial investment. So finally one of their managers calls me this morning, and is willing to refund it to me. Well what do you know, my ‚Äúconsultant‚Äù had me in a special trade, in ethereum, and took profit of just over $4000! And that if I wanted to make a withdrawal, I would have to pay them 35% taxes on it! So I told him, keep the profits, I just want my initial investment back. I don‚Äôt know exactly how the tax laws work there, but I asked them to take the taxes out of my profits, and transfer my initial balance. No different than if I cashed in some mutuals, the taxes get taken off of the withdrawal. But they still wouldn‚Äôt work with me, so now I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth persuing, since it‚Äôs a small amount. Not sure what to do at this point though, and ideas?
I would like to add one too, https://www.antlever.top/ant/
I got scammed into putting 1k in and now I‚Äôm told I need to pay taxes to get anything back. He thinks he can get me to pay by ‚Äúpaying part of it‚Äù for me.

For anyone looking to truly invest in Crypto,  keep in mind that most regulated brokers don't have a minimum deposit fee and the only time you would have to add funds to your trading account would be if you simply want to so that your profits would be larger, you withdrawed your funds,  or you blew your trading account. You can also continue to compound from your initial investment to the broker.

I know that this isn't helpful towards identifying scams but I felt compelled to share this information considering how I see some of you got scammed out of $40K plus and I think that's the case because alot of you never traded on a legit regulated platform before. I only got scammed out of $120.00 because I realized that the broker I was trading on was fugazi just simply off the deposit amounts necessary just to trade any currency yet alone Bitcoin. Plus the scammer didn't even know what Binary trading was which is exactly what the scam is based off (time based trading).

Plus there is an additional way to trade Bitcoin but that may require atleast $300 on an MT4 broker simply due to the margins. However the traditional way of trading Bitcoin will require knowledge of how to calculate a TP (take profit)  and a SL ( stop loss). The person who was trying to scam me didn't know what neither of these things were. Ask as much questions as possible when coming across these scammers that way you can at thr very least minimize the bleeding from your life savings. But if you ask these questions from the jump, I promise you that they will retreat because you will be too smart for them to scam. My scammer is slowly pulling back now that she realizes that I'm smarter than I initially let on.
Pay careful attention to the URL of the website that you are depositing your money in.  Usually it is an additional letter added.  Two examples I know of:
coinjarq.com
coinjarr.com

It is meant to get you to believe that you are depositing your money into the legitimate Coinjar website. Pay attention to the details.
www.higcrypto.com is a scam site. Please do not invest in it. It is that asian girl/pug butchering scam.  The reason why we all got scammed is to make a lot of profit in less time.

, I‚Äôve just done the same. Savings are Gonski. Eth20-Authorised. It started with some small profits then the opportunity to join a larger pledge pool, couldn‚Äôt meet the minimum pledge. They keep asking for more and more, then so they tax you more and more each day as a penalty. 

Hardest part to accept is that you‚Äôve make the mistake, I‚Äôm just going through this now. It‚Äôs just started.

I don‚Äôt think we will be getting the money back. It‚Äôs out there. From what I read on Reddit all companies propose to get your funds back are also scammers

I also filed a report with the internet crimes FBI division
Yes, just happened to me, the truth coming out just this week that I can't get my money back out of the exchange.   Been using the app AiTradeMateFX6,  it was on the apple app store, but has now since been removed.   and the Brokerage HYHLB group looked legit, but I didn't dig deeper into looking at it.    The scammer that befriended me (originally Facebook but then on WhatsApp) and traded with me on this site had me win huge profits, now looks like was all faked.  I'd love to see them all thrown in jail.   What can we do?    And embarrassed as hell to tell many people.
Guys u/OkOriginalTo is a scammer he just DM me and offering me recovery scam , how do I report him as scammer ?
Yep! Got contacted for a ¬´¬†job¬†¬ª. It went ok until my account balance went negative and I had to supplement the negative in order to ¬´¬†complete¬†¬ª the task and withdraw profit. But the more I supplemented, the higher the negative balance became. I tried contacting the Ops Manager and I always get the same response: you need to complete your task to get your money back. They encourage you to try different crypto platforms to enable you to transfer them more money so that you ¬´¬†can complete the task and withdraw your profit¬†¬ª.  If you get contacted on WhatsApp for a ¬´¬†job¬†¬ª which salary is paid crypto only, RUN!!!!!
I am still searching , how do I reach out FBI and get help ?
Yes, I am in the exact same situation. I am sending you a private message. I've filed a report with the FBI. You should do the same if you haven't already.

How did you discover all of these? Did you report all of them?
Im in one of these dApps - [emgy.xyz](https://emgy.xyz)

And, so far, it actually gives 2% of the value you have of your USDT + the 88USDT

Im in it for almost 2 weeks and no problems at all and i have already redeemed 30 usdt.

Im not saying that this is not a scheme or scam, but we can always take advantage of  it.
Yes, but they get 10-20k reports/day.

Hi, I think I may have been scammed. I made a little money from a small investment. Then they showed me how to withdraw it to my bank account, through CoinBase. 

I put in more money, a lot more. Had a feeling it was a scam but thought if it is in a trading app, I could easily pull it out. I was trying to figure out how, if it was a scam they would earn the money. It took almost the entire month of December to hit. I made $7200 profit one night. 

The more money in the higher the profits. So I started working to get more money. But before I added more, I wanted to see if I could get what I already had out. Sure enough, when I tried to withdraw it, my funds were all frozen.

I had googled BTCBOX but didn't see any scams, especially this one until the day my funds froze. I guess I googled BTCBOX scams and saw this post and the nature of the long con. Chinese lady, beautiful photos, problem showing video. They connected on LinkedIn. The first time this has ever happened on LinkedIn. You are right, the Chinese women are targeting professional men.

Anyway, my funds are currently frozen and hopefully will be released. I wasn't going to add more money if I couldn't take out what I already had in. 

If I don't get my funds released by 1/1, I will have to find out who to contact and to file a report. I'd appreciate any help.

Unfortunately, I caught this community too late.

Scammers manually approve the withdrawals in many of these cases, so think from their perspective. I don't think they ever let you withdraw all of the money you put in.
> that is *paid* are near

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

Same link and similar situation happened to me. 

They had this recent event where you get a reward of 1% usdt for 10 days if you have 20k-50k-100k etc in your trust wallet. They will ask for your receiving address and withdraw your funds to the 'reservation pool' until you can deposit the same amount within 7 days to complete the 'activity' otherwise you risk your funds getting frozen.

 So I managed to find funds to complete the activity, but when I went to withdraw, the amount went into the freeze section.  I then contacted the online services and they said because I wanted to withdraw such a large amount I now need to deposit 30% of my funds in order to activate a 'large-withdrawal function'.

 Apparently it was my mistake of not putting the 'exact' amount of 30% so the 'system' failed to activate the function. That 30% then went into the mining pool and I had to find another 30% within 3 days to try again. üôÉ

Let's just say lesson was learnt the hard way.

It's hard to say until you've experienced every step from it. But nowadays, almost all of these investment platforms are scam, using similar schemes to lure you into its honeypot, until you've lost tons of money. Like the old saying, if it's too good to be true, it's mostly fake.
I saw exactly the same comments in another post, different whatsapp number: 1(847) 920-4353. Is this actually a follow-up scam to victims?
>I lost a ton of Asset, when I reported to local authorities I was told since crypto is untraceable, there is nothing they can do about it. couldn‚Äôt get any help from them until I contacted the service of a professional ethical hacker..he hacked into the bitcoin address I made payment to and recoup my stolen crypto‚Ä¶..showed me the transaction history of these scammers I was in shock, he saved me from depression..if you are looking to recoup your crypto file a complaint to him on WhatsApp +1(336)564-6511

The small redemptions are part of the scam (psychological manipulation) to win your trust. DO NOT PUT IN MORE MONEY. No meaningful amount of funds will be returned.

Test it, try to withdraw everything and they will tell you to pay a fake tax or fee.
Hi
I have 5000 assets at INT-BITRUE and I can't withdraw money. I was asked to pay +1040 usdt to my wallet for them to pay my taxes (with no information about HOW they are going to do it). If i don't do it tomorrow I will have to double my assets to release account. Otherwise account will be blocked until i pay. Is it a fact of scam? Help to understand please.

Hello there! Your post/comment has been removed because it violates our community rule against advertising or spam. Worse than that, you were banned before, made a new account, and tried to do the same thing again. Get lost oloshi!
They never let you withdraw all the money. It is stolen and transferred somewhere else. They will only let you withdraw small amounts as a ‚Äútest‚Äù to get the victim to trust the system. (Yep, this is a manual process so they must ‚Äúgive you instructions.‚Äù)
I might have had to do with an love fraudster.  He's Peruvian but living in Virginia, US.

Yes. It is follow up scam. Scammers are trying to divert you to WhatsApp where scammers can work on you a little bit more.
Another paid service nothing different from all online recovery services., will ask for paying money for its service and not guaranteed at all.
A catfish sent it to me on Twitter after trying to gain my trust for a few days. Reverse image searched the pictures of the woman and found the real one.
Yea it definitely sucks man but it‚Äôs a tough lesson learned.
Yeah, I did just that and they got suspicious and no longer talk to me. But they tried to introduce me to himmel (?) So I guess add that to the list of scam sites and avoid it. Best I can tell it's like another do shopping thing.
Thanks
Yeah he tried to get at me too. I didn't respond.
is it must relate to  Coinbase Wallet?
See if the site will come back up and try to withdraw. Otherwise I‚Äôm sorry consider it gone. I‚Äôm just curious how you ended up there.
Similar here, lost $40k. Fucks sake
Same here... around 75K.  These MF's!  It's my own fault... makes one feel like total crap tho.  They took more than just money from me.
Similar here last yr oct.2022 . Lost 70k. Hard to swallow..
Has anybody been scammed by IC Markets ([m.iccaltd.com](https://m.iccaltd.com))? They scammed with my $54k of my retirement fund. I invested with them through investment club at Viber since April 2023 and joined their :super plan"" which Nancy the moderator giving us the daily trade signals. After the completion she said that we can withdraw the money and pay commission after the withdrawal. When I was withdrawing my money they said I have problem with credit score and I need to pay 2% of the money I made which is $ 2.7 million. I realized then that it is their scam. They lower my credit score out of the blue and they are using that to extort more money.
Earlier this year I lost a total of $140k to byxgofficial.com and starwell (iOS app). It messed me up and had to seek mental health services!! These people are evil!
Some one said in the forum that we can report to FBI , can some one tell me how to report to FBI ?

Be careful out there fellow redditors!
This guy in replying to is a known scammer. Do not engage.
Already did.
I can withdraw everything from my wallet and place it back without problems or enormous fees.
But like I said, it doesn't mean it is not a scam
We can always take advantage of it but creating multiple wallets to get the 88 USDT
Definitely scam
It‚Äôs easy, and important to report these crimes. Go to ic3.gov. Complete as much information as possible.
Doesn‚Äôt get my money back. I‚Äôm still on the pledge time. Can‚Äôt withdraw until pledge is over. It‚Äôs over in 5 days. Then I‚Äôll know if I can withdraw. But reading through the threads I think I‚Äôm F‚Äôed. I also took out a 50k loan too
Yes, the withdrawals are manually approved
I was never allowed to withdraw a penny of my 10,000 and neither was my friend.  Sadly, our accounts were deactivated once the scammers knew we figured them out, and we were blocked on social media.

To another scammer
Do you have a screenshot? What's the account? Please post the website
I check back in on it every so often but server keeps showing unavailable. Also I was invited into this group on WhatsApp called ‚ÄúDieter investment team‚Äù at first I was skeptical but it seemed that they were making good profits and calling profitable trades so I decided to join. Then all of a sudden they started talking about implementing a ‚Äúwhale‚Äù program but I didn‚Äôt have enough funds to be a part of it. It wasn‚Äôt until I tried withdrawing my money from tz coin that I was having issues. I contacted their support email and they responded to me (weren‚Äôt very helpful) and then the server suddenly shut down.
Just this week, its dawning on me really fast that I'm not getting my $83,000 back, let alone the (now looks to be fake) additional $140,000 in profits.    It sure looked like a legitimate trading site...   Fuck.

But you guys say this is a scam too.....  I even asked him for proof that it wasn't.   But my banker says don't do it.

Thank you.
I reported a scam locally to my local police department instead of the FBI.  Which might be a waste.  But I lost a lot of money... pretty much all of my BTC.  Ouch.  Not sure if I should also report it to the FBI.  The scammers were pretending to be law enforcement and running a recovery scam
Anybody got luck with FBI ?
That's indeed true.
I already knew this was some kind of scheme the moment the person contacted me out of nowhere.

Their systems won't be shut down for a long time because:
1 - all the URLs are located inside of ETH network
2 - all the URLs are different apps but look the same
3 - all the URLs were created in September 2022 and prior to that.
4 - A lot of addresses are inside of these apps that are constantly farming and taking money out like mine and others that think this is their way out of poverty.
5 - there are several mobile numbers related to these apps, some of them from UK and Germany (The person who contacted me has both) so I'm guessing this is not individual but a huge organisation/group.

If we look close enough to the front end code, we can see some logic flaws and a lot of Chinese comments about the code itself.

Something is weird here, that's for sure.
This is not an usual scam... However it might be, by the volume of some accounts, a Ponzi scheme or similar.

Yes, I have found out they call it the ""Pig Butchering scam"",  worked romance, friendship and then mentoring in trading on a site that looked legit, with trades that were increasingly profitable.   Or so I thought.   All fake, the trading site, the profits, the friendship, the romance.   And no way to get it the money back it looks like.  Probably converted through multiple crypto wallets and laundering etc.   I really could care less about the romance part of it really.
Update:

I managed to withdraw another 30$ from the pool.

Then i decided to felt for it and join the ""event"" they started it where, if you added 2000‚Ç¨/$ you would win 8 to 20 ETH.

Since i did not match that value, they said that i broke the contract so my USDT would be captive for 180 days.

Most likely lost the cash BUT we never know.

This might be a lie so im going to wait 6 days until the ""end"" of the event.
Oh crap. I‚Äôm so sorry. Feel free to dm me. These people need to be given a slow death. I hate every single

Polkadot i.e. DOT is a scam!!!!!!,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/x7hh7f/polkadot_ie_dot_is_a_scam/,"I wonder if this is true.
The Luna fiasco was a MASSIVE eye-opener for me. Too many crypto projects are just new-tech versions of the traditional banking ethos -- slick marketing to enable admins/execs to transfer wealth from the naive to themselves. I used to think of crypto as the people's financial revolution. But it's often even more predatory than trad-fin thanks to the dearth of consumer-protective legislation. Even worse, so many average people in crypto communities applaud exploitation and predation, emboldening swindlers. Human nature. Same ol' same ol'.
Did you give him some pussy though?
so hard for devs that they have the 2nd most DEV's in the entire space after Ethereum...it's also the most widely held asset by institutions...pretty sure you can confirm via Mesari reports.   plenty of people in the community can tell what's going on on-chain.

This is becoming the default behavior of too many small/new tech companies online. They allow their fan communities on social media to do their marketing for them while silencing or outright censoring raised concerns. Then the actual companies can attribute any behavior later judged unethical to bad actors not formally affiliated with the company. I think we're witnessing how revolutions so often lead to just more of the same old corruption."

I do not know solidity, I just have academic knowledge of C and some ""old"" language, but I was wondering how could one discover the scammer address just looking at the code? It never appears there.
The scam seems to be completed when the user use the function ""withdraw"". At that point the contract send its fund to the scammer address.

This should have so much more upvotes. People, you should understand this, if someone creates a bot that makes money, they will never EVER spend their time making youtube videos with explanations and helpful messages at all. They will be running their bot and living their lives. I am making a bot myself. For starters, there is no ""Amount per day"" at all. If you hear this, know that it is a scam. There may be averages or percentages per month or per year, there is no %100 guarantee, there are only safety nets and emergency pins that can prevent you from losing your money but that is it. If someone accepts a payment to make you a bot, don't do it. That means the developer itself doesn't believe the bot is going to make more than what you pay them. Don't think wishfully, think logically.

Total scam. I love when they pitch it as ""a thing you could only do if you were a developer"" as tho they're democritizing MEV Bots. Yea right. If they had a profitable bot they would milk it for the 2 weeks befor newer ones beat it. 

You can tell w/o having to check the code by just analyzing their language. They all talk the same, probably bc they're copypasta from an OG.
Learn to code in C and Solidity. Then learn how trading works on Ethereum. Could take you three months to a year, depending on how much time you allocate to it.
Yes. You cannot make $1,000 per day off 0.5-2 ETH. If you could, that knowledge would not be broadcast on YouTube where everyone would use it which would make it unprofitable within a day. If everyone is using a bot that uses the same method to frontrun transactions on Ethereum, then you're all competing with each other with no advantage over each other. This leads to a zero sum game.

fake comments. Basically Indians who sell their comments for $
yes that's an old codebase used in older MEV scam. Barely even bothered to modify it
*BEWARE* Nitro Nick or Nitro Nick eth or something using a mashup of those names. Found on fivver and then also pointed to his fb and youtube, all part of the scam to make it look legit
Good question. Solidity is very simple. If you studied C then you'd learn the basics of Sol in a day. Hit CMD + F (or whatever you use for ""search page"") in the smart contract *and* in every library in the smart contract (that's where they often hide them, ime) and search ""address"" or ""wallet"" or ""withdraw"" or etc. This will find the function containing their wallet address.
wouldn't trust it. The """"withdrawal"" function at the end does some funky stuff. It looks like the dev hid their wallet address within the code, encoded it, and then has the ""startExploration"" function unpack ""fetchMempoolData"" wherein the address appears to be hidden. Can't quite say but that was what I gleaned from a quick perusal. Always check the ""withdrawal"" function, if it looks weird then steer clear.
I fell for this :/ I feel so dumb rn.....

Be careful out there fellow redditors!
Can you demonstrate by reviewing the code that it is a scam?
Is there any way to find the parts in these codes where the scammer tries to trick you into giving them eth by using there own wallets to take the profits or withdraw functions at the end ect by replacing all of that comprimised code and replacing it with your own MM account numbers.  Basically taking their mev bot code they tried to scam you with, and making those necessary changes to it so that any and all eth on the source code gets sent to your own account instead? I tried asking chet gtp if certain codes on Github were scams and only like one was said to be legitimate but I still don't trust it. Thank you.
this looks like a scam as well
god damn this makes me wanna fucking cry but its what i get for not doing due diligence... this youtube video is looking like the same code as a few of the above comments; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhdrjOFT-E8&t=3s&ab\_channel=DavidWeb3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhdrjOFT-E8&t=3s&ab_channel=DavidWeb3)  
and i trusted it because my partner and i have been in a tight spot with money for a while now. 

ive since researched mevbotting and and the ethereum sandwiching trend a bit and see why this is harmful to the crypto community. im not seeking to build a mevbot at all now. just wanted to ask if you know what happens to the scammers once theyre flagged or if theres any way to get ethereum back from a contract you opened, lost ether to, then hit withdrawal on and closed.

i upvoted as well, youre super helpful. glad i didnt try again with an even bigger loss.

fucking scams
Damn sorry to hear that, mate. Did your ETH immediately get drained? We‚Äôre they able to drain any other tokens in your wallet?
yes, why? My point is that you don't need to always review the code. If you're going to do that then you might as well learn to code and make your own MEV because it will take you just as much time and you won't find a good MEV bot. If a good MEV bot exists for free, then it's already been made obsolete by everyone using it. That's how markets work. WAGMI isn't real in markets.
[removed]
the bots are specifically coded solely to transfer your money to another persons wallet.
no, there's no way really. if you didnt catch it immediately. Usually the scammer lets the eth sit for about 4 days before they transfer it. If its the same code, the scammers sent my eth to MEXC official exchange. i was able to track it using Arkham intelligence. As soon as i tracked the funds to MEXC which was instantly as i watched the wallet for 4 days, i had a bunch of friends and myself contact MEXC via twitter, MEXC froze the scammers wallet and gave me 7 days to go to the police, make a report and submit several documents explaining how the scammer got the funds and proving the funds came from my wallet. after i did all that MEXC sent the eth back to my wallet. i sent $1800, MEXC confiscated $1300 of my eth back so i lost $500 but without MEXC id of lost it all. Check the wallet, if your eth is still sitting in there keep watching it and waiting. As soon as it is move to a exchange immediately contact the exchange. about 30 of my friends on twitter tagged MEXC and the answered / froze the wallet within 3 mins. i cannot say enough good things about MEXC exchange for helping me get my money back.
I did this on a sub account of my Metamask, so no other Coins were drained luckily.... But the ETH are gone...   


I checked their ETH Adress on etherscan and they collected round about 15 ETH in a very short period of time...

I‚Äôve sold everything off of the only crypto that I had available, I will take into account a new gmail and phone number if I ever decide to pick it up again. So if I have no crypto available, the scammer should have nothing on me?

Thank you. Is there a real service out there
Have it off exchange completely, that should be helpful enough...i guess

Wdym have it off exchange??
Did you get money back
They are saying if you own Bitcoin for example, transfer it off the exchange (like Coinbase) and store it on a wallet like a Ledger hardware wallet where you control the private keys. It sounds like you already sold the crypto so sounds like their recommendation wouldn‚Äôt apply to you.

If someone has your email, main concern is phishing scams.  Secondary concern is someone trying to guess or reset your password to get into your account.

If someone has your phone number, main concern is a sim swap. Secondary concern is someone texting or calling you with scams.

What will most likely happen to you is a pig butchering scam or something similar. Look it up.

What will happen is they will let you withdraw a small amount at first to gain your trust, but after you will have put a lot more funds, you will try to withdraw your funds and you won't be able to.
Scam. Don't invest. If you can't find any info on this site, then it is most likely fraud. Check the url on whoisdog..com if the creation, update dates are recent and the url expires soon then its most likely scam.
Hey, I just got a random person that is telling me to reguster here and do stuff, obviously not going to do it, what did you heard about?
Im being asked to put money in this also. I put some in there and I‚Äôve made a couple of thousand. Has this been verified to be a scam?
Unfortunately, I did invest. In small increments I invested about $2200.  With trades I gained.....$229,000.  I thought I'd just let it ride and get more.  Not the case

First, they have to link wallet. I had to activate a link where they took a small fee out of my wallet. I thought that was it. Initially, customer service responded to my requests. Then I was told I had to perform ""asset verification"". That means I had to transfer from savings into my wallet in the form of USDT at least 10% of the amount I wanted (actually required to) withdraw. 

Bank stopped the transfer. Good me it's was part of a scam. The person who I was in contact with, basically holding hands for the investment, assured me my money was safe in my wallet. (in reading other scams on this subreddit I wonder...hmmm... If the linking process planted something to siphon out funds.

Upshot is that my funds in app.bitdogexltd.com remain frozen. Customer service's last communication was that I may lose my funds further if I don't act to verify and withdraw.  At least losing North of $2000 is better than losing over $23,000.

I did some checking. Bitdogex Foundation is based in Singapore.  Was incorporated in May 2021. Further search is that the company is GAZZETED TO BE STRUCK OFF.  I am assuming that they will no longer be allowed to operate, at least legally in Singapore.

I guess I need to thank the security division at my bank in cancelling my scheduled wire to my wallet

Anyone who has any questions can DM me. Maybe a class action lawsuit...

I have had a similar story with butdogeltd, but I only started with 100.  The person who brought me in kept pushing me to invest more, borrow from family/friends, and would try to claim my little 277 wasn't enough.  Somehow with the trading supernode, this ballooned to 94k.  I know.  What?!  So i tried to withdraw 3k,.. frozen.  Customer service claimedvi needed to pay 22% of the return, but out of pocket.  

I have never seen 94k i my life, but I also know crypto is considered property, and taxed as capital gains.  It would be reported on a 1099 etc.  So, yes.  It still definitely looks and feels like a scam.
I got scammed by a Chinese lady named Meiling in New York who instructed me to use [app.bitdogexltd.com](https://app.bitdogexltd.com) and trade my money there.  We did trade there at first and it was a success! I made lots of profits. She helped me withdraw a small amount at first which was a success but when I told her I would like to withdraw all of my money as she indicated that I could w/d any time any amount, she refused to help me and got mad at me. When I did it on my own because I wrote down her step-by-step instruction, my money was frozen. That was in March. I tried customer service to help me but it seems that customer service does not exist. it's just a display button that does not work. I can still log in to my account but I see my money is still frozen. My friends tell me it is a scam website.
They wanted me to. Fortunately, I want successful.
Yeah I'm not putting any money on this website, I just was wondering if anyone had seen it before. But yeah the customer service has bad English lol I will look up about the pig butchering scam...thank you.
If it's a ""random"" person telling you to use it, that's all you need to know. It's a fake!
Have you ever tried to take the money out?

Hi jimexr,
I just got slammed by bitdogexltd, could you please share how you were able to recover what you lost.  I would certainly appreciate the details in order for me to try and recover what I've lost $250K+.
It is a scam. I have lost money on the site in a similar way. The worst is my coinbase wallet was compromised and all my funds pulled out as well.
We‚Äôre you able to recovery anything? I fell for a similar scam
Thanks for the reply so I put in 5000 total and now I took out 7000 it was frozen for a few hour but now I have it back in my Coinbase. So It came out, I just don‚Äôt know if I should put it back in now? Edit for spelling errors
The user you replied to (u/jimexr) is a [recovery scammer](https://sites.google.com/view/scammerce/scams/recovery) and will only take more of your money. Please don't pay any more to these scammers.

Why would you ever do that ?  Sigh üòû- Do not trust anyone.  If you wanna date attractive Asian women there are zillions on regular dating sites - set up real life meeting and have fun.
The same thing happened to me but it was a guy, the name of their website was eth-bit.com.
They did the same to me,  it was horrible.  Lost about 90k. That with their program turn into 130k I decided to withdraw and then they told me I needed to pay 15k to withdraw,  in less than a few minutes my account was in 0.    This has been the most frustrated and sad thing ever.    Don‚Äôt understand how can they live with that.  She was also and Asian girl. That told
Me she will help me learn about crypto .  They use a program call CBO.
You have the wallet address?
I got hit by fxplunge.com for $480. Not a lot but I was weary to begin with. Fxmarketpundit is another one. Thankfully avoided any deposits on that one. Stay safe and with reputable wallets people
I was scammed by a Chinese girl. Apparently her name is Leah Wang. Website is six-swiss.com
Another scam site is defi-cloud.co through the coinbase wallet app. They will steal your money!
Also fell for this scam. Got tricked by a user called ""Collen (flower emoji)"" on whatsapp. Got scammed $3000. Please be careful if you see any asian girls or this name. Don't use the six-swisss website.  


Their plan was flawless and genius that they need to be stopped. See, most people tend to research like I did. I searched google for ""sixswiss"" and found nothing wrong. Because the company itself is actually legit. But what I didn't realize was she gave me a fake clone site.   
this clone site is also ABOVE the legit website in the search results (except google). Google seems to have removed them from their search engine. However they still show up on page one on bing, yahoo, duck duck, etc.

"stableone.io, stake matic and get 7% back",32,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/saekh5/stableoneio_stake_matic_and_get_7_back/,"[deleted]
well so far its paying out 7 percent every  morning i withdrawls and stake in binance for 11 percent. I'll be even in 9 days.
it worked for me to withdraw new matic ... not sure why I reinvested it but anyway, it did withdraw. I guess we won't know for 30 days if this is a rug or what, but for now it's producing matic that can be withdrawn ... not sure what's up
website is down
Anyone back in on this with V2 now out?
won't let me wd today stuck on ""please be patient and do not close this window until it finishes"" page
Why stableone why I can liquid stake MATIC for a high APR on a protocol like StaFi as well as rewarded rMATIC that are tradable while I stake?
lol i am telling people it is a scam
Hahaha, you folks made my evening.
okay........1.07 (7 per cent) to the power of 30 (30 days compounded) is 7.6. so 100 becomes 760 pounds?

Is this correct?
i was with you too on this now its down....is this the big down?
They stopped withdraw for two days now 10 days
sounds like a metamask problem.

are you on contract 1 or 2, and yes, this is still a scam even though some of us are making money
when you make a single reinvest to the contract you reset the 30 day counter.  


Also when you take profits 21 percent is auto added to your amount so the 7 percent keeps growing.  


Its a ponzi but if you get in early you its definatly worth it.
>They stopped withdraw for two days now 10 day

are the done now. did they just rug that shit?
lol yeah I'm still on V1 got my 10 days back out now trying for daily wd
this makes no sense, even for a ponzi scheme.

The calculator on the website also does not equate to 7 per cent a day

so on 100 pounds, and I withdraw 7 coins a day, what is the real rate of return?
They said they think it will be up for 7 months.
I will let you know in like 6 days.  I'm ahead.  I started with 500 matic.  I have about 1400 now with reinvest. I should be able to get out about 1000-1200$ in 6 days.  After that- its all gravy.  I have no idea how they make this work.  I guess as long as the market goes up- also you dont get your coins back- you get them back in earnings- so I assume they take the deposits- buy gold bullion and put it in a numbered swiss account- who knows what they do.  But so far it works.  I'm also in drip.  I put in 6-7 drip- about 1000.  I have pulled out about 2 drip- I should be even in   3 months.  I get about 12$ day.  If i got into it like an amway dealer- and got my upline and downline --I could make more- but I'm not into all that.  Thats what these guys on youtube do.  They get hundreds of people to sign up under them and they get like 1% on their deposits.  1% isn't much- but if you have 500 people- it adds up quickly.   the bigger issue is the scammers---there are so many scammers and metamask does nothing.  Its always ""you gave away your keys or seed phrase""  and they close the ticket. Completely worthless customer service.  

I can't speak to the stableone for longevity.  However- so far it seems to be working.  I wouldn't plan your childrens college educations or retirement on it- but if you can put in money and get it back---and then some- its as good or bad as anything else.  If you have any questions ask- I'm no expert but I am in it.
No it was an update
I don't know.

I find it an incredibly dishonest and confusing project
Okay I am having this problem on v1 too.

I emptied my account on version1, however there is 10 matic in there today?

It cannot be withdrawn for some reason.

However contract v2 is working
yeah therrs ore to it than that ... read whote paper
its down now
1.07 ( 7 per cent)

 to the power of 180 (180 days of 7 per cent added to the previous amount ) 

is 

194571
how do people get scammed into giving away their metamask? thanks for the leanthy reply. ill search for drip. im in [tokenminer.online](https://tokenminer.online) and stable. token gives you 3% forever?????? it used to be 460% in 3 months but its been up longer and i want to put 1000$ in stable buy its just too scary. but i dance with the idea everyday
how many have you seen so far rug pull
So if I invest say 500 I earn 7% a day correct?
How is this working out now? genuinely curious bc I was interested in stableone
Are you getting an error message?
Were you able to withdraw after first 10 days and then daily thereafter for 20 more days?
how did you empty your v1 account? is that what happens after 30 days on your last withdrawal?
i have read the white paper. it's total nonsense and secretive language
https://twitter.com/stableonematic/status/1490097398881964039?s=21
Yes they do that shit every time it‚Äôs withdrawal time
Now it‚Äôs up and want let me withdraw
I only ever tried contract 1 and could withdraw every 10 days
i have no idea - I can empty my v1 account once every 10 days.

After this, magically it keeps generating money.
Thanks for this
yeah its working now. thank god it didnt let me reinvest. i didnt want to but didnt see the opriton
I still can‚Äôt withdraw
that sucks man i was able to do it about 2 hours ago
Why is this saying withdraw error every time I try to withdraw
I just withdrew for the first time like 3 days ago. You may need to wait 10 more days? Idk what's the timer say
There is no timer right now
Yo WTF? Did you try to pull it all out? Any news? So is all your funds and account is missing? I recommend talk to them on Twitter they responded fast. Please keep me posted I'm very interested
It's it fixed?

Scammed to sign up with DiribitPRO trading portal,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/11ra8gw/scammed_to_sign_up_with_diribitpro_trading_portal/,"DeribitPRO is a fraudulent platform completely controlled by the scammer (this includes the customer service), trying to close your account won‚Äôt really do anything. The scammers have your tether and personal info so the harm is already done. If you sent tether to the scam platform from your Coinbase account by using a deposit address they provided you should be fine, but since you don‚Äôt know anything about crypto you should cash out whatever crypto you have left and close your account to be safe. Next time don‚Äôt take crypto investment advice from random people messaging you.
It's been several days since my original post alerted you of the fake DiribitPRO trading portal. I've received advice from those with good intentions, (thank you!) and yes of course, from the scammers, recovery gurus, crypto hackers themselves (which I had blocked). So here are my takeaways and lessons learned (albeit painful ones) to share: 

1. My money is gone and there is no way of getting it back. When I tried to withdraw it, the fake platform's customer service tried to get me to pay a fee to retrieve it (which I refused). 
2. I immediately took steps to secure my crypto accounts by alerting Coinbase and Binance of the situation and implementing additional security measures, such as moving my cryptos out to a different wallet, changing my email address, and enabling two-factor verifications. I wanted to take swift action to protect myself in the event of a security breach.
3. I filed a report with the FBI and sending them all screenshots of my interactions with the scammer and screenshots of the trading screens. This step is crucial in helping law enforcement agencies track down and apprehend cybercriminals. Also, it underscores the importance of reporting such incidents to the relevant authorities. 
4. Most importantly, don't click on any link provided to you by unknown individuals. Instead go to the website directly and carefully compare the URLs. The fake site has a similar URL with the official Diribit platform. My inner alarm should've gone up when the scammer insisted that I used the link she provided, increased the amount to trade (so I won't miss the 'wave'). Official trading platforms will not require you a minimum of $1,000 for trading. Any reputable broker will not require a minimum of $100,000 to get their advice (which thankfully, I didn't fall for it). 

Reading posts in this community saddened me as there are many scam victims. It is important to take action to prevent scammers (you know who you are!) from posting misleading messages and to share accurate information to help others. Yes, I was a victim of the fake DiribitPRO; but this incident has made me angry and more motivated to let others know of my experience so they can avoid being scammed. Peace out!

DeribitPro now uses additional new URLs: [deribitpros.com](https://deribitpros.com) (plural) and [deribitproi.com](https://deribitproi.com) \- it is the same portal, what is clear, since on the ""new site"" it is often not transformed from singular to plural. All sites uses the same links to not working apps.

You will loose your complete money if you invest here! 100% Scam platform!
In pretty sure I have the same one
OP, ignore recovery scammers like this one. Nobody can get your money back from the scammer if they don‚Äôt want to give it back to you.

Potential Luna 2.0 scam. Random coin appeared in my wallet. (LUNAV2.IO),32,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/v0r0qd/potential_luna_20_scam_random_coin_appeared_in_my/,"Called a dusting scam. Ignore it and leave alone!!!
This happened to me too and I posted about it 20 minutes after you did.. have no idea what it is or what's going on with it. I advise you to not touch it.. don't transfer your coins out of your wallet.. nothing.. until we get expert help. I say this because there may be a possibility that someone created a cryptocurrency with malicious code in it and anytime you choose to buy crypto or transfer it anywhere could be sent straight to them instead.. I'm not a cryptography expert but I am a coder who has created full scale websites.. and it's my opinion that's what they're trying to do.. any move you make could be a chance of emptying your wallet straight into theirs.. nothing has disappeared from my wallet by doing nothing.. so I believe it's safe by leaving it alone.. don't buy anything new.. don't sell.. again keep it as it is
Happened to me as well. Don‚Äôt know how it got to my wallet.

Eta: it‚Äôs an unverified token with no allowances
For the love of god everyone don‚Äôt go to the URL in the name of that token
[removed]
I also had this dusting scam placed in my Coinbase Wallet. I had a good amount of USDC in there which I transferred back to the Coinbase exchange with no issues. I believe like others have said, as long as you don‚Äôt interact with it you‚Äôll be fine.
[deleted]
I just left swiped it out of my wallet so i cant see it anymore. I think that deletes contract from wallet.
Sooooo... I tried to send it to 0x0 before I found this thread. Transaction didn't go through and it's still sitting there. I was able to send a couple of nfts to a different wallet but am concerned about some tokens I have staked through this wallet. Options??
Will it do anything if I continue to trade or try to transfer coins?
[removed]
Can you confirm that if it is hiddden and left alone that we can still deposit/withdraw other tokens in the wallet safely?
Totally legitimate. Definitely not a robbery.
[removed]
Just don‚Äôt touch it. Don‚Äôt swap it, don‚Äôt sell or anything. If you‚Äôre in trust wallet you can swipe on it and disable it. It‚Äôll always be on the blockchain so in your wallet but just ignore it forever. 

You can still use your wallet and trade. Just not that coin
They‚Äôre counting on you to try to swap it. Often you can only swap it on the scammers site, then they catch you in your moment of greed approving a contract to spend something other than that worthless token. As @cryptonb85 said ignore it. When you go on a block explorer in the future you‚Äôre going to see all kinds of junk in your wallet just ignore it. It‚Äôs not worth doing anything about.

Recovery scammer. Look at his comments. Its all the same copy and paste script leading to an IG recovery scammer
The danger is in contract interaction, not with tokens sitting in your wallet. Having a token in your wallet doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs compromised. You should be fine, just don‚Äôt touch the scam token. Or if you want to be safer, just send all the other tokens to an exchange , sell for bitcoin (or swap them for renbtc and release it to the bitcoin chain) ;) 
Just don‚Äôt touch that LUNAV2.IO token, it‚Äôs malicious
and why does it say in etherscan that it is a fake token? I also have high hopes that it is correct and legitimate
I am good i have done research and don't pay someone else to invest for me.
Thank you
Thank you
How does it get in there in the first place?

Be careful out there fellow redditors!
Appreciate that but this was a while ago when I was still learning a lot about crypto.. maybe 2 years in.. I've gotten  another since then and simply let it sit lol.. appreciate everyone's help
Scammer
It‚Äôs a transaction, source address their wallet, and they use multidestination and victims address is one of them. You don‚Äôt need to accept incoming transactions. You can verify this by looking on a block explorer. Enter your address, and find the transaction where they sent it to you.

Thats a recovery scammer btw. Look at his comment history. Its a scammer copy and paste script leading to an IG recovery scammer. Just letting you know
I‚Äôm so OCD. If I saw that in my wallet I‚Äôd have to get it out of there.
The one guy behind all these accounts must be a bit of a smooth brain eh üòÖ
Hes a scammer. Good catch
You can tell how much I cared about what he had to say lmao don't worry my guy the wallets I have may as well be non existent.. would never give anyone even a single character of anything I own.. thanks for looking out!
De nada. Just looking out and trying to keep everyone safe. They are despicable peddling their scams in this type of sub!
They are.. desperate little bottom feeders"

Ugghh. That sucks.  Another bad crypto investment bites the dust.
I‚Äôm sorry this has happened to you. You learn and you move on. 

Yo everyone else, you may have reasons to be lured by the sexy and seemingly lucrative complexity of arbitrage. Forget it. Actual arbitragers spend many waking hours trading, for small margins and have no reason to sell their services of small margin to others. Then there‚Äôs the danger of arbitrage, or even the fallibility of selling the entire market on profits of arbitrage. Recent example is $LUNA / $UST, whereby when UST was below a dollar (because supply was too high) and you sell it for $1 of LUNA. Each such trade netted you very little after trading fee but scale that up to hundreds of thousands. Well, look at the result. Whales saw a system built on hoping there wouldn‚Äôt be a back run and shorter their stablecoin. Ultimately, a necessary market action that would have happened sooner or later and weeds out ponzis.

People offering to make you X for an investment should be assumed to always be a lie. Simply buy and self custom bitcoin and you will sleep better at night
I ""invested"" $1000 on a crypto trading site. Turned the 1k into 65k in under a week trading usdt against bitcoin...now the sites customer chat and telegram are saying I need to pay them a fairly large fee about 3k.. To withdraw my 65k... pretty sure it's all fake and a scam but if anyone can confirm I'd love to know cause 65k is life changing to me right now is it common practice for trading sites to require a fee before they release funds or is that just scam city????  any trading experts know if trading USDT against BTC can even produce that kind of profit in a week..?  All seems to good to be true.
Recovery scammer.
You are a recovery scammer.
more like crypto gamble lol.

I have some money with cotps just in case it actually works out but I 98.5% expect to lose it. was just hoping to maybe get lucky and get some money out of it before they rug pull.
Yes, gamble! 
Just like my Strongblock gamble.
I‚Äôm tempted to remove this comment, but the project isn‚Äôt an intentional scam, but by transitive properties of shitcoins, i highly recommend considering this a no go. I‚Äôll confess I made money on it, but I fully treated it as I put a bunch of money on 6 & 8 in craps at the casino expecting to eventually lose it. I simply got lucky. DO NOT enter into anything because some others got lucky."

Front running bot scam,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/rq3tuf/front_running_bot_scam/,"Need to post this in larger subs such as cryptocurrency. Sadly they will remove it! Which is pretty freaking weird!
Folks should ask remix to put up some kind of warning about this scam.
Sadly this happened to my husband and I am here researching trying to figure out if it happened to any others. He got scammed out of about $600. Sad. This is why YouTube should allow users to see dislikes. It would have appeared fishy if it had a low dislike count or if likes and dislikes were restricted altogether by the creator. It appeared fishy to me anyways when he told me about it, but oh well. Is there nothing that can be done to get the money back? I know absolutely nothing about crypto. It‚Äôs my husband who dabbles in crypto.
Yeah. I fell for it too. One bnb.
They did :(
I am sorry it happened to your husband. I agree on the YouTube thing. It would help. Sadly I doubt anything can be done to get the money back. You could [report](https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/) the address to which the money is being sent but that doesn't help much. The scammer can simply send the money to another address. Which is what they have done.  Maybe one could report to Binance but with the sums of money involved in the scam I doubt they would care, but I don't know.  The scammer has scammed around $4000 from various folk.
I am sorry.
Thanks for the response. I'm going to forward my husband this info. At least maybe he can report the address where the money was sent as you said. He said it was convincing because on the video he watched there were many comments and responses verifying the process. A lengthy scam to set up but apparently worth it for the scammer. Thanks for the info again and for trying to spread the word. Maybe others will avoid the misfortune of this scam.
You are welcome. I hope so too. I tried reporting the address but I failed since they were asking for a picture showing evidence of the scam.  All I have was the evidence on the block explorer and they don't want that. Anyway, I reported the video on YouTube. Hopefully, more people report it, that could help. The scammers are pretty crafty though, they'll create another account and run the scam again. It is hard to keep up with them. I've come across a number of those videos. One was about flash loans, another about arbitrage, and now this one about front running. It is simply the same scam. Some accounts even have over 20K subscribers but only started a couple of weeks back. On the surface, it looks legit. I hope people can check Reddit before trying the videos.
hi, i am a victim as well, any updates regarding recovering your husband loss? Thanks"
