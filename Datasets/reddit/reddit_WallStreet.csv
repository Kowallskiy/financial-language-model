Inside in Nok and BB.
Now waiting🤔
This morning, at around 3am cst, NOK was buyable on Robinhood. I get a notification this morning at 8:45 that NOK is now an unsupported stock in Robinhood and that my order of over 30 shares was canceled. Interesting stuff.
Too funny how they are trying to stop us with various tactics - look at all the meme stock prices this morning - they're just making it easier for us to all Grab em!
Let’s drive Nok up man
wallstreet wants to scare you into selling your NOKIA so the men in suits can make money off the shorts. Don't sell
It's only gonna grow! Just hold and you will be grateful you did.
How about SNDL
Funny how everyone said that NOK was a ploy by wall street bots to distract from GME, but it still got shut down!
Let's goooo!!!
Go go go

  Levi & Korsinsky, LLP, a national securities law firm that has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors, announces that it has commenced an investigation against Robinhood and other popular retail trading platforms on behalf of investors who invested or were prevented from investing in GME and other stocks pursuant to trading bans on these stocks.

I know this sub hates XSPA for it's past antics, justifiably so.  But it hit rock bottom at 1.18 just 3 weeks ago, and has organically recovered to about 2.28 before all of the craziness this week started adding to the volatility.  It's an incredibly highly shorted stock, with nothing but good news for weeks now, new locations, partnerships etc.  It's a solid target for punishing shorts, decent stock with the potential of an actual future.  It doesn't have the nostalgia that GameStop or Nokia do, but it's already up .40 in pre-market and just this morning with very little momentum was able to squeeze to 3.70.  I think we may see that strategy repeat today or next week, combined with natural growth.  It won't go parabolic like GME did, but gains are gains.  I'm all for it.
Europese market
Let's do it show em what we can do together.
We should hold onto AMC and demand they show the old Plant of the Apes movies to celebrate keeping the stock alive

You realize you’re going to need a market cap of 128 billion for a $1? This money would make a lot of people rich if put into coins without a massive circulating supply. 
This is literally the dumbest thing in crypto I have ever witnessed lol.
I don’t have that much to work with but I respect the hustle
Shittt, I submitted an application ages ago and they didn’t accept it
I think you missed the joke. Dogecoin is measured in millionths. That's so many points on the basis that it is incredibly unlikely to shift 1 million points on the ""dollar"".
What a tiny bag to hold.
.08 even. I am impressed and disturbed. A joke coin is ""gaining value"".

Well damn. I think we're onto something my fellow seasoned investors. Let's do a thing.
The've already reversed position and allowed limited trading today. There is alot of pressure on them if they dont allow full trading Robinhood is done. In my opinion they will open it fully next week especially on a stock like nokia which is a real business making revenue and money.
Buy!! At the current price you are never going to lose. Only upside for NOK from here.
Aight, got to 20. Dumping my ETF holdings for NOK.

I just love NOK stock.. and plan to buy more.
I have a few hundred in and loosing half.. Would love for it to go back up.. Never did after all the drama
Wish it would stop dropping was moving nice this morning
Ahahahaha!
I don't disagree at all.
I think a lot of us already whent.
I posted a snippet of some data in this subreddit. I really think Nokia is a fairly good one in general.
Oh I went full NOK.
I’m in 5K NOK let’s gooo🚀
Or just a bunch of people spending like $20 🤷‍♂️.

Let's be real, this sub is far less extensive than WSB.
I clearly need to learn a lot more.
Robin Hood can catch these 👐
Nice! Go big or go home!
Fucking agree 100%
What?!
Bought both I see
I mean, they do have a contract with NASA to put 5G on the moon.
Get rid of that app. Go to a broker that isn’t obviously corrupt. They make money off of you trading and they don't deserve a single red cent.
Meh 🤷‍♂️ i figure I hold onto stocks anyway. The other one I hold is LXRX which is a grossly undervalued pharmaceutical company that just got approved for phase 3 trials on a diabetic medication. Buy and hold.
Shit, does this mean I cash in my non-existent 401k?
not enough..... we need to get teh WSB group on this! Time to let go for GME and AMC!
Everyone needs to be on the same page and just buy one thing and then everybody makes out😄
The other brokers that did the same too!
It was a game on Nokia Phones in 90’s
I agree hopefully it will encourage people to buy into it because of the decrease . I think it will be a huge success in Asia , going to hold also . That’s actually in my range I appreciate the tip that would be great if they continue success .
How the hell do I get into WSB?
I just bought with the intention of holding. I actually did some homework before posting this and think the NOK has some potential.
I was joking. Fucken forgot about playing that game.
No probs dude. Stocks are fun and a good way to save for the future. I'm hoping that what comes out of this shit-show is that more little guys are interested in saving and investing in a serious manner.

"Another biggest short float company, Macerich Company (MAC)",246,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreet/comments/l5ea1b/another_biggest_short_float_company_macerich/,"🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀I'm holding 150K shares of MAC with my 💎✋. I've been holding since roughly $9.00/share, to give you an idea of how much confidence I have in it.

I've done a \*ton\* of DD on this company along with a friend. Reviewed every quarterly report, earnings call ... been going to their malls in a number of states, etc ...

The summary is: The company was underpriced before covid, because ""Retail is dead"", and 🏳️‍🌈🐻 short sellers were pricing it for bankruptcy. In reality: The malls are busy, and the banks have no interest in foreclosing since the loans are non-recourse. Revenue per square foot is already at 90% of pre-covid levels, occupancy is at 94%, and any vacancies that opened up were quickly replaced. The dividend will almost certainly be recovered to normal (4X current levels) within the next year or two, which gives it one of the best dividends available in the market today.

There is 70% short interest, 93% is held by institutions and 7% by insiders. Put in other words, when a squeeze happens, there are basically no available shares.

I don't know about GME, and I wish you guys luck on that -- I haven't done DD on it -- but I can tell you that MAC should be worth at least $40-60/share in a year, and even $100-150 is a reasonable valuation. But, given the possibility of a monstrous short squeeze, this could easily pop MUCH higher than $150 in the short term.
They tried to take us under $20 today. Hold and we will kill all the shorts
Mac has some real potential. It's gone up a lot. Could easily be another short  squeeze. In general this should be a $60 stock. It will have a .71 cent dividend in a few months. That's more than T's divident and T is at $30.  I bought in today. Make sure not to go all in. A 20% risk is good.
I am holding some shares and set up limit sell at $150
I am long MAC.  MAC to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 
💎✋ over here
185 shares lesssgooooo
MAC will survive and the competition will not. MAC owns mostly Class A malls. This has been shorted down below fair value for years! Lets fix this injustice!
Morningstar published a piece saying Macerich is the most undervalued company with a high short interest

https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1019271/crowd-sourcing-a-short-squeeze
I agree I have already been in Mac, I load when it dips bc of dividends. It a perfect stock.
[deleted]
 I am long MAC. MAC to the moon!
The thing about MAC is it is still undervalued. Fair value is $40 based on dividend potential.
Mac to the moon 🌙 🚀🍔
I‘ve joined from Germany... happy MAC & cheese everyone
MAC does look like a potential n'other GME. It has had to reduce its dividend due to COVID downturn like many REITs from $2.80 annual to currently 60c but it is rising again. After vaccination gets us back to normal business MAC should be back to normal. Meanwhile it's trading not too far above Book so it's a stock that I might want to have anyway. So the 58% short interest seems excessive. Note 58m shares traded today though, 12 x normal volume! Makes me wonder if that's shorts covering already in anticipation of a long attack? I think it is worth buying some cheap high strike leaps to see what happens.
I've been in MAC since something absurd like $5. I have been to some of their malls, and they are FANCY. Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple are some of their clients. It's a solid company and extremely undervalued. Let's blow it up.
Mac to the moon!!  I bet it’ll be a $100 per share by next week!!!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
MAC Macerich is the next best short squeeze play. It is the 4th most shorted stock in the market with solid fundamentals and decent dividends. The most important, shorts haven't started to cover so we got tons of room to run.
I’m in! 857 shares at $22.75 LETS GO! 🚀🚀🚀🌑🌑🌑
still long MAC 🚀🚀🚀
I am getting ready to reload my long position. Sold out at $21. $18. is looking good. This mall REIT will survive and thrive.
In with 5k shares, hold till moon!
come on MAC 60$ 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
MAC to the moon. Easy 51$ intrinsic value. This is the best stock in the market Deep Stonking Value!!! 510$ Squeeze potential. Serves the shorts who shorted below 8$ right
Just bought MAC

&#x200B;

To the moon guys
Long MAC let’s send it to the 🚀🚀🚀🌚 this company has some good real estate!
Question: so, I'm long MAC, but I was in before the crash in March 2020.  I'm surprised by the spike in price and just sort of delighted to be along for the ride.  However, there have been some comments on intrinsic value in the thread.  MorningStar's estimate of value is above 30 per share, but CRFA says its maybe a 6 dollar stock.  Can anybody explain why the opinions differ between the two analysts?  Anyhow, as you say, ""to the moon!""
I’m looooong! Target $100! And diamond hands!
This one will be amazing!!! Let’s get this to $100 EOW!!! We can do it!!! Yolo

LET'S GO MAC 🚀🚀🚀 Let's bring this to the moooooon!
 currently own 10k shares with a strategy to buy 5k more up or down from these levels and trying to decide which far out of the money calls are the best to purchase for ""group"" gamma squeeze. any advice from options expert on this board? thank you in advance!
thankfully, IAB RH and others have not blocked buying new shares of MAC yet...
I am holding gme forever and I just bought Mac and will hold until $50 cuz Mac is def worth $50 what’s wrong with making a 2-3 bagger not gme but still a great stock idea thanks for the tip looks like a no brainer for a retard like me
The strong balance sheet will make them survive pandemic and 2022 redevelop for google project. I read the earning reports base on fact.
Upvote my post and share it with your friend and GME army , I hold both with my diamond hands , GME can go $200 easily , another 15 days of short squeeze before short interest update. MAC still haven't squeeze these short sellers yet. Ride or die.
Macerichhh going to the mooooooonn 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌔🌔🌔🌔🌔🌔
Deep Value + squeeze potential + dividends being paid, where do you find such a good combo?
I get mac cheese
It's happening!!!!!
MAC GOING TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌔 COME TOGETHER
I am holding strong my 11k shares to $150!
Another holding MAC to the mooon. This time they gonna lose!
I'm holding!  Friday should be a positive dividend announcement!
Weird! My big Mac position was up about $65k this early am, now about zip- real rollercoaster. My other shortbuster, LUMN did much better- up about 14% earlier today, now about half that. LUMN is 9 days to cover, profitable, about 7% dividend while u wait, telecom 5G play, thousands of miles of optical fiber here and overseas. I'm up 39% since Friday.
Let's Go, Added
Hold the line we will win this big,  they need to taste their own medicine.
Long Mac! 150 shares. They even pay a dividend :)
MAC exactly the same pattern as GMT 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Solid company. How can anyone short this one is beyond me.

Guys HODL! RH hasn't even banned MAC. Hence, we aren't a meme stock? 😂
Holding strong 💪 down 30% but I’m a believer
Agree! Also long with MAC and also BB
Ok I am holding it till $80
Investors Business Daily highlights MAC as one of the stocks with the highest amount of short  shares in today's article about GME.
I smell blood.  Hedge funds going under.  Love taking your money.
According to the ""short interest ratio"" (which is the days it would take for all shorts to cover at an average volume day), MAC (15) is MUCH higher than GME (6) or BBBY (11). 

This means that, compared to trading float and volume, MAC would have a much bigger price surge with any successful short squeeze than the others. Furthermore, for what it is worth, MAC is a solid company with decent book value. 

[https://shortvolume.com/](https://shortvolume.com/)
yes...MAC is a real good bet...great properties...good management...
How risky is the play? 
How foolish would it be to buy 1,000 shares?
Macerich is making me some serious 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The stock is good.

I got in at 9 - now at 20.

Canadian pension fund sold it though. Big amounts at 20.

History of the stock is that
2007 was at 100
2008 dropped to 11
2015 came back up to 70
2020 covid made it drop to 5
2021 buyers come in and shoot it up to 20

Now, what is the future?
Since 2016 - it has made negative sales growth.
A company that pays income tax is good. More income tax - better. In 2019, they paid 1.59 M to the govt. Showing EPS growth of 19% in 2019 as well! (yay!) Out of last 4 years - it has not grown EPS only once (excl 2020) It has 5.6 B of debt - in a money printing world that is simply awesome.
If it hits EPS of 1 USD like in 2019 - then we will be rich. 2020 did not look great from this pov, but malls are opening back up and where will rich people shop - you got it right.

Buy around 15 USD and sit tight. Wall street might try to pull down this one. We should sell north of 30. Patience will pay in this stock.

I got in at 9 - it dropped to 7 and 6. I was cursing myself. And now it is at 20. So, I am happy.

Would warn you not to buy right now- because it seems some big fish is trying to kill the price (maybe the Canadian fund).
MAC's effective float is narrower than declared due to high institutional ownership (93%) and 7% insiders shares. If everyone sits tight on their positions, it certainly explodes.
SQUEEZE THAT LEMON (MACERICH) TIL THE JUICE RUNS DOWN OUR LEGS!!!!!!!!!!
 This willto the 🌙🌚!!! Big - MAC .... All day.

I truly believe the fair value of this stock should be more than $60 at least. With the squeeze, sky is the limit.
TODAY MACERICHHH!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🍔
AUTIST REPORTING FOR DUTY
one addition is that the short rate declared belongs to 1/15 and I am pretty sure the short rate is increased within this week to stabilize the price. Holders of this stock are not the traders such as Ontario Teacher Pension Plan and other institutions and they own 93% of the float. If you do not sell, 80M shorted stocks means a lot for such a stable and profitable A class company. Think twice...
United we stand together we fight
This is a real company with real assets and it pays a decent dividend albeit one that may be shaky given the amount of debt on the balance sheet.  It is a beaten down stock because of general retail anxiety over Covid 19.  Apparently, Citigroup put out a sell recommendation on the stock in mid-December 2020 because the company has a lot of debt which will need to be refinanced soon.  Morgan Stanley put out the equivalent of a sell on the stock last fall as reported by Barron’s.     This company is the third largest U.S. operator of upscale malls in affluent areas.  Citigroup has a price target at $9.50 which is half of the current market value.  The real question is whether the extremely short float is warranted or, instead, there is real value here.  Whether this stock ends up in a short squeeze remains to be seen.  Surely, this one is a speculative endeavor no matter which side of a trade you are on.
 MAC short interest decreased by only 3% to 57% . The shorts won a battle yesterday, but this war is far from over.  🚀  💎
still holding 💎💎💎💎✋✋✋✋
Is it going to go up? Should i buy lat $20?
I am all in MAC
Hold!
Just bought some mac 😈 good luck
Can we all open up this discussion about MAC again today now that the teachers union has sold. If you look at my comment history you can see I have a leap been very pro MAC - 200 shares currently at $14.90 average, I’ve been averaging up.

What’s the future look like here?
Why isn’t this short interest more publicly talked about?
Guys let’s take MAC to the moon
Can someone post this to front page of WSB?
Couldn’t agree more. MAC needs to squeeze!
I am long MAC as well.  Assets held provide a great base value and with 58% short plenty of upside.  Raise of dividend coming whether this quarter or next is the question.
I’m in Mac too....
Real short ratio compared to float is more than 90%. 3$ dividend potential with strong fundamentals.  revanchist psychology of the human for post covid condition. Needs to fly to moon...
hey you are right the book price on this stock is 17.43
On board with this
Like I said, the earning of Q4 2021 which is on Feb will bring positive news and one more refinance news will bring the number higher.
easy 50$
long 10K shares.
Yes, I am holding all my shares!
up almost 40% this week and its only tuesday!

Blackrock added 3M shares today, reaching up 21M shares on MAC.
Looks like a winner
Might be a bot might be someone coming here after  being of Twitter for a while for example. The thesis is at least decent if not very good. That's why personally am 80% in MAC 20% in SPG.
Bought MAC at $8. Short squeeze is coming
I'm in!!!
Buy yourself a big MAC🍔 and go to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Dividend announcement coming soon and earnings February 11, big MAC 🍔 is hugely undervalued and has massive short, get ready for the short squeeze 🚀🚀🚀🚀
It would take 15 days of average volume for the shorts to cover their positions. That is higher than GME. Buy MAC, hold and don't lend your position. The shorts will have very limited options.
LEGIT DD FOR MACERICH (MAC)

https://youtu.be/54d4AcdADSo
Folks, JP Morgan was fined doing some crazy s in this stock way back in 2010. It was time after the GFC crisis.     
They keep violating Rule 105 of Regulation M - and they keep killing the small invstor like me. 
Now, I own MAC from 9 USD + I am NOT selling it.

They first short sell it and then while raising equity from market get it cheaper! How sick is that! Read for yourself below.

From SEC website: 
""On April 12, 2010 and April 14, 2010, JPMIM sold short a total of 20,700 shares of The Macerich Company (“MAC”) during the restricted period at an average price of $42.3662 per share. On April 15, 2010, MAC priced a follow-on offering of its common stock at $41 per share. JPMIM received an allocation that included 28,330 shares in that offering. The difference between
JPMIM’s proceeds received from the restricted period short sales of MAC shares and the price paid for 20,700 shares received in the offering was $28,280.34. Thus, JPMIM’s participation in 
the 2010 MAC offering resulted in total profits of $28,280.34.""

as MAC stock goes higher there will be forced buyers of MAC as it is part of the S&P 500 index. Buy otm calls which will force market makers to buy the stock. Short interest is at 70%. We have all the rocket fuel we need, lfg to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
MAcerich management needs to use some of the $500M cash on hand to buy the stock at below book value and thus cause a short squeeze to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
$MAC longs, email the MAC IR department and tell MGMT to buy back their shares. MAC has $500M in the bank and plenty of firepower to fight the shorts and trigger a short squeeze to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
How the heck are the shares being sold down. WE NEED MORE VISIBILITY AND PEOPLE TO BLOW THE FUNDS OUT OF THE WATER!
MAC is a great short squeeze.  The short holders have to pay the dividend, so even more pain for short holders.  MAC goes ex-dividend on Feb 18
I'm in from Italy ale
Long MAC all day! Retail sales per square foot are basically back to pre-COVID levels even during a pandemic. Sales per square foot were growing every year pre-COVID and they own the highest quality malls in the country!
High end Class A malls. Retail sales 90% of pre-Covid. Long to $50
WHy not post in WSB ?
I actually see a lot of potential in the underlying company. Seems like a no brainer given the high number of short sellers out there
I have had my account and Mac position for almost a year.  This one will go way up, short squeeze or no.  Look at chart around the great recession. I rest my case.
MAC has even better squeeze potential than GME!
Long Mac, wait til it resume previous dividend level or hit 80$
OMG it‘s the best board ever
I AM IN!
Great reit, to the moon  🚀
LFG MAC NO ONE SELL.  CAN GO TO $200 if anything like GME/AMC!!
MOOOOON
I was up 25% plus today on MAC- 70% short- many naked according to seeking alpha. Some of the shorties seem to be bailing today, now around 18%. Crazy trading. Still way below net asset value. Would be a double to fair value even without a squeeze!

Go for it!
For top 10 mostly shorted stocks, I think MAC is the only stock that is profitable and paying dividend.
I'm in let's roll
58% short interest 🙂
Hedgies gonna die
Mac to the moooooon🌜
i've been in on this (MAC) for the past two weeks. longs away, spread the word and crush those shorts.
just in 10k stocks, long for yearrr
58% short ... Looks like th company is sound .. it pays a dividend ... buy/squeeze
BUYBUY :D
I'm all in on this dip, it definitely will go back up
TD has sent out another statement that certain stocks only certain amounts and margins will be released?!!! They are trying to prevent this from happening. Do your best to continue to buy what you want so shorts can’t borrow

LONG LIVE MAC(ERICH) 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🔥
I'm cautiously bullish. 

Fundamentals are sound but I'm afraid that the shorts on this one will win out everyday AH. 15 days to cover so they have plenty of room to conduct such manipulation.
if you are paperhanded like me, the strategy on MAC is to buy it aftermarket at the low and sell it premarket at the high until MAC lands at a price that you feel is fair
Are my $30c 2/19 fuked? Lmao
What about amc stock?
All in 🚀🚀🚀
Its short float dropped to 53%... Is it still worth buying? 

What if those institutions sell their holdings when the price goes too high, just as the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan did?
MAC in a great position to buy now.  Short interest will break the shorts over the coming weeks. this is a legit company with a nice yield.  Long and strong. Easy money at this price.  Hedgies will be leaping out of skyscrapers when the turn arrives soon.
 [https://youtu.be/\_DnLaAMWVEw](https://youtu.be/_DnLaAMWVEw)
Let’s see what happens this week with MAC, my guess is by 2/5 your only allowed to buy 1 share across multiple platforms.
MAC TO THE MF MOON LFG
Absolutely! massive squeeze incoming and this is also a great company, not like GME that is not profitable
Hey guys, I wanted to know where you can best find out where the next investment will be and where it is discussed most.  thanks🙃
Mac is definitely deserve to come back after the wall street has short selling it. And they need to taste their own medicine.
Hold tight fellas, shorties haven't started squeezed out yet, they still placing double bet down.
Swi... 16% short interest
Agreed
GME, MAC,BB, LUMN will moon,  trust it or not.  I am holding all of them with my diamond hands.
For those dont believe about it,  its ok you may wanna buy later on just like GME, you may still buying tmr after GME at high valuation since mac is incredibly cheap now.  You miss the ride,  not my fault.  I am long on $GME, $MAC, $BB, $LUMN. Good luck for those who hold and you will thank me later.  You cant be happier when $Mac and $LUMN starting short squeeze.

MAC up 40 cents at the moment.  If it closes around here their margin call 0ver the weekend is .40 cents times 80 million shares.  Now we are talking real money. By the 18th Feb. they have to come up with .15 cents times 80 million. No exception money needs to be posted in accounts. Don’t have it tough luck. Firms are mandated to cover their margin short.. Hedgies feeling the heat. Looks like a no brainer to me.
... Encavis (WKN 609500). Ironically, a value from the renewable energies sector is the most strongly short-sold share in Germany. According to the Federal Gazette, 13.35 percent of all shares in Encavis are currently sold short by hedge funds, and this proportion is not higher for any other German shares. The Federal Gazette only lists items that are greater than 0.5 percent. In fact, many more Encavis shares are likely to be short.
Sure, but first: GME.
Ibio has been heavily shorted for 5 years, its a company that makes plant based vaccines and they were created by BARDA and DARPA (federal funding) for mass production of vaccines, they have 2 coronavirus vaccines in the pipeline and multiple other products, they have contracts for growing protein for multiple companies and have very little debt, cash on hand, new ceo coo, cfo, cso, and board members, a deal with IBM for free IBM Watson support to perfect their coronavirus drugs. This company is hiring like crazy and is heavily followed on stocktwits with 90,000 (who call themselves the ibio cult)followers, 3 seperate Facebook groups and has great volume at about 20 mil, they also were added to Russell 2000 & 3000 last year(so even more eyes), small market cap company with a ton of interest in following.  I've seen short volume as high as 50 - 60%, sometimes there no shares left to short. Its currently $1.72 & ripped to $7.45 last July on news, all speculation. Just had an analyst update the SP $3 but struggling to move up because of shorts.The higher it goes, the more shorties jump in, could make some serious money, please check it out and see what you think, spread the word, after AMC, its iBio time![fintel short volume ](https://fintel.io/ss/us/ibio)

 GameStop is going through a monumental short squeeze.

* We think that its landlord, Macerich, is poised for a similar short squeeze.
* MAC  offers significant upside potential but with much better downside  protection. For this reason, we believe that it is your next best short  squeeze investment opportunity.

You cannot stop your broker lending stock to shorts if you have net margin borrowings. To stop lending,  either pay off margin borrowing ( which you could do by selling puts or covered calls or both)  or hold the stock in an IRA  or transfer it to a non-margin (cash) account.

Great link, good reading.  Long MAC 🚀
Love the research brother. Bought a bunch of MAC at $10, was planning on long hold but honestly if it gets to $30 ish real quick, might jump out. Otherwise might have to wait a long while. Your thoughts? A 40+ run would be amazing, but who knows.

Sit tight and hold for the short squeeze to come, share with WSB folks
Certainly GME, AMC, KOSS, BBBY and others are way overpriced based on a reasonable company valuation. If MAC shoots up 1,000+% percent like them, then it will be overvalued as well. The difference is that MAC probably is worth more than the present price, and perhaps equally important in this revolutionary-like environment, the short-squeeze potential is at least as big due to the high Short Interest Ratio.

People keep referencing numbers like that percentage of float that is shorted, but that is probably not the best number to look at. A better number is the days it would take for shorts to cover their position at average daily volumes (Short Interest Ratio, aka Days to Cover). As of yesterday, MAC was at about 15, GME 6, and AMC under 2. Considering the massive volume of trades the last couple days for GME and AMC, I think their squeeze is about over. MAC could, in theory, still pop many-fold.
Screw them they just try to play short in this,  before short squeeze $35 after short squeeze $100
Support and long.
Welcome!
Imo depends on how long you plan to hold your shares. I don't know anything about calls. But I'm holding 180,000 shares at $8.71 for the long term (squeeze or not), for increased dividends and appreciation.
LONG MAC
Thanks for the support. Bring the army over.
Yep, that's what I've got,  today for $1, 4K

This is a real bummer though. But hopefully the market catches on to MAC soon!
Great information. I started accumulating late last year at $7.71 (And averaged up to $8.71), it then went down and held. Very happy where we are now, regardless of the turbulence last 2 days. 

Many ways for the long term investor to play this, collect dividends until the inevitable price and yield increase. However for those that got in low (below $10), would be hard to give up a juicy dividend once restored.
Yes thats why we are trying to short squeeze.
Yes we all are.
52% short share on this company is just absurd.
I agree with most of what you are saying. Not sure I would classify the current $0.15 a share dividend as shaky, the old $0.75- definitely.
Much of the debt is non-recourse. Takes forever to workout and the servicer isn't tied to the bank holding the note and gets paid the longer it takes to service. Terrible alignment of incentives. 

All 2020 I've been slogging through trying to purchase hotels that are hurting and these loans are a nightmare to wipe. Banks (in my projects) have across the board opted to hold on instead of walk, and that's for hotels, not properties with the likes of Apple and Microsoft as tenants. I'm not too worried about the debt situation in this climate, given the alternatives someone will come in and offer a refi, just look at $AMC. There's not a lot of places to go if your business is money lending.   


I jumped in at $22 and am doubling down at current levels.
Diamond hands with you brother!
Use 5% fund to buy on every 5-10% dip,  use 20% fund to buy@ 10-11, then 60 % fund buy on Support is $7- 8 if it goes that low but highly doubt it.
[removed]
Definitely! Not selling for pennies when we can make dollars.
Good luck!
My account still news to post wsb,  anyone can spread the word join us in r/macarmybets
The FLOAT % is 80%+, not 50. This thing is going to SKYROCKET once they find this one.
The book value of MAC is understated in my opinion.  Depreciation and amortization expense since the real estate was acquired is deduced from their capital account (and most people know that RE values go up each year as cash flows increase).  In addition, low refinancing of mortgages will allow MACs cash flow to go up even more.

I am long MAC when I researched the stock and felt it was highly undervalued amid a Covid recovery and a significant increase in the dividend over the next year or so.
Cux blackrock had been accumulated the stock since march to borrow to the short sellers,  we are here to squeeze the short now.
They neex to pay up and taste their own med.
Good find, didn't know this. Thank you.
They dont let me since my account still new,  help me to send my words there.
Thanks for stay long and support. We will win big.
Why?
After the $GME games maybe they'll have to tread more lightly. Many have posted saying set your sell limits far about the price (say $250) so that the brokers are not permitted to lend the shares. I have, however, heard from broker buddies that this has not stopped them in the past even though open order should preclude them. But, given the scrutiny they are receiving and likely will continue to receive I think this has a good chance of establishing an uptrend. Depending on how the $GME stories progress everyone on the other side might just say screw this and let it run.
Gtfo we dont sell
We arent paper hands,  we freaking holddddddd
If wsb army join us you will be rich af.
Hard to predict , their price pop mainly cuz by wsb as 2nd target,  if mac is wsbs target,  we already hit the moon
If we all buy them up and hold, the shorts technically won't have enough shares to borrow to cover haha. Normal to expect some selling pressure on the way up but everyone just has to go hard on MAC!!!
Real float is 91.5M and 78.5M of it shorted.
Pushhhhhhhh
Any price target under $35 is a buy til the short squeeze happen, this will get to $50 in no time when that happen.
Lets go.
I am hold with my diamond hands , no short get my shares. Screw them shorts.
Yeah long call will be a low risk high reward play.
Yes they are,  recovery play,  and they start paying off the note and debt this year as well.  If management knows that they are sitting in the gold and use it properly,  the price will bounce back.
Supporting,  long mac and let them recover.
OP has a brand new account, and all posts so far have been the exact same thing. I think this is one of those bs accounts that is trying to divert attention (and money) from GME.
Citron also shorted an up and coming  EV stock, NIO. NIO short squeeze???
This needs to be front page!
Lol do your own research by reading th earning report of MAC and wait for a Q4 2020, and Q1 2021, you will see this is not hype.  This is undervalue.
Hedge fund buying cheap shares from MAC and lend it to shortsellers.  Lol
Do some DD. MAC has value. It's profitable during pandemic. When economy opens up it's only going higher.
REIT pay their income tax to shareholder as dividend,  this is going to happen when they have more revenue and share value.
I highly believe that the dividend will significantly increase over the next year or two.  Before Covid they were paying 75 cents per quarter.  Conservatively, the board reduced the dividend to 50 cents in the second quarter, then 15 cents for the third and fourth quarters 2020.  Compare the dividend paid in 4Q2020 of 15 cents to the adjusted funds from operations in 3Q2020 (which most REIT investors look at to see if the dividend is sustainable).  It is a low ratio and most REITs I own are in the 60-80% level which I feel is conservative.

Do your own due diligence and you will see.
I just joined 5 minutes ago, Gen X
I have 15x the amount of karma you do lol
Yes thats why i am holding for long
The intrinsic value is 35-40, this is a move towards fair value
I am holding my shares all the way,  its a shitty counter attack from shorts
I am holding my GME as well,  this is a second target and explode protential,  why are you even complaining?
Any other stock should not be squeezed except his precious gme. 93% institutions and 7% insiders owned gem with more than 90% short ratio is being revealed here. Think twice...
I have 14, is it ok?
immediately automoderated bot their bot.
I tried, it got automoderated :(
lots of selling today, now is a good time to initiate a position
What you say is not retarded. But what he says is factually correct. Despite the pandemic they did okay, the business was in pretty good shape before. Stock has been hammered those last years because ""malls are dying"" right. But not every mall, some do very well. Macerich owns class A shit or whatever. Bottom line it remains a profitable business paying divis with cash flow, you dont even need a turnaround story to sell the stock. Im long MAC under 10 bucks simply because it was very undervalued. I did not realized it's shorted so heavily. I wish I could be as autist as you people here, but Im too scared for that. If you guys squeeze the shorts, I won't complain.
I thought that but the guy didn't buy 909% of normal volume by himself today. It's going to be another short killer.
not a bot, just a stock investor that did his dd and knows value when he sees it

I think it's fairly valued at $40. MAC has great fundamentals whether reddit notices or not. But if we get a squeeze we can easily see $100.

MAC didn't deserve to be shorted as much as it did. I suspect someone wanted to bring MAC to it's knees to buyout with a low-ball offer. Wouldn't be the first time.

If you're curious what happened BEFORE mass internet adoption, just look at how the SEC played companies dirty and let naked shorts just demolish company reputations.
Yup. Take example Broadway Plaza in WC, CA. It's been a high end shopping destination for decades. Retards can't show off their lambos and ferraris shopping on Prime. They roll up to Broadway Plaza, spend a few bucks then show off a bit more before returning to their meaningless lives. LOL
ofcourse bro! What do you think this is, an intraday scalp? Long and strong!
I think he may be shorting MAC to raise funds for trying to hold GME...any link to info on his positions?
Thanks!

....they have pre defined targets for stocks

when stocks hit those -  they sell

so its ok that they did not want to ride until 100
Same here.
I’m sure there is someone else on this thread with enough post karma that can upload this discussion thread to WSB.
...they do...
It is a good stock pays dividends. 
They have a highest quality malls.

It is shorted 58% so it will get squeezed like GME.
If it doesn't you will still own a high quality stock that you can make money of in long run. 

Its stock price tag will grow for sure.
Definitely bullish hold. Been bullish since late last year.
[deleted]
Nope I invest into GME and BB as well. All these are good short squeeze potential. Trust it or not. I had double my profit so far from short covering on MAC which affected by GME short squeeze.
what does this even mean, please explain for those of us who are not part of whatever weird subculture uses these abbreviations and terms

also have a downvote for telling me it needs to be upvoted instead of, like, explaining when I asked ""what the fuck is this gibberish""
I'm long the MAC Feb19 $25 calls, $1ea, 4K
Cool. Have you seen the other 50℅ of accounts commenting on this post?
I'm holding long now. Had a chat with the OP and he's legit.

Any proof? Be 10 soon.
OP might be fine - but look at all the 3 karma responders. It's fairly obvious what is happening and can down vote all you want but $GME is going to $1000.
I don't have GME. My comments aren't aimed at the real people on here, but nearly every post is by people with 3 karma. If you think they are all legit accounts then good for you :)
don't think you're getting the point... do some more reading up.
Are you still holding?
Lame. I’ll try, can I copy your post?
Didn't say a bot. A lot of the accounts replying to this thread are recently created and only mention this stock in their comments.
MAC == 622, see on the phone keypad!
Agreed, this thing has been short into oblivion for one reason or another. So tough to figure out when to get out. I had several recovery plays today pop at open, IRM went higher than pre covid levels, etc, etc. Pretty much all the ones that have significant shorts. Starting to think MAC could really hit 100, seems like the next obvious play or if nothing else, scare the shorts simply bc of risk mitigation at this point.

Feels like shorts are doubling down with that midday slouch/after hours however. Maybe it will play out by mid next week. Supposedly, GME still has 121% short w/ 2.1 days to cover via bloomberg terminal.
My man
Nice brother! You get the bigger picture!

Im new to all this and I am trying to wrap my head around it all. Thank you.
I smell hater.
Good catch detective :). what if the people having new account have a great idea about a new short squeeze option to share with the wsb guys of GME. Any other option in your mind to connect with the squeeze people if I do not have a reddit account already?
Positions or.. reputation tank
Fuck outta here bot
Not too sure on how calls work so I just bought 200 shares.

No way I would be able to afford 4K though.

Lol if GME goes $1k i will be incredibly rich as well.  Its called diversify.
Im diffrent, I just don't pretend to be a retard. And dont get me started on autism.
Yes.
Go ahead, as long as you actually believe in the company. I do. It’s not a pump and dump for me. 

I just wish more people realized that it’s a good underpriced company.
I understand but its unfair to paint everyone with a broad brush if you know what I mean. I am pro-Macerich and have been long MAC since Feb 2020....
Just look at the facts yourself. MAC is not that different from GME other than MAC actually has good fundamentals.

My eyebrows raised big time months ago when I saw the shares short on GME. MAC the same, just whether or not retail notices is yet to be seen..
I think GME will easily blow through 500 assuming the crooked SEC allows it to trade.

This is the time to scrape together some extra dry powder and look for the next target

Amen to that - a load of bots commenting to distract from $GME
The shorties are mad.
I meant your holding.
I hope you all do well. Watching GME with interest, but not getting involved now.
I totally do, I bought it super low, but with the covid impact its been hit way harder than it probably deserved. I think it'll come back on its own, regardless of a short squeeze.
Hard to get the latest short info because it's only updated every 15\~ days I think, but many seem to think this friday is options expiration and meaningful.

RKT is another one, 30%+ short and popped some today, waiting on that to blow up and exit as well.
That’s true my friend but just short whispering.
Im new, Im real, I can't post in WSB :(
What I don't get is that Melvin screwed multiple companies including MAC. But MAC gets no love here. After GME, MAC is one of the heaviest shorted stocks by Melvin.

MAC is profitable today, even during pandemic. This stock has good intrinsic value AND has the possibility of a short squeeze if retail piles in.

✅ Pumping doge

✅ Shill - trying to distract from buying GME
It's dropped a lot 😬🤯😬😖😫🥶
just bought a few thousand doge coin for chump change TO THE MOON 💎☺️🚀
So that’s it’s I guess it’s over for Doge.
you cant, or at least i cant buy on RH. I have money cleared weeks ago from sold stonks listed in buying power and it says insufficient funds even to buy $1 of DOGE
Dogecoin AND GME. Why not both?? To the MOON
Every single person should be getting in. No excuses
. Anyone can afford 4 cents a share. To the pluto!
They limited buying on DOGE thats Y it didn’t cross .10 - we need to keep buying and hold !!!
I want my dad to let me buy some but I don’t think he’ll crack. He laughed at me when I told him about this, but agrees that getting into the stock market is a good idea as long as I don’t be stupid. I really want to get some money into these companies and currencies so I can donate my profits
Where can I buy dogecoin other than Robinhood?
Why can I not buy doge on ameritrade?
I am new here. How can I buy Dogecoin?
Can I buy with cash? Tried coinbase but they don’t support Dogecoin.
Please help.
Thank you.
4 cents a share right now... should i?
naah.... lost good money bro. gotta watch out though. had to reinvest
Dogecoin is in unlimited supply don't fall for this
RH is not allowing buys od DOGE.
Wanna take over the stock market?

Here's how we do it:

""Borrow"" a bunch of Amazon, Google, big oil, etc.. stock and sell it driving the price down (short term)

Use the money you gained to invest in dogecoin and the hedge shorted stock driving those prices up even further

Buy back Amazon etc. At the lower price to pay back what you borrowed and buy a little extra (those companies will survive and the stock price will go back up)

Free money 😊
lmao
it will go up monday. Just do not sell the stocks. Do not lose your money.
Doge is notorious for building bag holders AKA losers turned long term investors 😂. It's a cyclical pump and dump that everyone falls for every 2-3 months lol
I think 1am it rips
Not yet. 😀
Why because it dropped?
Mine has been saying the same thing.
always stick with long-term investing. I think around 2023 DOGECOIN stocks might be around $10 maybe more and sooner. Who knows!
If you want to invest in crypto buy BTC and ETH. The rest are shit coins or pump and dump schemes like Doge. You will lose your money. Only BTC and ETH are good. Avoid shitcoins
Remeber this in two months and make shure to tell your dad to shut the fuck up from now on
I got 402 doge coins for like $17CAD, even if they get to $0.50 I will ~$200CAD. You don't need to dump a bunch of money into dogecoin because it's so cheap and right now, might not be a bad thing to have later
I think I’ve heard webull trades it
Ndax.io lets you buy doge
Don't. It's a pump and dump
for long term it worth it! 0.04 now but after couple years if that goes up to $10. I put couple thousand that I am not going to use for 2 years.
I really hope so! 😅 Some extra money would help out so much rn...
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. 10$ Boy you be smoking that good crack lol.
Well then as soon as I turn 18 imma make an account and hurl a good chunk at it, for the meme of course
Careful following all this hype. Especially with money that you need immediately friendo. Might be safer as USD but I can't see the future so maybe doge goes to 100 or .0000000001.
Hahahaha you never know
What about dad's that told thier kids no to bit coin??? No offense kid but ur dad doesn't seem to bright. Don't wait till ur 18 get 1 now n don't tell him $h!t
I can’t though, I’d need a joint account with him :("

Correct me if im wrong. I think what they are doing is selling their short positions that they made a while back and buying into new short positions that haven't appeared yet . which is why the current short % is lowering. They are basically shorting they're short position even further. is this correct at some extent ?

Perhaps the most critical milestone for the world this year will be the massive rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccine developed by **Inovio Pharmaceuticals** ([NASDAQ:INO](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/inovio-pharmaceuticals-inc/ino/)) could be among those administered in 2021. 

Inovio turned in a tremendous performance last year, with its shares soaring 168%. That gain could be a drop in the bucket, though, if the biotech's INO-4800 COVID-19 vaccine proves safe and highly effective.

You are willing to pay market value.  They double down on their short positions borrowing money right now.  IT is very expensive for them right now,  but they go broke settling here.  EVERY Market cycle a few of these guys blow it. LEHMAN BROS in the late 90s and ENRON.  IT IS VERY common. Borrowing at 1% rates make it easy to run markets up...  NOW they face margin calls and charges for the shorts.  CNBC blames you as they  very well know who  the players are the same Citadel, Muddy Waters, Carson block that ran shorts and hit pieces years back. The same ZERO HEDGE site that ran the hit pieces now tries to be your friend and stealing you blind.  85% of all stocks are in very wealthy peoples hands.  THE GOP and HEDGE funds won't tell you they destroyed all regulations that used to make this levorages, tricks, slime ilegal.  THE SEC knows better but they  want to back the big money people that make and break markets.

HOLD AMC ! REMEMBER BLACK MONDAY MASSACRE! 🚀🚀🚀🚀,195,https://v.redd.it/grennfjgd3f61,"I admittedly don’t know much about stocks so I didn’t want to invest too much but I do have 40 shares of AMC @ an avg of $11.40 a share. Currently at a loss but I hope the squeeze works
  

AMC stock it operated approximately 1,000 theatres and 11,000 screens in the United States and internationally. The company was founded in 1920 and is headquartered in Leawood, Kansas.   [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC?p=AMC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC?p=AMC)technical- rarely traded this low. Recent trading is not pricing in industry turn or vaccinations by mid-summer. Markets price 6 months out.   We will see shorts didn’t cover but doubling down. We could see another squeeze as hedge funds refuse to not win. WHEN CNBC starts lying to retail viewers it is a good sign, they are worried also.  THESE squeezes are normal between hedge funds. THE retail squeezes and little guy usually don’t start these squeezes.  The top   1% own half the stocks out. 15 % own 85% of the stocks. REPOST about AMC 👉🏽 Here I will lay it out for you......They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently, you guys don’t understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now?  Obviously not...That guarantees them a loss.  They best start covering, but they don’t. They want to pound this down at least another 50%.  The chart shows around 5 to bottom if they can keep selling to cover soon. This game is real crazy right here.  Margin calls and they must raise cash to keep positions. The longer this goes on, sideways trading now, the more interest they are paying on those shares. They will eventually crack and have to pay through the nose. I hope this helps everyone.” The company could retire a lot of debt right here offering stocks and help the bottom line. SHORTS could be destroyed.
Not only am I holding as I'm also buying more. As Mark Cuban said, if you believe the share is worth more you fucking hold on to it.AMC is not a 7$ share.
Also this was more than expected, the fat cats won't give up without a fight. Even GME dropped a lot. Even if AMC does not blow like GME did which everyone knows it won't, buying now will still make you some money in a not so long term. But then again, I'm a fucking retard and I thought this was Amazon as I am looking for books about cooking brocoli without spices.

Defendants Citadel ?  ZERO HEDGE and SHORTING hedge funds put out massive web site information and hit pieces.  THESE guys rape retail investors year after year.  GO to the site of Zero Hedge and see what you are up against and winning.  DURIN!  Used to be Muddy Waters and Carson Block.  If I remember right.Remeber NOT all hedge funds are bad by any means.   ZERO HEDGE used to be scum with   TYLER DURDEN. they would buy shorts and put hit pieces out to make the markets fall..  many times they were true or have some truth..   

   The hedge funds call thm selves experts but every down turn many go broke (YOUR MONEY). This time the    insolvent bearish hedge fund Melvin Capital (which as recently as last week had $12BN in AUM) which would have collapsed and been forced to liquidate its longs, had it not received $2 billion from Citadel and another $750MM from Steve Cohen. In other words, while nobody has called it that yet, we just lived through a mini LTCM.

they will need a lot more money soon..   I am sure they would not take losses here.   CNBC that also reported yesterday that the hedge fund had closed its shorts... which apparently was not exactly true). And while $2.75 billion may be pocket change for Ken and Steve, $5 billion starts to look like real money. And what if it has to be followed by $10 billion, $20.     CNBC calls this different ,  but this is not uncommon between hedge fund..

All good bro. No one is forcing you ^_^
They will take friday's loss , 44 000 000 expired options  that they have to pay back this week. Hold!! 🚀🚀🚀
Chill the f down. We love the stock we love the memes ❤️🚀
They are not required to cover shorts in the first days. They had to get below 4.57 $ to end up winning with shorts. hold and the squeeze will happen. Incredible amount of naked shorts today. It looks like a total war . Hedgefunds are literally selling shares to eachother to manipulate the charts . I'm holding :)
They do but if you look at AMCs history its at least a $20 stock when the economy is operating under more normal circumstances. COVID restrictions on business wont last forever and people will be going back to the movies. Hold for the squeeze or hold for the reopen, but buying a dip this low will at least double your buys over time.

Edit: oops thought i was responding to someone
Well its about the fight right now . AMC and GME
They are basically ""slacking"" us money by the time the bank make the transfer to pay them . They then go through a clearing house with our orders to process the orders and then the shares are physically traded against money  in a CSD (central security deposit) but each steps take about 24-48 hours to do. At one point, the volume of buying is so high that the CSD are telling them to bring more money in, in order to process these buying  orders. RH and others can literally  go bankrupt if they don't control the flow, de facto slowing down the whole process. This is their version. Who the fck knows if its true.
44 000 000 expired shorts on friday at 8 something and we closed above 13. They just havent paid it yet.
🚀🚀🚀👍🔥
To clarify, the plan is that eventually the hedge funds who shorted the stock will have to switch in investing in it which will raise our stock value right?
They are doing alot of restriction
I just bought VXRT,INO,SRNE today .  all have Covid drugs/ anti bodies  .    I added a little 3 times today AMC .  I just picked more up at 8.12
Thats literally what i just did and rationalized. They average 20 during normal times and peaked at 30 during marvels last bits of phase 3. Long term they are a good company.
Theaters ""apparently"" have opened today on the East Coast . I agree to your analysis.
Fair point, I just dont want to risk money on. those two rn since theyre going down
The timing and implementation of all this just wrecks of corruption.
That's not how that works. That's not how any of this works. LOL. 

Shorts don't expire, my friend.
if by expiry time it hasn't hit the prediction price, they have to buy the stock at the price at the moment of expiry.
THEY have to come up with a lot of money holding the short positions. They are going for broke. IT will draw other hedge funds  to destroy the greedy first shorts.  THIS will take time to play out.  ITS far from over.
Correct. They’re shorts run out tomorrow, which is when the real squeeze might arrive. Unless they hold and pay interests, then it might be Friday
Degiro and Trading 212. You are welcome. 🍻
neat AF 🚀🚀🍻
Seems pretty safe and really wise if one takes that stance. Buy the dip and hold for a squeeze or for a regular return to market price.
And as a community we should respect that  🍻
I agree. But if we hold the squeeze will have to happen at one point .
My bad should have wrote options lol 🍻
And when’s the expiry time hit?

Btw, thank you for taking the time to explain this to me
you won the first round and don't know it..  THEY lost a lot of money  FRIDAY
But yet we have won the first round on friday  brothers and sisters!
I am using now degiro , other options : vanguard,fidelity, ameritrade charles schwab
Exactly but the squeeze will likely happen. Friday they had to be below 8 something and we closed at 13. We won the first round 🚀🚀🍻
Exactly. I am not sure if it was foreseen but thats a smart explaination.
I agree as well. Should I continue to buy during the dip? What do you see happening in the next few days?
So... what exactly do you mean by paid, then? 

&#x200B;

You mean call options were in the money? Do you think those were all naked calls or something? Those shares would have been called away and put into option holder accounts today. They almost certainly tried to sell the shit out of them to GTFO with some money. That'll continue tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Any naked calls did just produce a short position. I assume anybody writing naked calls is a pro. They will cover at some point, but are likely in less of a hurry while the share price plummets relative to those shareholders who just exercised and want out with a profit.
the first one was at 1.17 day but often they don't pay it right away they re-borow  money at a higher interest rate etc. and buy right back in . some are at 1 day others are at 3 days and by the end of the week they have to pay back .
exactly. And now they are doing ladder attack to make us look like we are selling when in fact hedge funds are just trading shares to eachother. Hold until Friday. Tommorow should be mental. This is not a financial advice , we love the stock AMC 🚀🚀🚀🚀
hedge funds might keep selling shares to eachother to make it look like we are losing our composure. It's called a ladder attack . you might wanna watch this guy  . [What AMC days to cover really means ](https://youtu.be/jSp0I23rYz8)
[AMC DAYS TO COVER MEANING](https://youtu.be/jSp0I23rYz8)
Take a look at that. You will see from a different point of view. 🍻
3 days? So we have to hold until Friday?
So basically as long as we hold, the price won’t drop to where they need it to and they’ll have to pay back into the stock, which makes us money?
Good luck to you. If you can't see the writing on the wall, perhaps the lessons learned will help you next time.
Pretty much. Thats not an advice thats what I'll do myself
2 Highland Park whisky shots for you my friend
They have to cover back this week. Doesnt mean they have to cover on the same day. That's the nuance . If by the expiry date they havent reached their goal target , they have to buy these shares they have shorted. Simple. Tell me where I'm wrong with it.
i'll be able to buy my 15 shares tomorow some time. looks like i'll get more than 15 now with the price
Ayyyy! 🍻 thanks dude
Why would they have to cover this week??? Where on God's green did you hear that?

&#x200B;

They don't have to buy them back by any date. They opened a short position, just like any other, on Friday at 4pm EST at the option strike price.
No matter what you do, just hold the fort brothers and sisters.
Not sure what you think you know ...

In short selling, a position is opened by borrowing shares of a stock or other asset that the investor believes will decrease in value by a set future date—the expiration date. The investor then sells these borrowed shares to buyers willing to pay the market price. Before the borrowed shares must be returned, the trader is betting that the price will continue to decline and they can purchase them at a lower cost. The risk of loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited since the price of any asset can climb to infinity.
To open a short position, a trader must have a margin account and will usually have to pay interest on the value of the borrowed shares while the position is open. Also, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), which enforces the rules and regulations governing registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and the Federal Reserve have set minimum values for the amount that the margin account must maintain—known as the maintenance margin.1﻿ If an investor's account value falls below the maintenance margin, more funds are required, or the position might be sold by the broker.

To close a short position, a trader buys the shares back on the market—hopefully at a price less than what they borrowed the asset—and returns them to the lender or broker. Traders must account for any interest charged by the broker or commissions charged on trades.

The process of locating shares that can be borrowed and returning them at the end of the trade is handled behind the scenes by the broker. Opening and closing the trade can be made through the regular trading platforms with most brokers. However, each broker will have qualifications the trading account must meet before they allow margin trading.
... uh. Do you have any idea what the implications are of this obvious copy pasta of short selling? 

The people who sold naked calls (do you know what that means?) opened a short position on Friday. You're now claiming what exactly? That they need the margin to hold that position? They just made a fortune today. There won't get margin called on those shorts.
Friday it was shorted at 8.63 , at expiry we closed at more than 13. You are literally saying they have not to cover their loss despite us destroying their short positions. What you saw today was a bunch of hedge funds trading shares to eachother in an algorythmic manner to drive the price down , despite a huge buying pressure.
What are you talking about? You have no idea. You're just parroting the sales pitch from this site. 

&#x200B;

1) Normal people don't sell naked calls. 

2) If there was a high position of naked calls, it would almost certainly be deep pocketed hedge funds

3) If there were a lot of naked calls, they became short positions at close on friday

4) Those shorts are now *green*. There will be no margin call on those positions.

5) Shorts don't expire. They can wait as long as the margin holds, which is likely forever for these companies. 

6) Your long position is fucked.
Parroting what site?  There is no site to parrot. I am  talking about data/facts. Yesterday there was 95% buying presence with AMC against 5 % of selling presence. You have your analysis, I have an opinion ,you come here unwrapping your science while you can't even look at  data.  Hold means Hold. repeat after me but slowly: hoooooolllllddd. Doesnt mean much more than hoooooolllllddddd. 🤗
What the hell? Every sale has a seller and a buyer. What does ""selling presence"" mean to you exactly? 

Dude, you're flat out nuts. I almost feel badly you bought into this cultish sales pitch. i just explained to you why there is no deadline for anything. If anything, the expiry of those calls will result in *selling pressure*, not buying. 

Good luck. I have no stake in this either way. Just enjoying the show and watching lambs to the slaughterhouse.
Look. People were buying and holding.  Hedge funds were not. Naked shorts are illegals. What was the limit for them in order to make money yesterday? 
You are saying the 44 000 000 shorted shares killed on friday , wich were borrowed , were just returned to their ""owner"" without paying the debt of those shares. You are literally saying  short squeeze are non -existent due to a  notion that shorts don't expire and if they do , they were naked shorts transitioned into shorted shares. . Again. Illegal.
You have no idea what you’re talking about. LOL. You don’t even understand what I’m telling you in the simplest terms. 

You need to go back to Webster’s and figure out what options are. Then perhaps come back to the stock market.
Yeah. We are hundreds to not know what we are talking about .

Still holding, all the good movies are not even out yet.  Lets face it Disney will save AMC too many good Marvel Sony movies this year the stock will naturally hit 20 dollars on it's own in my opinion, but when Researched Spider Man Far away from home had the stock looking good.
AMC should slowly rebound with Vaccine roll out...  Doubly so if plans for gaming competitions to be held on the big screens there... (which would be rad...)

Stupid- sell it all
its up and down. Noting people can do when it comes to greed. #Facts it is in their nature to make money and sell. Here is another fact AMC is broke, they have to borrow money just to pay their leases and keep the lights on, If you want to change AMC boosting the stonk will help, but changing the BS Pandemic plan as in getting rid of it would help even more.

Real float is 91.5M and short volume is 78.5M. 93% owned by institutions and 7% by insiders. Check out Morningstar web page. If you do the math and exclude institutions from daily trade, only 5M shares available for traders. And think 78.5M shorted shares once more with this angle. An undervalued class A company with huge short ratio.
As a newbie to reddit how long should I be expecting to hold shares in things like MAC, I know you can’t predict it but a month? I saw some bot (I know I look like one too I’ve only just discovered reddit from a friend) talk about Feb 19th the other day, I’ve got some serious A4 200gsm paper hands and don’t want to sell at the first dip cus I’m scared of losses, any advice is appreciated
Mac here we come

I feel like this whole ordeal is pretty odd. Most accounts that are talking about MAC are pretty young. If you go to 

https://www.reddit.com/r/MACArmyBets/

You'll find a post by u/jayjay-MAC which is a year old, but only has a few posts beginning about 4 days ago and are all related to MAC. 

I can read what people are posting and it sounds decent, but can someone else weight in on this? Is an outside force trying to create this buy?
How do we know those guys aren't reading and preparing for this ?
I was in this before the pandemic and double down around $7, which was just a ridiculously low price. Hedge funds want us to believe no one's ever going to a mall again. And MAC's got the fancy ones you want to visit. They pushed it down to $5 but couldn't put it out of business. They started up their dividend again, so I guess they're going to make it. Once the vaccines get flowing there's nothing left to keep this down. People will leave their houses and want somewhere to go.
Great post, will follow the trade.

Are we still buying Gme because I bought 200 shares and I'm down tremendously
Boy o boy that is rocket fuel 🚀🚀🚀🛸
Good analysis.
 Nobody knows how long you would have to hold depends on how much hype MAC gets & when shorts decide to cover. If you have papers hands then squeeze stocks might not be a good idea since shorts really try to create huge dips so people panic sell. I’ve seen many people claim that shorts have to cover at x date and that's just not true, shorts just have to keep paying their marginal interest. I would guess it could happen faster than GME but no one knows when
I think you've got to forecast out to when the vaccines kick in, rates go down, and people return to the malls. You'll want to be in the stock well before then. The shorts are still treating this stock like the pandemic is here to stay.
And before the pandemic they were valuing it at $48. That was their reduced fair value before the vaccines came out.
I know several people are from stocktwits, that's where I was before being told about this over here. I don't think many people knew about reddit as a stock discussion forum until the GMA craziness.
I never asked anyone to buy, just want to share a great company that worth investing in from my point of view. Just do the DD and dig up all the legit info and news release online. I agree you should not trust those analyses or price targets from them.  I know my mall around me is packed with people today and MAC got rid of those lower-end/ not preformed malls last year with what left is the top premium mall that also an attraction point at the most attractive, densely populated area.

I can tell you I joined reddit because I saw the short squeeze potential of MAC, which I've been in for months, and wanted to see whether others were talking about it too. They are! I've been furious at how the hedge funds ganged up to keep the price down on MAC and was happy to see them upended for the same game they were playing with GME. We all come to it somehow.
MAC has over 80% short over float, clearly it is targeted for short squeeze.
That’s a question no one can answer bud
I'm sus cause your account is 15 days old
 

If you bought above 100 I would say you did. I would not buy GME now because no one knows how much higher it will be able to go or when it will pop. Coming from someone who was one of the first to buy GME based on the squeeze in November and held at an 80-98% loss until the squeeze. Right now the possible profit you can get vs risk does not seem worth it in my opinion. If it goes to 1000$ sure you would have 3x your money if you bought now but for the risk involved right now that's not really worth it then you’re just better off playing with other high OTM options. I think MAC has way less risk and could easily net a higher profit margin IMO, but do your own due diligence.
Yeah... I dont see it...
MAC is GME' landlord, why don't we do both and save our malls for our kids? 

Lets burn the shorter's pants off!!
I understand GME but NOK never sat well with me. MAC actually does have some genuine upside
Yes because some retarded teachers pension fund sold 200m worth of shares so people got scared that shorts were gonna cover all at once for that price, but they didn't Blackrock actually bought all those shares adding another 20M MAC shares to their pervious holding of 18M shares. Blackrock never has paper hands so we got backing form big boys as well
Good luck!
You do what you think will make you profit, MAC went down a ton the past days due to all other ""short squeeze"" stocks crashing, which I think is a good think since now its even more undervalued and at a even bigger discount
Problem is that’s a little more difficult for me as I’m from the UK so haven’t heard a single thing about vaccines or whatever in the USA
Thank you for some insight
Thank you for the response
Did you make an account just to reply to me?
Just doing more DD in this, do we know blackrock bought those shares directly?   That's actually good news is shorts haven't covered much at all.

$MAC Army Gather Here - This is where we ignite the rally!,169,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreet/comments/l6gvcf/mac_army_gather_here_this_is_where_we_ignite_the/,"I see you took some of my previous comments to put in your post there, Tree. I'm cool with that.

I've been in MAC for months, and I buy more with each small dip. Not only is the stock undervalued compared to the company worth, but it has higher short interest (days-to-cover) than all those other stocks gaining attention for short squeeze effects.

People who are upset they missed last week of GME need to focus on MAC.

I think this could push past $100. I think its fair value is definitely higher than today's price, and I think its reward/risk ratio is perhaps the biggest of any stock on the market today. 

If we can buy it up to $30-40 per share, I suspect the domino effect of the short-squeeze could push it way past $100. I don't think this is a zero-sum game for new buyers. I think, done right, we can all benefit.

[deleted]
Nice sell order tip 🚀🚀🚀🚀 retardsssss unite
I initiated my position today, along with SKT.  Their respective short levels are at 88% and 78% of their total float.  Not as bad as Gamestop, but still insanely high, and ripe for another GME-like short squeeze.
There is much at stake for the big institutions whose practices try to screw the little guy (the little investor and the little company). They will use propaganda on news channels and other tactics to try to shut the rush down.

For instance, this evening, there was a major sell-off afterhours on everything. This was almost certainly the big institutions trying to scare others into abandoning the game. They are also trying to position themselves with more cash for tomorrow and Friday so that their shorts are not called-in.

We, the little people, must buy the dips and hold. Friday's witching hour will get interesting!

Long MAC!!!

balls deep in this thing, already up 100%
The point that got me horny is class b and c malls are closing leaving even more demand for the best classAs... MAC has some of the best masks in the best areas... Simon properties tried to buy them in 2015 at 95.50 and got rejected.
This is one that can be squeezed really hard and nasty. We need some of the GME boys to see this one!

Have been holding for few months and not selling. Shorts haven't started to cover yet if you look at the short Interest rate
I’m in for 250 shares. Even on fundamentals, it was an interesting diversification play (at least for me with mostly tech) predicated on COVID recovery and the bet that prime real estate is a win combined with the human need for socialization. A fairly decent dividend helps. Then you add in potential upside of any catalyst could lead to a tsunami of shorts covering... this is a big one that could be GME like.
MAC army rise up!  🚀

As someone that bought MAC shares at the beginning of last year, and then watched them tank, this is exciting.
i will buy in tomorrow.  50 shares.
Inside, go MAC
Long since June 2020 and 2.5X my position since January to 2800 shares. Company’s fundamental makes the share price worth at least 35-50$ for now and more on the long term. There are no risk plus dividend comeback and improving malls traffic due to covid vaccine can push the price up a lot even without a shortsqueeze.

Deep in this one, buying more every dip. This thing has huge potential!
Great analysis! New user here, holding Mac since late last year.
Big today today for MAC.  88% of float short.  The naked shorts will be forced to cover soon, and it will spike the price.
Mac is in a dip right now! Good time to buy! Let’s start the squeeze! Hold on don’t sell. Buy as much as you can. Make those shorts lose the bet!
MAC is a strong business with a bright future.  Lots of money to be made at these levels for short term and long term investors.
Bought MAC randomly back at around 10$, only seen it go further and further. It's a weirdly good stock, with much more potential than just a short squeeze. Let's get this MAC to the fucking moon  🚀🍔  🚀 🍔 🚀 🍔 🚀 🍔 🚀
TO THE F\*\*\*ING MOON!!!!
 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
hopefully we get a pleasant surprise tomorrow morning with the dividend announcement!
MAC 🚀🌙 lets run it up
Sonnieboy1950- This is a real stock that pays dividends (albeit fragile).  The company  rejected a bid to buy the entire company some four years ago at around $92.00 per share. It now trades for less than 30% of that.  Granted the pandemic has dented the value of malls, but apparently  they have only the premium, strong properties.  If this company can survive a coming liquidity crunch and the vaccines sufficiently reverse the Covid 19 trend,  then this is a good stock based on fundamental value.  Busting the shorts is merely a sideshow compared to  the likely intrinsic value of the shares and underlying properties.  That’s the way you should look at it.
Everyone buy shares this morning! IT doesn't matter how many just buy some! Early momentum will set this thing on fire.
Agree, very good risk /reward bet with a nice book value and dividend to support current prices. And hope we hit the moon soon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
wsb cannot buy gme or amc, we need to spread the wors and have them go into $MAC
I bought more!
MAC Feb 19 $25 calls, look cheap?
I'm on board!   MAC daddy to the moon when the shorts start covering and running for the exits
This is a very good chance in fact for several reasons currently:

1. MAC has not gotten much attention from the community yet and as a result is not banned from trading anywhere.
2. MAC is in fact GME's landlords for a lot of their stores so there is a direct relationship
3. MAC has much better fundamentals compared to the other short interest plays.
4. MAC is still considerably cheaper and has much more upside.
ontario teachers probably bought into macerich at much higher levels. lets school these teachers and show them how its done 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

currently own 10k shares with a strategy to buy 5k more up or down from these levels and trying to decide which far out of the money calls are the best to purchase for ""group"" gamma squeeze.    any advice from options expert on this board?  thank you in advance!
Just now added to my position again.  Ripe for a short squeeze at 80+% of float.  Class A mall destinations are going no where.  Each metro area will be keeping their best malls, as the lower quality malls close down.   Consolidation means more earnings for MAC.

&#x200B;

Don't forget this is a severely undervalued stock that has good fundamentals.
Saying Macarmybets is unviewable
LEGIT DD FOR MACERICH (MAC)

https://youtu.be/54d4AcdADSo
There was an article yesterday about a large firm selling a massive chunk of MAC, and I've read of many day traders and investors who have been shorting the heck out of MAC this week, driving its price artificially lower.

For instance, if you look at shortvolume.com you can see that MAC had a high percentage of shorts today, which further depresses its price. That's actually the reason the stock price was so low this summer (a gift for those who caught it early). 

Frankly, this battle can't be won without a mass of individuals, and GME, AMC are clearly still the heavy favorites on forums. I could see MAC pushing into a small peak a couple times the next week, but I think the battle for an epic short squeeze is over. I do think the company is going to have a bright future, so I am not planning to unload all my shares. But I probably will rebalance toward my other value stocks (ATRO, WFC, BHLB, MTH), all of which have dipped nicely this week.

I don't know what's best, but I wish everyone luck!
With the recent major dip from that forced selling of MAC by the Ontario Teacher Union, this week is the best time to load up. You probably won’t see these prices again. I’ll be adding more on Monday and holding purely for the dividends and long term future and to Screw over these hedge fund assholes of course
Is any one buying call options on MAC? March 19? June 18? Strike price?
>Key-Tie2542

Yes, my apologies for not giving credit where it is due (will edit).  Just trying to get out as much helpful info as possible and condense it to one place.  Can't wait to watch this rip higher!  100% agree that $100 is easily feasible if not much, much higher.
The reopening trade has started! Combine that with the huge short interest and MAC is ripe. I think REITS are going to catch a serious institutional bid soon as they start to rotate to value and normal economy after rona.
Keep in mind that $spg wanted to pay $95.50 for MAC in 2015 and MAC management told them to F off because it was too low... Metrics have gotten better since. This is short term a $50 stock and maybe a lot higher on a squeeze.

I know this sub hates XSPA for it's past antics, justifiably so.  But it hit rock bottom at 1.18 just 3 weeks ago, and has organically recovered to about 2.28 before all of the craziness this week started adding to the volatility.  It's an incredibly highly shorted stock, with nothing but good news for weeks now, new locations, partnerships etc.  It's a solid target for punishing shorts, decent stock with the potential of an actual future.  It doesn't have the nostalgia that GameStop or Nokia do, but it's already up .40 in pre-market and just this morning with very little momentum was able to squeeze to 3.70.  I think we may see that strategy repeat today or next week, combined with natural growth.  It won't go parabolic like GME did, but gains are gains.  I'm all for it.

Still available on your broker app btw!🚀🚀🚀
PSA: pretty sure Webull still lets you trade GME, AMC, and BBRY with a similar “no trade fee” model to Robinhood.

I can't transfer my positions or portfolio to a new broker can I? or do I have to wait til I have positive gains, cash them out and pick a new broker?
This is not the first time this has happened. ""Market Manipulation"" does not mean what you think it does.
How do we sign up for the class action law suits? F**k that
They hit me hard on naked. Up to 3.40.. Within 10 mins  down to 2 in hours and kept going. today we went up but not much
 I can't even buy it on those.

Are you in the negative? If you’re with Robinhood I think it’s best to cash out at the highest point then switch. That’s what I’m going to do. In the meantime we hold!
They are blatantly controlling what can and can’t be done to influence something.

Thank you thank you
""Market Manipulation"" is not just ""manipulation"" with market in front of it. It's actually a defined thing in Law. I am going to be blatantly honest here: The amount of ignorance I've seen in the last four days is astounding; people barely seem to grasp what's going on, very rarely understand what things actually are (i.e. the term Market Manipulation), and also are blinded to the other side of the equation.

The reason the tickers are blocked is because the *risk to the brokers is too fucking high*. They can't unwind these trades. You see, if all of the GME options were to be ITM and expire there are no stocks to fill the stuff. Staving it off at the head, GME + ""The Cadre"" is trying to solve the issue and buy the brokers time because they can't actually function, they'll get crushed under the weight of these orders, esp. with Institutions putting orders for millions of shares back and forth and the SEC's rules and tripwires triggering all the time as these stocks become so unstable that they can't even be priced well enough to have accurate spot pricing for the options chains.

Brokers are fucked. This is equivalent to a ""run on the bank"".
Exactly — someone is paying for it and at the end of the day it’ll be us regardless if we win or not. They are controlling what’s happening on their end by influencing what we can do to protect themselves. At the end of the day, they lose but win at the same time cause they’ll be bailed out on all taxes paid off from the “sell” of these stocks that are fucking them up.
Let me lay out very quickly what happens if you have an ITM call that expires. You are owed shares *that do not exist*. There are so many of these orders that actually if they do expire ITM the broker is actually responsible to get them to you or to somehow work out how to get themselves off the hook.

This isn't a game of winners and losers here. There is no David and Goliath. Just like if your bank can't get you the money everyone loses if your broker can't get you the shares everyone loses. The brokerages can't actually cover the value of this stuff so lo and behold if they go bust you are just out of luck. You're not protected by FINRA or any SEC based protections because it's not fraud, it's just flat out bankruptcy, and it's been a while but brokers do go bankrupt.

E: What's worse Robinhood just removed tons of tickers after a lawsuit from Mass. General Attorney for being ""reckless"" and allowing people to be ""reckless"" the same! They are double-fucked.
Good stuff. So what’s your next move?
The rest of the market of course. I made a few thousand trading some GE today. It's just what I do.
After GME what’s your next stake?
I have no idea. The fog of war (market games) rarely lets one know what's coming. :)

NOK actually has some legitimate potential.  Do some research on them.  Some think they’re well positioned for 5G.  Don’t hate because you’re not rich now; anYthing worth while takes time and hard work. Be patient and rational.
MAC
I personally believe NAKD$ will take off they have new management, whole new business direction , not cheap and do not make it in sweat shops, going to include even more brands as they take off they have a volume of like 2.5 billion and the market cap just tripled 

might be the next etsy

this is my personal belief invest at ur own will

  Levi & Korsinsky, LLP, a national securities law firm that has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors, announces that it has commenced an investigation against Robinhood and other popular retail trading platforms on behalf of investors who invested or were prevented from investing in GME and other stocks pursuant to trading bans on these stocks.
Ys I do.  It's in the 'wisdom of the crowd'.  This is a seminal moment in social-financial justice.  We are being told that we do NOT know how to handle our assets.  This is completely unacceptable.

   The implication is that we need to be regulated because we do NOT have the ability to understand our finances.  The hedge funds can trade, and we are cut off?! REALLY?. The hedge funds validate the 'rules' when it serves the hedge funds to do so.  When we want an equal playing fields; ""Oh NO. We can't have that!""  Why / Because the rules aren't helping us, say the powers that be.   from:  DrJimmystocks
... Encavis (WKN 609500). Ironically, a value from the renewable energies sector is the most strongly short-sold share in Germany. According to the Federal Gazette, 13.35 percent of all shares in Encavis are currently sold short by hedge funds, and this proportion is not higher for any other German shares. The Federal Gazette only lists items that are greater than 0.5 percent. In fact, many more Encavis shares are likely to be short.
well cats out of the bag now. The people now know we can pretty easily fuck with hedgefunds and bankrupt them with enough of us lol.
Reply to this comment or upvote  if you agree, downvote my comment if we are ignoring everything else and only pumping GME
GME is the main target so we can collapse every hedge involved in next to illegal short trading going on. The goal is to inflate it to astronomical proportions and bankrupt everyone shorting it. We’re not in it for the money. We’re in it to rape and pillage Uncle Sam for turning a blind eye to this bullshit. I personally bought at $290 and I’m not putting anything more in until I know exactly what it’s gonna do. If it drops below $250, I’m buying another share. If it keeps rising, I’ll just hold. If it stagnates, I’m out. Friday is the day of reckoning. But in all honesty, my unofficial advice is to buy some AMC and BB too because they’ve filed for bankruptcy or announced they were close to declaring it. BB I have no clue and Nokia I have no clue. I’ve doubled on both BB and Nokia. I’m playing the waiting game with them. Ford I have no clue. If it dips below $10, or stagnates around the same as it is now, I’ll buy in.

I can still read WallStBets, but I cannot submit posts or comments.

As others have said, it looks like GME and AMC are the big WallStBets targets, but various other groups both within r/WallStBets and others (r/WallStreet, r/ShortSqueeze, Twitter, SeekingAlpha, and so forth) have been parading several others like BB, BBBY, NOK, MAC, KOSS, EXPR, and now even NAKD.

Part of the initial push for GME was its high Short Interest, but that is simply not the case for most the other stocks being pushed (AMC, BB, NOK, KOSS, EXPR, NAKD etc.).

Forcing a huge ""Short Squeeze"" was really only a thing for GME, MAC, SKT.

As userg5l says, there is other motivation besides the squeeze to pump these stocks, including trying to keep them out of bankruptcy. AMC was perhaps especially vulnerable financially, but their company executives recently said that's no longer a threat because they have now diluted with more shares at the present high prices.

As I see it, attacking the heavily shorted stocks will have the most profound effect not only in making money for us, but also in ""Sticking it to the Man"" (forcing big institutions to cover their shorts at a premium), and perhaps even in reforming policy.

But whatever each of you chooses, I wish you luck!

Stay in GME Keep holding
Instead of raping and pillaging, why not get a job, work hard at it, save your money, read about investing, and then invest the money you’ve saved, and (hopefully) watch it grow?  Most rich people don’t get rich over night; it takes time and good decision making.  Don’t blame others for what you don’t have; be responsible for yourself and you can get ahead.

Before it got gutted I had made around $1300 on it. Thought everyone was sticking to it and during after hours it dropped like a bucket!

[they made a post last week about shutting shit down, don't think a WSB telegram wouldn't see the same fate ](https://t.me/durov/149)
Hey man I have a question... are you in wsb group? I’ve gotten banned from there and I’m wondering why and if I can get back. Honestly loved the community and would love to get back in it.
Lol listen, I literally have no clue wtf I’m doing and am just following y’all, but re: the account this is because my lazy ass deleted my old account, which was years old, and kept putting off creating a new one. I saw the original thread and decided fuck it. 

While y’all hold GME, my broke ass is trying to make some $ off Naked. I did too until everyone panicked and sold (or decided to cash out whateves) as the thread went down so, I know I’m sus cuz I have less than 1 day, but I assure you I’m just r lol
[deleted]
Yeah it went private for a little while idk if it was shenanigans by the hedge funds or just a crash from a shit ton of activity but it is back now.
Lol fair enough, the two dudes you’re replying to tho are defs bots. Idk shit about nakd but good luck with it, I’m just sitting here hoping like fuck that GME goin to 1000.
Might be better off going back to irc
If you don’t mind I’d like to ask ... if I make a post about a stock that I think will soon sky rocket based on research and so on ... would that be okay on wsb?
Damn it. I never Can differentiate bots 😂😤😫 
But good luck to you too man! I wish I could comment on the original thread/ community but obviously can’t. What you guys are doing is fucking amazing and wish I had discovered you all when I was sitting on 2k and doing nothing with it in my RH account cuz I was not happy with the returns and constant whiplash. At least here it’s worth it. If naked holds/ goes up even one dollar, I’ll make enough to not work or worry about it for 2 months, and he’ll THATS enough for me right now lol. I hope you all shoot up to 1k / I get the balls to join you all before it hits that mark (waiting for some more money or might sell all of naked and jump in)
[deleted]
Right now it would probs get insta deleted since it is such a shit show atm. They are deleting most posts. If it was a thorough DD it probs wouldn’t get deleted, some high effort posts take a couple of tries to stay. No guarantees though.
Lol all good I never could until the swarm of them that came in over the last couple days gave me enough practice. I’ll be curious to see how NAKD goes, if it blows up you’re defs getting in early which is rad. I’m stoked with how GME is going, I only got 85 shares but it’s already been amazing for me. I thought I was getting in late but I sent all 3k I had in my account at avg of $27 and needless to say I’m fucking pleased with the decision. If it gets near 1000 that’s 100k for me (Canadian money) which is more than I could have imagined making when I started investing in September. Shit is life changing for a lot of people. So fingers crossed for this last week, we’ll see how it goes.
For sure. Anyone can create one. Anyone can connect. You can out one on any server. Even a raspberry pi can handle a good sized server
Alright thanks for your reply I’ll surely check it out ... meh just wanna share what I think is a good stock to help the people... I’ll dig around and see what I can find. Thanks for your time man really means a lot.
Fuckkkkkk here’s to you man! Tipping my hat off and hoping for those blessings / 100k for you! 

Yes I scrolled all the way back to naked’s start and saw it used to go for hundreds. I’ll be happy if it freggin goes up to $10 shit lol. I looked at game stop and noticed the heavy dips here and there but the steady climb so trying not to be a little b and just reminding myself to keep eyes on the prize. 

Excited to see what y’all/ the community do next!
WSB is primarily for options trading anyway, it’s gotten flooded with people buying shares for GME but if you have a good idea about a stock you want to share I would do that at r/stocks. It’s also a good sub.
Thanks man appreciate it, the more I read about it the more I feel like it could really get there. 

Hopefully this is just the beginning for NAKD as well, atleast it didn’t dip after hours like all the other stocks that have been shooting up recently.

WSB is such a crazy sub lol but this was defs the craziest shit I’ve seen in my short time there. Cool to see the whole sub come together for GME never would have imagined that it’s cool as shit tho."

I was here when they got salty for losing then turned off the game for everyone.

We need to regroup ASAP before we all get disconnected. This is the whole idea. They think they won by banning our groups, we have to be innovative to come up with the group. They showed their muscle power of money by working with govt and online sites. Only Papa Elon has to give the signal for our next plan so we can fight these suits with our muscle power or public. This is muscle power of money against muscle power of public!!
Keep me posted
Yes and I believe off Twitter as well

What are the best to invest in today. What’s your recomendation
... Encavis (WKN 609500). Ironically, a value from the renewable energies sector is the most strongly short-sold share in Germany. According to the Federal Gazette, 13.35 percent of all shares in Encavis are currently sold short by hedge funds, and this proportion is not higher for any other German shares. The Federal Gazette only lists items that are greater than 0.5 percent. In fact, many more Encavis shares are likely to be short.
Yass
New to this. How long do we hold?
Which stock should i buy and hold??
Can't lie it's nerve wracking to see it in 260's
🇺🇸🇺🇸
What about buying though? I assume its not very viable to buy right now in GME. Any other recommendations?
No more freedom of speech
They're flooding our communication. Dirty but old school tactics of theirs. They want to drown us and scare us.

Now is the time to clench your teeth and hold. This is bigger than the tendies, this is a whole new goddamn special interest.
Dude, ya think? ...or is this the next Ponzi that you've created, tryin to get rich....alot of you are gonna get hurt...and BADLY....just sayin. Think about it before you put your rent money on it...
Yes, consequences are often something they need to beware of
I agree 100%
It'll make them look fantastic.  People believe whatever the news instructs them to believe. The news is anti-wsb and anti us. Therefore America for the most part is against us.
eventually they will stop it. put more restrictions on us. they are already gonna start halting tickers. only they can manipulate.
Love you brother.  Remember the good times.  Like noon today.  Those were good times.
Miss you too

Wow @ the blatant free speech violations. These aren’t private companies anymore. They’re ingrained in normal, human life, and have enough stock in life where they now need to follow at least the free speech laws which can be used to otherwise take our freedom away.

CNBC also stated that Melvin had completely closed out of GME, don’t trust them.
If you wanna trust in CNBC...
they are saying private on their website.

Regroup on Telegram
Let’s go.  What’s the tread!
All I know is don’t sell. I can’t offer financial advice, but my opinion is to hold until there’s a very sudden increase that climbs in hundreds upon hundreds of the percent. It’s the mother of all short squeezes. It’s Melvin and Citron going bankrupt.
[deleted]
It's after hours trading from the institutions purposely trying make it look like the stock is going down for good and that the squeeze is over. It's a psyop! Don't fall for it! As soon as retail investors get in tomorrow morning, it'll pump again.
Nokia id say
Never has been
Exactly this.  Been telling some buddies last few days to jump on board.  All of sudden they are repeating the nonsense on the news about how we’re all idiots and ruining peoples lives.  I tried to explain.  They were too far gone.
I don't blame them for going dark. If anyone knows anything be CAREFUL who you tell.
Vet people vigorously, they're flooding the coms. it's an old school boomer tactic and they'll flood any other they find.

In fact don't even tell me!

This old autist is gonna hold like a bulldogs jaws. This is bigger than tendies.
Was wondering the same thing too
Is there a new one?
I think it is they where reporting on it this morning on the local news the establishment is ahitting their pants and they are saying that this could fling us into another depression, GOOD
Thank you :)
They’re most likely making changes like post requirements and stuff to keep bots away
Did it not recently dip?
Wondering the same thing
Ya they can cry all they want, but one things for sure, don't call people stupid just because they don't have millions of dollars from participating in a broken system. That'll go sideways real quick because people will absolutely gather and work hard to prove them wrong.
Discord is down too. Hopefully it's just because the sub went crazy today.
Yeah wallstreet closed of nok, amc, and so on to force people to sell. But im hoping that this pisses the right amount of people of so that when it opens people start to buy at a crazy rate. Nokia has also just inked a deal with T-mobile and secured 5G so it should grow steadily if not insanely like GameStop or blackberry.
Same! It's so frustrating
the Discord is banned. It's gone.
Damn, so now that Nokia dipped its a good time to buy it correct?
It should be, but I would not spend more then your willing to loose just in case."

Wsb vs. hedge funds next?
I would love to try. Maybe you can hint to me what that might look like. I can't really imagine how I could represent that
I can think of a ton of them how about a painting of a man in a suit with a Rolex watch holding a a page in the dictionary that shows the word hedge fund highlighted. He’s holding it out as if he were going to hand it to somebody and it’s a little Wall Street Bets character with a cigarette lighter burning the page coming back at him.

You could also put those two in a fight like fight club.

You could show Wall Street with an explosion coming up through the middle of the street and the little Wall Street bets guy over there pushing the plunger on a detonator.

Any sports matchup and have the hedge fund team like three year old toddlers in suits and the Wall Street Bets guys in Random surfer dude clothes, but show the score. 

Just put yourself into the mindset of how the Wall Street Bets AMC traders feel and put them in any coming from behind, but dominating position over the hedge fund stereotype. Good luck— you’re very talented.
Doooood those are amazing ideas! I really like the blowing up wall street one.  Fuck yah thank you bro.  I can start to imagine these fer sure
I am very high on creativity and very low on talent. You’ve got all that —go for it. 👍🏻🚀🏆

Where u buy doge in EU
Yes buy dogecoin!!!
Where do we buy this?
O.08...mah it actually touched 0.09
People investing in this shit could literally don’t understand how it works. It’s literally designed to create tons of inflation. It’s a joke coin that is inherently impossible to hold value with. If you’re buying late into this pump and dump, you’re gonna lose a lot of money.
Buy buy buy
Its funny how this coin has unlimited coins making it virtually impossible for it to get to a $1.00. Unlike Bitcoin where only so many were made causing the price to rise the way it has. DOGE ha unlimited coins making near impossible to get near a $1.00. It truly is a meme coin and was created as a joke by a developer that worked at Adobe.
What platform do you guys trade dogecoin on?
What broakge is tgat
I’m in all the way

Not a freaking way I am going to touch with Robinhood after the gme fiasco. Might have to mine my own if it is expensive.
I literally watched it happen and sold it at 0.079 because it was resisting to break 0.08 for a second time for the day.
It's still a decent medium, even if they're traitors.
That’s your choice lol that’s how the market works don’t just shot up to a $1 over 24hr lmao

You can also get DOGE in the Yobit exchance. And in /rdogecoin they have a pinned post on the different ways to get Dogecoin

Use a platform that has the ability to buy crypto currency
Exactly, play the market. I do feel doge will hit at least .10 today though so buy it up now.
Yes I do but I'm the right one for this I'm here from the beginning, not new to this
Why not ? We gotta start somewhere my friend $1 has always been the goal cause once it hits a dollar it can become a bank like bitcoin
I was excited to see Crypto.com listing DogeCoin but I was disappointed when I saw doge is not available to US residence. I hope they will make it available for us soon.
I use coinbase.  But I dont see dogecoin in the list of currencies to buy
Coinbase doesn't support doge try robinhood or binance
because its not a real asset. just buy into btc

There is much at stake for the big institutions whose practices try to screw the little guy (the little investor and the little company). They will use propaganda on news channels and other tactics to try to shut the rush down.

For instance, this evening, there was a major sell-off afterhours on everything. This was almost certainly the big institutions trying to scare others into abandoning the game. They are also trying to position themselves with more cash for tomorrow and Friday so that their shorts are not called-in.

We, the little people, must buy the dips and hold. Friday's witching hour will get interesting!

Looks like not any more... maybe one many to jump and that is it...
It's not necessarily about finding out something no one knows about as much as it is being there early so when everyone else figures out that ""xyz company"" is undervalued or overvalued you're already in there and get out with profit. That's what DFV did. You do your homework and connect the dots. It's hard making money, even in stocks.
IDK, depends on what percentage of the stock is held by non-retards vs. retards (as you guys refer to yourselves).

I'm guessing non-retards >>>>>>>> retards.

Soooooo.... they're dumping the stock gladly for short-sellers to buy up.  Who do you think is buying GME on it's way down?  It's the crapload of short sellers that threw down when it hit $350+.  Now they're making a mint.
Even if they haven't, stock needs to be above 115 to squeeze. There's a fine line between realistic and blind optimism.
Lol remember trust nothing you hear and only half of what you see. Keep holding the bag. Be smart.

Short data
💎💎💎💎💎
How do you ""do your homework""?
Anything over $2 is a squeeze. There are so many shorts under the $2 so the stock has to hit that for the squeeze to be done. This is all a scare tactic. I am holding
HOLDING AMC FOR THE CAUSE. I could sell for a profit still but this is bullshit what they're doing. Calling us the manipulators. They literally forced people to sell or sold for them without their permission to drop the price and instill fear.

Elon is making moves again,114,https://i.redd.it/2c5sy378l9g61.jpg,"Knew this day would come
1. Makes sense... he acknowledges Dogecoin is a joke, saying it'd be funny if in fact Dogecoin became defacto currency.

OR

2. The above sentiment was just his wim of the day, and accepting Bitcoin is just step one in accepting other crypto (i.e. Dogecoin).

Don't know.  Accepting crypto as payment doesn't have a downside as I see it, the problem is ""crypto"" is kind of a joke in the mainstream world.
Buy a Tesla for 1 BTC. Noooiiiceeee
Tesla invested 1,5 Milliarden not Billions ‼️ that’s just fake.
I think he also was just validating his change of heart towards Bitcoin too and I totally agree with you too. I've invested in crypto before but never did much with it. Sometimes I feel like it means more to the ones who invested early in Bitcoin who go crazy over it. Maybe it's just me...
That’s how things start brother, first step of acceptance is it being treated like a joke.
1 American billion = 1000 Milliarden (millions)
1,5b = 1500 Milliarden (millions)
OR crypto ends up pushing tulips.

THE PEOPLE’S CRYPTO 🦮,117,https://i.redd.it/1m9mp7cc7ff61.jpg,"The only reason I keep my Robinhood open is they are the only place I know to buy  Dodge coin and it's free. Other than that they are dead to me I use Fidelity to trade.
I believe there's pent up demand for Dogecoin in US.  People just don't know how to buy it since it's not on Coinbase, etc.
It’s lost all momentum don’t buy in you’ll lose money I lost over 100 in a day bc of it
DOGE is the poor mans cousins brother of crypto in relation to BTC. I like it. Unfortunately, the volatility of it makes me shudder.
Link to tweet?
Elon knows whats good 🚀
Can’t buy it through Coinbase yet.
True
I'm in it for 1-2 years boi, curious to see where it goes.
That’s what I said a month ago I bout 220 lost 65 sold now is worth like 1400 in just a month
Yeah, but long-term that scrappy poor man's cousin's brother will outperform BTC.  DOGE is ""young"" in the sense that it's still so friggin cheap.
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357241340313141249?s=21
Agreed it is. Unfortunately for it to ever gain value, it’s going to have to be used as payment. BTC being adopted as payment in places is what continues to keep it relevant and useful.
Yeah... we really need to get the criminals on board. Do they reddit? :-P

Yo im kinda new to this and I’m only invested in Doge. My investing amount was just at $156 but dropped to $115 in a split second but doge has only been going up. can someone explain?
I’m in. Let’s Gooo!
I'm hyped for this train!!
They locked it for me. It’s saying can’t purchase yet in Indiana. My coworker literally bought it yesterday.
Doge better not play with me lol. Just dropped fast.
I CAN’T BUY IT WHAT CAN I DO
I’m trying to buy Doge but Robinhood is really giving me a hard time. It keeps making me review the user agreement over and over and over and over again. After a while of that it just gives me an error. I guess I’ll try again tomorrow
Where can one buy? I only have cash app set up
What platforms do you canadians use for crypto? I used coinbase before bit everytime I try to add my debit card I get an error. Havent been able to add a payment method all week
What exchanges do you guys trade on? In trying to get started in crypto, seems all have tons of bad reviews tbh
great where can I buy it besides Binance.... because they are cunts and wont let me and I even have crypto in their account. Stupid because I live in the US
Fuck outa here with your half a day old account.
I’m in!
Only the beginning!
I need info on this too 🇨🇦
You can buy using Binance
Check where it says average cost. Its going up super quick! You should get it right back
I just bought 5 minutes ago. Do you have good internet connection?
Still rising!! Dont worry
Close and reopen app. Maybe restart phone
Close and reopen app. Im not having any problems right now in NC
Coin base!
my total just keeps on dropping while doge is rising
I’ve closed and reopened many times now. Not quite sure what’s going on
wrong its not on coinbase
On mine, today's return has been saying negative too. But the total return is saying positive. Its almost at .06 now!!
Maybe restart phone? Try again every so often
Over .07 now!

I noticed this yesterday and was wondering why, my best guess is they are reportedly the top two in terms of short interest.
I dont care what you say there is no damn way that can happen naturally or be a coincidence. That's just a plain demonstration of how the system is rigged.
well, when the same people from the same place called Reddit put money into the same exact stocks then there are going to be similar patterns. I mean look at Nokia, amc, gme, and all the other ones reddits were foaming at the mouth about and see what they look like then. if they're the same then maybe it's just reddit
lmao no amount of coordination could create these graphs unless it was one person moving TRILLIONS or it was a bunch of bots created by the hedge funds to make a short ladder attack. sure a small portion of the movement is effected by us but there is no way these stocks get sold and bought in the same minute instances with out any fraud. we lick windows you think reddit is coordinated enough to do that?"

GME buy, and hold, even looking at the dip in after hours has my feet feeling a little cold. Stay strong we all know what the goal is ($1000+/share, which by the way if we hit that Elon Musk will put the GameStop logo on one of his rockets and launch it into space 😂) the goal hasn’t changed even with WSB unavailable just because it’s down for a couple hours doesn’t mean we all need to freak out. Band together and keep pushing, just because we’re in the dark doesn’t mean the goal has changed, even if the market opens tomorrow @$250/share then that just means the stock price is on sale! Buy up at a good price before it continues it’s rise to $1000+/share
is GME still a buy???
Sooooo...who is next...pge?
Seems to be, just hold, they know they're screwed by Friday closing if GME rockets to 1.000, wich is totally doable

It will never go up buying on dips
Sadly Robinhood is the easiest right now that I know of.

I use Robinhood

If it drop it’s only gonna drop to 6 at the lows then go right back up lol
If that’s how you feel why you even buy any lmaooo
