Millennials will never get to retire,284,https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/my5h30/millennials_will_never_get_to_retire/,"[deleted]
I think your assumption is too much that things are linear. History is cyclical and exponential. Bubbles don’t last forever... and neither do bad economic times. Both are cyclical. Things will get worse before they get better, the stock market will crash and millennials will get the sale of a lifetime, just like in 1933-40. The economy will reset, the private sector will clear its debts through defaults, (which will be similar to the great depression in terms of pain) but the economy will get better as bad companies fail and debt is cleared up for newer, more successful companies to grow. In the Great Depression, people thought the world was ending, they were being punished God, and things would never get better. They had no clue they were clearing debts and getting rid of bad companies to set theirselves up for one of the biggest booms in history. Yes, it will suck for millennials who are within 15 years of retirement to see their stocks drop 85% in value. But they still have 15+ years to buy stocks that will be VERY cheap.

Also, a stock market that goes up forever without inflation in the real economy is just impossible. Idc how much central banks support it. People look at valuations and lose faith at a certain point. The same thing happened with John Locke and the Mississippi Land Bubble and South Seas Bubble. And people pulling money out of a bubble like that doesn’t result in inflation. Historically, it results in a massive crash that’s followed by deflation.

Have optimism. History is cyclical.
Greetings, I feel your thoughts. And unfortunately I have to agree with some. 

In short, economies are cyclical and both inflation and deflation just happens - either force majore, a black swan event or a technological breakthrough or... Covid QE combination. 

The problem is that QE cannot go forever, but it can go for a few years. During that time the economies of EU and US become full of malinvestments, bubbles. The increase of asset prices which is synthetic leads to bubbles and stagflation. We don't want stagflstion, meaning we don't want QE forever. 

If the governments turn off QE rapidly - we might have a deflationary ""superale"" period. But it is unlikely as printing works very well with low interest rates. 

So realistically speaking we are likely to see a 2-3 percent annual inflation in relation to CPI items, however appreciating assets will get more expensive disproportionately, for some time. As long as we don't see mass unemployment, mass foreclosures... We are unlikely to see a very much needed correction. 

Right now governments, and ECB and Feds are bandits in a getaway car. But the police of economic correction will get them, either the fuel runs out (printing and stimulus) or they crash into a wall fast. This can also be a long ride, if QE is prolonged. 

This is a crazy situation, where the most of money ends up in the hands of already rich people and they push it towards appreciating assets, real estate and stocks. The little guys run after also. 

Hyperinflation, with low money velocity is a myth, at least for now, we are in a deflationary period which is masked by stimuli and MMT QE. 

The problem is that QE works only for a certain period of time, so one way or another there will be a deflationary period. The problem is how long we need to wait.
Theres a way out, the door is closing though. It’s cryptocurrencies and ditching the dollar, all together, before the institutions beat us to the finish line.
I'm
On average? Sure. For most people, like for most of history, it'll revert to a pattern of people not retiring so much as working until they die or they can't and then languishing in some degree of poverty for a bit before dying. The idea of only those with kids getting to retire is sort-of right in that those who can move back to a more 'multiple generations living under one roof' will be better off than those who can't, but I think enough millennials without kids will shift to a communal model with friends that it won't be as wide a divide as in the past.

For those who manage to avoid crippling debt levels and do want to 'invest' the options are basically the same as they were 10, 20, 30yrs ago - the only difference is you should expect lower returns across the board. You can do precious metals, businesses, real estate, stocks in anything and everything, crypto, and debt. Crypto is new, I guess. Just remember the goal is downshifted; Effectively you aren't saving for full retirement as much as saving so you can move to part time work when full time work becomes too much for you.

Not sure what to invest in? OP is right, invest in yourself first. Beyond that depends on your personal tolerance for risk and optimism for the future + your morals. If you expect the middle class to continue to be hollowed out, with a slightly larger upper class and a massive underclass, look to rent seeking income streams and luxury goods / services. Depending on your time horizon, index funds or etfs in the stock market can still be worthwhile, if only because everything else has been made so much worse.
The government is not trying to subsidize the market, they're trying to subsidize their own bonds. The market is just a side effect.
maybe the millennials have their revenge through crypto. Maybe their is a ""grand equilibrium"" coming where stocks lose their purchasing power relative to crypto but at the same time are NFT-ized into crypto.
The last paragraph screams your ignorance. We use gold in every single computer device and bitcoin isn't owned by any single entity and until something better comes around, both will continue to appreciate. I'm willing to bet in a few decades most first world nation citizens will have an electronic identity for everything. The things you do now are a thing of the past, within a few generations our entire social lives will take place in a virtual world like ready player one. The pandemic will rage on and force all legal social events online, even clothes shopping will become more virtual by way selfie image modeling.
Ok, so two things:

First off, stop voting for Democrats who enact these ponzi schemes at the behest of “intellectual experts” that are insulated from public scrutiny via the bureaucratic administrations they’re employed in, and who refuse to change their preferences regardless of what empirical data points to, such as in issues like minimum wage, the poverty-crime correlation (particularly with murder rates), rent control laws, the death penalty, the war on poverty, and so on, where they use their appeal to the authority of their “expertise” to justify that the public and media need not examine empirical data and claim the public should just ignore the fact that they (the public) are more receptive to data than the so-called “intellectual elites” who have controlled the levers of the Democratic Party since before the times of President Woodrow Wilson. FDR started the Ponzi scheme of social security, attempted to pack the Supreme Court, used crisis after crisis (Great Depression, WWII) to consolidate unprecedented power in the federal government, yet empirical data shows that federal involvement prolonged the depression and sucked us into a war that we didn’t have to be in. Democrats have been at the helm of many policies who’s results are deeply unpopular across partisan lines, but people aren’t connecting the dots because “acceptable discourse” doesn’t allow for the examination & scrutiny of assumptions the general public believes which are all too often rooted in the untested premise of some academic “expert”, a group whom polling has proven is more likely to vote left than even a stereotypical party line voter. You would think someone who’s career is in the study of and transmission of ideas would be more likely to have divergence from a consensus ideological viewpoint, yet data proves it is in fact the opposite. Stop voting for the party of charlatan intellectual elites who don’t abide by the very data they claim to represent. Failure to do so has resulted in the challenges millennials face today. The boomers didn’t face these challenges simply because some of the Democratic parties worst ideas (Great Society, Student loan subsidies, affirmative action, untouchable bureaucratic administrations, social security, The conceptualization of the federal reserve) had not yet had time to bear fruit.

Second, I agree with the idea of self investment. This is, and always has been, the very best hedge against inflation. For millennials like myself, the best way to avoid working in a grocery store when you’re 82 years old is to work for yourself with no intention of ever retiring. That’s not to say you don’t invest in your future, but rather to say that working for yourself will always be more profitable and therefore allow you to take more short term risk than you could working on a factory line somewhere. I had no assets or wealth well into my 30s and that has turned around rapidly in recent years. Covid has created a market of people who do not want to work crap jobs, yet who are not working for themselves either. That’s created a very great landscape for someone willing to provide services lacking in their local geography. I learned how to bake precisely because

#1. It’s fairly simple and the main requirement is direct labor rather than starting capital.

#2. every local bakery except for one closed during covid thanks to fear, relentless mandates, and a lack of innovation (local deliveries, marketing)

#3. The hours are brutal. In a climate where people have gotten used to working from home and even being paid to stay home, nobody is willing to bust their ass at 3am till the sun goes down. These conditions have allowed me to corner the local market for a good that is cheap to produce and in high demand.

#4. I intend to use the fruits of my recent success to start more small businesses in different industries to diversify my production. This way, if Uncle Sam ever imposes more regulations that cripple something I’m doing, I’m not out on my ass.

#5. convincing a bank with some smooth talk to help your first venture with a loan isn’t that tough as long as you’re not a total bum. Say what you gotta say to get the loan. If you fail, so what. This is America. File bankruptcy, save some cash, and try again.

Not all that long ago, self employment was the norm. People have grown dangerously dependent on employers IMO and the mindset being an employee cultivates stifles personal innovation, work ethic, and greatly limits your potential earnings. With automation on the rise, a general lack of work ethic in western society at large, and the defeatist attitude prevalent in society today, and horrible employee wages, the time has never been more ripe to go it on your own. Automation is eliminating the need for hired help by the minute, the amount of services available to offer that require little starting capital have never been so numerous, and marketing + shipping has never been easier. Lastly, don’t ever retire people. Studies are pretty clear that people who retire tend to die shortly after, even when they do so early. Think about it this way… you can’t name a single billionaire who’s retired, and people like the Rockefeller’s, George Soros, Donald Trump, and Warren Buffet - or even just a lifelong economist like Thomas Sowell who has written books in his 80s and 90s never seem to die do they?
This is Reddit, so I expect a lot of people to violently disagree, but that is the answer to “retirement” as a millennial. Start being self employed in an industry that requires mainly long hours and time to start rather than capital, and go from there.
The stock market will not guarantee anything because it depends on an inflation of the money supply to keep rising.

No longer are firms required to increase output via new innovations thats reduce inputs but they can simply financially engineer their stock price higher by removing the amount of shares outstanding.

Heres the problem the fed faces. They have to buy assets namely bonds, everytime their is a crash at ever higher price levels, in a nutshell guaranteeing ultra high rates of inflation because they \*buy at any price offered\*.

What they started to do in 2020 is say they will buy stock ETFs too, whats next USED CARS?

The new money finances the capital gains of the top 0.1% who now must spend a portion of their gains into the 'real economy' which is in a state of collapse. From this you get a crappy miami home selling for $50 million for example while the median wage is like $12 per hour.

Now because the US economy is radically restructered and has moved away from production and into consumption 'post-industrial' service, if you stop the bailouts of the 0.01% \*without\* simultaneously re-inflating the productive economy you risk descending into leftist fascism.

All the minions/yuppies/metrosexuals who serve the 0.1% would be out of work and suddenly you would see these nutcases joining radicalized political parties. The german SA swelled to 400-500k in the early 30's, primarily made up of all the people who lost their nominal wealth on the stock market.

The current US economic demographics:  
0.1% approx 300,000 people at the top of the feudal structure, this narrows even more to about 400 families that own the majority of the financial wealth in the country. Forbes 400  


5% Yuppies/minions/metrosexuals. These are the 'servants' of the top 0.1% They are the managers of the banks, lawyers, plastic surgeons, economists, fund managers etc. This group is clinically insane and composes roughly 10-15 million people. \*\*When this group gets radicalized the political structure of the country changes.\*\*

20-25% - middle class. These are generally higher salaried laborers, agriculture, the leftovers of industry etc. This is probably the only group that is physically producing enough wealth for the country to consume. This group is rapidly shrinking.

70% - This is the majority who are unable to function properly to even make it through the day. Many used to be the 'middle class' but now find themselves in 'working poor'. They are generally hired for the use of their limbs in some mediocre 'service'. The cognitive skills of this group have collapsed. They are generally politically impotent however can be riled up. They dont have the will due to immense addictions to substances, pornography, wasting time pursing frivilous ends.  


The technological innovation that is rapidly slowing is no longer benefiting everyone but instead is being used by the 0.1% to tighten their control over the rest. They want a zero-growth neo-feudal society.
My next band name... ""The Dead Millennials""
I disagree. As long as you don’t have children I think it’s very possible. Two married adults with adult incomes who are frugal and live a FIRE type lifestyle. I don’t think never is the correct word.


But for anyone who doesn’t live like that, yes, very likely they won’t

Doom mongering anticapilatist bullshit.

Median electrician salary is $51,000

Education to become one averages about 5k over 2 years.

51k with a 10% yearly 401k contribution is 5k a year.

From age 23 to full social security age (67) is 44 years.

5k a year for 44 years at 7% return 
(10% return minus inflation)

1.3 million dollars.
I'm a member of a union. We have a very healthy retirement fund for our pensions along with matched 401. Our bennies are also on top of pay, not subtracted like most employers do. We also do very well on takehome pay with our journeymen making over 41 an hour with negotiations for another 12 in the mix. Out east they do ever better. I will have no problems retiring. 

That said, what op stated is a very real problem for the vast majority of Americans, hell I remember them throwing around turning military pensions into 401ks.
I already knew that about me. I was born poor and I’m probably going to die poor. At least I have a family history of heart condition cause I might get taken out before I’m 70. Which would low key be a blessing
The best advice at the bottom is what my father thought me when I was a kid.... and it is on point! 

The less you know how to do for yourself , the harder your life is going to be!

 It rings true then and it rings true today!

Nobody can take your skills and knowledge away from you! Become an asset, not a liability! 

Don't believe me?

What would the Kardashians do if they went broke? Hooking?
I agree and I also fear that the last age group too retire would be anyone in there forties now. Everyone one else is screwed if you haven’t made your plan. Social security won’t even exist anymore. The us will be in so much debt that if you haven’t saved your own money you be stuck with nothing.
I wonder about this often.

A friend of my wife's, this chick is 37 years old and still pursuing her bachelor's degree in journalism (lol, the fuck).  She is a bartender at a shitty chain hotel and she basically lives in a hovel.  Also, she has no car, and no prospects.  She rents a crappy shoebox apartment for I believe $950 a month.[

What happens to her?  In 10, 20, 30 years from now?  Is she to be near 70 years old, still being a career waitress for the rest of her life living check to check?
Your conception of capital gains is deeply flawed. There isn’t a fixed pie, where some people get more of the pie and others get less. The pie grows over time.

As people create products and services that add value to the total economy (typically measured in terms of GDP), that value is accounted for in terms of the equivalent fiat currency, which is how we measure capital gains. Now, currency inflation can undermine the value of the currency and inflate the perceived valuation of the company stocks, but a growing stock market represents a real growth in the total production of the economy relative to the population size. That’s what is meant by “growth per capita.”

So everyone gets a piece of a growing pie. If the economic pie never outgrows the population growth, then we would still be living in the Stone Age.

It cannot be a Ponzi scheme. Otherwise why would it fail only now, after many generations of people happily retiring? You would think it would collapse after one generation if that’s how it worked.

But there is a catch to all of this. The stock market growth model relies on perpetual economic growth. And that should be achievable unless something catastrophic completely halts the economy for a long period of time. The only downside is that, so far, all of this extraordinary economic growth over the last few centuries has depended on burning fossil fuels for energy, which is not sustainable.
You will if you can diamond hand a few shares of GME.  That’s my out of this fucking rat race.
I've saved this so I can read it every night before I drift off into nightmares.
 Lovely piece, friend, and a beacon of hopelessness that I will cherish for as long as I can remember to.
There aren’t any solid Investments at all? Nothing else that can be done? What about getting old you can’t grow good if you’re sick
Even when crypto is down I will always throw $10 here and there because what else dumb shit would I throw $10 at! $20 for a sandwich to have it delivered? If I lose it fine. I just have to watch it die but if it wins… 3% or better than it’s worth cashing out as much as any certificate or better I can pay into on my wages. Stock market sucks and it’s gambling but it is the best way to pay for a haircut or a flight in states or to just supplement bills for me right now as a student barely making bills right now… let alone retirement.
Nice, solid piece. Thank you OP.

Thank you thank you thank you for clarifying that younger Boomers do not get the same benefits as older ones.

Your advice is right on. It wasn’t until I lost my last full time job in 2017 and was forced to simplify my lifestyle that I realized I could live on much less. I live in a rural area so I recognize that it was easier than for many.
You are wrong on a few things about stocks .
Corporations that grow their earning will grow their valuation which will bring a rise in its stock price. This is not a suckers buy stock trade off type company .
Not all companies paying dividends are profitable .
Those that are not will see their dividend decline or disappear . Companies that do not grow and expand will have a difficult time seeing the share price rise . 
There is a difference between fundamental value and stock price . Learning and understanding fundamentals is a good thing so you know which stocks to select . 
Plenty of millennials will retire earlier than boomers and lots will retire at the same age . Let’s not assume all boomers will be able to retire .
It’s up to you as an individual to invest and be smart with your money . First things first . Get your housing situation under control . You can own or you can be in control of the place you live at . Have a room mate or 2 if need be depending on the size of the place . 
Managing a rental situation can be done and yes it can be a pain in the ass but once you get your housing situation under control then investing becomes easier .
Well, that’s just, like, your opinion, man.
The solution is to just not work. Bring this system to it’s knees. Because it doesn’t work.
The 1920’s and 1930’s have turned into the 2020’s and 2030’s. The Great Depression showed some significant resiliency in Americans and others. Humans will always find a way to survive, as a whole.
As long as corporations keep earning money shareholders’ equity will grow. You can step back from the cliff, those dire predictions have been around for ages. The stock market is in a constant state of adjustment, excesses will self correct.
Jokes on you, I’m suicidal and plan to retire when I choose, I’m not staying around to prop up a dying empire looking for the nearest fascist dictator we can hand the keys of power to, not my future
I will get to retire.
We can all retire next year and have a completely ""passive income economy"" that allows everyone to be part of the Fuel Production Industry.

[The Hydrogen Economy has a lot of benefits,](http://H2space.org) we just have to choose to make the change.
Speak for yourself
A large portion of millennials retirement plan will be suicide.
You have shown that you do not fundamentally understand how equity markets work.
Oh boy, we got a doomsday forecast here 😂 I see positive real returns for stocks but over really long terms.  In other words, society has given corporations their money for innovative products and services throughout history despite wars and upheavals. 

But if the population declined and less money was available for stocks and other assets then it would not be good for the economy.
I'm a millennial and I already retired... 35yo, 14 years in the trades, went from 84 hour weeks to doing nothing. Starve the burners out.
Great discussion and spot on takeaway. Self-sufficiency is critical to survival and contrary to socialist values.
I bet you’re fun at parties
Crypto baby…VeChain
I think you are missing one part of capital gains vs dividends.

In sectors that are stagnant, you'll find more dividends than capital gains largely because there is no where for the company to reinvest and grow.

For growing sectors, profits not paid out in dividends are instead invested into building another factory or hiring more people to do more work. It doesn't necessarily mean the company isnt healthy if this happens.

The ponzi scheme part comes in when investors have expectations of growth. Tesla earnings per share(eps) are so high because people think that their reinvestment will result in so much growth that the current price is actually cheap. That's the pond scheme. Impressions of growth.
Problem is mostly that Americans love debt. You go into debt to buy a house, buy a car and worst of all on a 25% interest rate credit card a bunch of garbage you don't even need. If you buy a house at 30 years old it will be paid off at 60 years old. How many 60 year olds do you see with the house paid off?
There are Major flaws in your theory, mainly you assume boomers cash out their stock. For a number of reasons this is untrue... first the old paradigm of moving from stocks to bonds as you age is dead. If your retire at 65 and plan to live to 85 you better be invested in stocks or you are going to outlive your money supply. Second most established boomers have learned to live minimally and want to give back to their families and future generations the best way to do this is through inheritance of assets, typically stock. Third of 56% of Americans own stock with 43% held by individuals 65+ and 72% held but individuals aged 55+ so as you can plainly see most millennials are not invested leaving plenty of room and capital to invest.. not to mention the top 10% of earners own 70% of the stock. 

You are retarded, and worse yet fear-mongering. As you intelligently pointed out there is .00000001% chance the US economy will collapse and if it does you have way bigger problems then where you are going to invest your money..
I knows a bunch that are on the right track but they aren’t victims like most millennials
Good read. Ty
I’m 28 and confident I’ll retire with dignity (60k in 401k, thanks Biden) Idk why Reddit is showing me this cynical subreddit.
Property and gold.
Don’t waste your time reading this
I don’t know what this post is going on about, but entire generations of people are pretty diverse. I stopped reading when you generalized us all.

So then I went back and read more, and I just feel like you are living in some conspiracy fueled alternate reality. 

It’s like this person never lived through the housing crash or Bernie Madoff or Enron or the dot com bubble or heard of the Great Recession or read The Grapes of Wrath or learned about the fall of the Roman Empire or or or … 

“What do you think would happen to the average person when they see their pensions and stock holdings evaporate?” 

Dude, we already know. It’s already happened. You are an ignorant mansplainer. Jesus. 

This guy is literally is just regurgitating things he reads/hears, and he thinks he is the first to yell: the sky is falling!
Fast forward 30-40 years from now.  Who owns most of the assets?  Baby boomers will all be dead, inheritances will be passed into the millennials, and they’ll have more than enough wealth to retire.  This cycle happens for every generation.  Power and wealth are reserved for the eldest generations.  Be patient, your time will come
Some millennials will. Wife and I have put in 15% to our 401ks from day 1. Even when we struggled to pay for gas and could afford to put meat on the table starting with 35,000 in debt for wifes school. We struggled for some time. But fast forward 12 years. We are doing great. Wife lost a job in the middle of it but was able to jump right back in the game with a new career path. We should be able to theoretically retire in 18 year when we both hit 55. But we have a lot of worries about health care. For now we save and hope for the best.
Well, fuck you. I plan on it and I’m one!!
There is going to be cheap goods and services ongoing…..actual costs will be deflated ……but prices on the. Will rise from inflation.  Example :  houses used to be made from bricks and stone and 12” spaced wall studs ( my home wall studs are redwood and still arrow straight after 60 yeats.   Now new housing is plastic wrap and paper, or cheap stucco.  The same “product” - ie housing, is way way cheaply made, but priced higher. ( while product is same use/ purpose, but will not have same life span).   The product is cheaper realatively,     These electric cars are relatively cheaper today, but they will not have same economic useful life and will be much much more expense as they will likely have limited economic life down the line,
Probably because they don’t know how to work!
We are doomed
Millennials have a great chance to retire with BTC & crypto. That gives us a better chance at retirement than many other generations, tbh. If ppl don’t plan for their future, then yeah, they’re gonna be fucked.
If they work hard enough they will
Disagree just don’t rely on the government. I won’t retire as early as I would like but it certainly is attainable by early 50s and I don’t make a crazy salary.
To change the rules, you must first master them. Hang tough coco puff.
Alaska.

No state income tax.

No state sales tax (except in larger towns and cities have a small tax).

No property taxes (except in larger towns and cities like Anchorage, which has higher than average property taxes.

Plus, you get the Alaska dividend, a state fund built on oil revenues.

And, you can hunt for food.
How about a nice tent. The future of housing.

If you get a remote job, even a low paid one, you can do it.
Would our generation (assuming you are a millennial) support the crash whole heartedly and not demand a bail out though? Can you stay logical if you retirement fund vaporized? This is why an upward crash is preferable for governments. It is to fool everyone thinking everything is great when it is not.

Without going into too much detail, without significant economic restructuring, there is absolutely no way things would get better. My generation has become a bunch of gamblers who is relying on the stock market and crypto to make money. Just look at who is buying up Dogecoin, GME and Tesla? Millennials. You know, when investment advices from frauds like Elon Musk is taken seriously and Musk himself being worshipped. The economy is beyond saving. We are in late stage capitalism so things can definitely stay linear until capitalism is disposed of entirely.

>And people pulling money out of a bubble like that doesn’t result in inflation. Historically, it results in a massive crash that’s followed by deflation.

That's because the central banks aren't printing to support the market.
it’s important to recognize that history going up and down does not mean it inevitably will go back up.
WWII ended the Great Depression.
The stock market can go up forever, so long as the population continues to grow. There will always be some natural inflation associated with population growth. As the sum of societal value grows and the number of things with which to invest in multiplies, there will always be room for more investors. The root of growth in the first place is human capital. Without human capital, humanity would still be at a poverty rate of 100% like back in the Stone Age if we were even still alive as a species. So long as the amount of humans available to create human capital grows, and so long as our technological improvements in society facilitate improved use of human capital, there is no quantifiable limit to how big the market can grow. If the market ever stops growing, it will almost certainly herald the extinction of our species - or at the very least indicate that some disaster or another has sent us back to the Bronze Age.
I am so happy to see this post. Too much doom and gloom on Reddit. It makes people complacent.
You can have high inflation rates in food and deflation in other stuff. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and that basket is different for each person. For example, the CPI basket might be deflationary for a rich person who spends most of his money on luxury watches and inflationary for a poor person with food making up most of the spending. Hence the CPI is a bad indicator for inflation.
Institutions were behind bitcoin.
GenX here as well.  

My great grandparents worked on their farm until they died.

My grandparents had a second home outside of the city for weekends, and retired on pensions.

My parents retired on pensions and inheritance years ago, are currently in their 70s, and their 50th wedding anniversary plans next year involve a cruise in Europe.

We recently bought a farm, where we hope to be able to work until we die, if we can afford to.

Our kids' futures look grim.
It seems like the crypto experts  really want you to invest in their electronic block chain tool to stabilize the demand. Crypto is a mechanism, not an investment in tangibles.
You gotta do a song called ""Holiday in New York""
Children are the only way people can retire.  


Who exactly do you think is going to be ensuring that your 'income' has any purchasing power if there is nobody creating wealth or even basics for you to buy?
Provided you don't depend on the stock market for income. Then yes.
I have one child to a cunt of a whore. What are my chances of ever retiring?

Stocks aren’t a Ponzi scheme. I could say crypto is more apt to what they’re describing. The fundamental value of a share is the projected future cash flows of the company divided by the # of shares in that company. That’s it. If companies expect more business and evidence supports it then prices go up and vice versa. WOW

Couple of problems though, highest crime rate in the entire nation and when you need a hospital it's a mere hour and 45 minutes away by airplane.  Unless it's snowing.  At which point it's a mere week and a half a way.

I’m a young millenial/ almost gen z. And I think some of your assumptions are fair but some of your understanding of capitalism isn’t correct. If you’re a communist (since you think we need to completely get rid of capitalism), you’re probably just not going to agree with anything I say but it is what it is. Due to human nature, inflation/deflation and depressions follow cycles. Capitalism didn’t die in 1929 during the last depression and it’s not dying now. I’m surprised you see the issue of government/ the Fed not allowing the free market to deleverage yet still think this is capitalism failing. There’s a depression with deflation and deleveraging about once in the average person’s lifespan due to people taking on too much risk and thinking it can never happen again bc it’s been so long since the last one and they weren’t alive. You could argue this is a product of capitalism to an extent, but more than anything, it’s just human nature (and there’s no system that could produce a good economy and stop this from happening). Our system with govt and Fed thinks they can stop it but they’ve only made it worse. Govt doesn’t help these things. In-between those cycles is inflation (70s/80s). It’s cyclical and follows a pattern that’s easy to see (due to, again human nature such as demographics). This cycle has also been elongated and made worse due to the govt/ Fed. If not for the Fed and bailouts, we’d had a terrible depression in ‘08 but we’d be in an actually booming economy rn, regardless of COVID (not this BS boom they’re claiming) and good to go for decades to come. You can see the private debt from 1929 until now and how it began to deleverage in ‘08 for the first time since 1929 (https://d1yhils6iwh5l5.cloudfront.net/charts/resized/21477/normal/el_chart.png). The graph doesn’t show it but after that dip in ‘08, private debt is almost as high as before (thank artificially low int rates as well as govt spending/adding debt). The free market (aka no central bank ran by govt and real money like gold) would have never let this amount of debt build up and it would have deleveraged and gotten rid of shitty companies that aren’t earning money and therefore aren’t able to pay good wages.

People seeing things linearly, instead of cyclically, is also why we get over-valued and under-valued stock for long periods. After the dot com boom the last 3 decades, people start to discount CFs at the same rate. The dame thing happened at the end of the 1920s. They think innovation will continue at this rate but it won’t. They think internet stocks are still the new technology and ready to boom when the technology is actually a bit old (same w/ railroads earlier). (Innovation is also cyclical). So they continue to buy v expensive stock thinking the past will be like the future. The opposite happened after the Great Dep. After that, people were horrified to put their money into the stock market, even though stocks were extremely cheap and we had a booming economy. This is why stocks went sideways for 10+ years after 1933. People focused on the past instead of seeing that history is cyclical and the future isn’t always like the past. Look how quickly we went from railroads to cars to airplanes to being in the moon!! It was thought by many that flying a plane was impossible only 70 years before we made it on the moon! Look at the price of stocks over time, the amount of gold mined. Did you know 2/3 of the world entire gold supply has been mined this century? After 5,000 years of using it as money, still 2/3 were mined in only 100 years. History is exponential, not linear. Innovations build on top of each other.

Also, I’m not saying the govt won’t stop the market from falling and millenials/ gen z won’t scream for more big govt. The govt can do this, at least to an extent, if they’re able to make inflation in the real economy, which I believe they will. But even if the govt makes inflation in the real economy and bypasses the natural deflation, the market will still lose immense value in real terms and imo, drop 85% as it usually does during this time of the cycle. My main point was they can’t keep the stock market from falling down without inflation in the real economy. But idk ab some bank bailouts. Imo, the banks still aren’t that safe bc the govt didn’t let any fail (and write off debts) so they all still have nearly as much debts and leverage. It’s not like they can just write off debts and be safe without any consequences so it’s not the banks fault for not deleveraging more, per se; it’s the govts for not allowing them to fail so their debts can be defaulted. I think there would be riots this time around if govt tried to bail out a bank again. Maybe it won’t matter and I don’t think it will. But if it did and they let a bank fail, that’d scream deflation, maybe even more than 1929, bc a WAY higher % of banks would fail this time than 1929. Idk, everything is in the hands of the govt now as far as inflation/deflation goes

And yeah, the gambling thing is another unfortunate unintended consequence of govt policies. Due to how much regulation there is and how much companies have to pay staff to regulate, it doesn’t make sense for them to take on accounts unless the person has quite a decent net worth. This leads to, as you said, those people who don’t have enough money to be accepted by a professional broker, deciding to hop on robinhood and buy household names without having a clue what they’re really doing. It’s unfortunate and they’ll lose a lot of money but after this depression, real wages will go up a lot and real price of stock will be cheap compared to wages. So it may suck for millennials to lose 85% in the market but they’re still working and most still have the majority of their life’s future wages to put into the market at cheap prices. I know they’ll probably do the opposite but, hopefully the govt is forced to get to rid of a ton of regulations so these companies can make a profit by taking on smaller clients. (Houses will also drop ~50% in real terms and not come back up again. That’s what happens when you support a deleveraging housing bubble by a THIRD of the US MBSs instead of letting it deleverage naturally, you just create a new bubble, that’s almost just as big. So that will be helpful for any millennials who do not own a house yet).

Also, central bank printing isn’t necessarily printing. It only goes into assets unless they work with the govt. Like doing QE to buy MBS’s just artificially pushes up housing prices, not food or anything in the real economy. And no, like I said, John Locke and his central bank did do these things. He helped create a central bank, held artificially low interest rates, and bought up a ton of stock to artificially push prices up. It went 10x in a year or 2 then came roaring more than 10x down within a few months. At a certain point, people start to worry about valuations and bubbles. And you wrong out of suckers willing to pay ridiculous prices. And once it stops going up and the first person pulls their money out, it avalanches QUICKLY. You should read a book on bubbles/ human nature of bubbles (if you haven’t already). They’re all pretty interesting and give really good insight as to what’s happened in the past, how bubbles form, and how they pop
Yes you are correct. 

But to be honest there is no perfect way to measure inflation, as there is a debate whether real estate should be included or not. 

Your example about a golden watch is a good one, however a golden watch (surprise surprise) is an asset that appreciates in price over time, like real estate. 

CPI is not perfect, and frankly speaking I don't like it, but including overvalued assets into calculation is not an option either. 

In my personal opinion RE should be added into CPI.

You can't predict the future using past historical data when there are so many fundamental differences in society and the economy. Here are some of the differences.

Back in the old days the financial economy isn't as big as it is right now. Just look at how big this giant stock market casino has become. Fun fact, did you know that there is 1 quadrillion dollars worth derivatives traded in market? Our economy has completely become financialized and letting it deleverage will cost the real economy greatly. Everyone including the elites know this and they will not want a deleverage since most of their wealth are tied to financials and it will evaporate as well. Financials are too big to fail.

Our generation have mostly relying on gambling in the stock market and crypto to get rich instead of trying to find a good paying job that doesn't exist. That has probably never happened in the past and it is only made possible by government intervention. At this point you would probably say free market capitalism would prevent this. But let's not go off topic here since it was never my intention to turn this thread into a capitalism vs socialism topic.

>My main point was they can’t keep the stock market from falling down without inflation in the real economy

Keeping the inflation in the stock market/crypto market is totally possible when you deal with a generation that is as ignorant and foolish like ours. Ever heard of the memes, diamond hands and hodl? For example, hodl on to Bitcoin because it can go to 1 million. GME holders have diamond hands, GME to 1k. It is as if holding a stock or crypto forever is a good thing even when the prices drops. Nobody would be willing to sell since they know it will eventually go back up. In fact they would buy more. So long as the our generation keeps dumping money into these assets, inflation will be kept stable. Add all those bullshit social media influencers and financial con artists like Musk pumping up prices and you get a mania that defies all logical sense.

Deleveraging means a generation would have to suffer and would our generation be willing to take the bullet and sacrifice ourselves? Probably not. Since human beings are all selfish creatures. Most of us hate the boomers for being selfish but deep down we are all kindred spirits.
It doesn't really matter that you can build different CPI indexes with different weighted items.

The main thing which matters is to which CPI the debt is linked to

I’m only half kidding.
Sorry this is so long lol.

I can’t use the past to predict the future? Like at all? I can’t predict we’ll still have Fall, Summer, Spring, and Summer in a hundred years? Just bc it’ll be a totally different Earth. I couldn’t look at how interest rates have followed a cycle the last couple hundred years and have predicted that they’d continue the pattern and fall further down  before getting to near 0 (which they did in both 1929 and 2008)? And I couldn’t draw any similarities b/w that signaling the debt bubble was over since people couldn’t take on more debt since int rates can’t go lower? It’s not just cycles, it’s reasoning that creates cycles. Every major event, the economy is much different than the past economy 50+ years ago. And yes, some things are slightly different in how the occur (for example, we can sustain more debt now than before due to the technology and perpetual inflation), so it’d be wrong to predict the exact same debt levels as the tipping points yet there’s still a point where there’s too much debt and 2+2 still equals 4.

Here’s an example of a cycle. Naturally, inflation follows demographics due to spending patterns. I’m not following some random patterns I see. I’m following cycles based on facts. I.e. The boomers made high inflation in the 60s/70s because they were under 18. A population heavily young is inflationary bc you spend money on them and they don’t contribute anything. In ‘07, there were a ton of boomers that were 47 and a huge drop off on ones that were 46 and under. 47 is when people spend the most money. The boomers are such a huge demographic that they inflated the housing market just like the inflated consumer goods. Then BOOM! From being a ton of 47 year olds in the US, to quite a bit less and continuing to decline a lot year by year, the housing market collapsed along with stocks. We went from 4 million 47 year olds in 1998 to 4.8 million in 2006 to 4 million in 2013. We had a bubble of people near or at peak spending age the same time we had a housing bubble. The peak spending age used to be much lower due to lower life spans but if you understand the reasoning, you know how to adjust data and reasoning to a slightly different scenario. (And if QE didn’t step in, we would have had deflation since we had so many less people spending money.) These trends were based off of history and if you saw the patterns, you could understand the reasoning and draw conclusions. I don’t follow patterns. I follow reasoning which give me patterns. You can’t ignore the past and just say it’s not the exact thing so we literally can’t learn a single thing from it. Would those demographics have told me everything that would happen? Hell no! But would that have given me a great understanding as to where the economy would be going and why it might be hard for us to get inflation? Hell yes!

Ah, yes, the 1 quadrillion derivative market. Yes, I’m very aware, it’s something like that, at least 500 trillion, it’s so big that no one really knows lol. But, that’s exactly my point in why I’m saying the banks are still too leveraged and will fail if govt lets the free economy run and may STILL fail even if govt tries to save them. Look at the losses the banks took from a family owned hedge funds the other week! That’s how leveraged they are and how much DAMN DEBT there is! This is exactly my point when I say history is cyclical. There is too much debt and it needs to deleverage and it’s trying to. (The debt follows the spending peaks/ age demographics in the long-run btw. Bc people buy houses and have amounts of debt at certain ages more than other ages. You occasionally get hiccups in the short-term like QE steeping in.) But nothing is too big to fail bc anything can fail. What happens if that derivative market stops to burst? Do govts around the world print hundreds of trillions to save the banks? The govts can’t guarantee anything. They may try to guarantee everything but in doing so, they will sacrifice the dollar (which I think they will) and that will lead to them having guaranteed nothing. Either scenario, the stock market tanks in real terms. Honestly, tanks much worse under a hyper-inflationary scenario (which I think is unlikely but possible).

If you think a bubble can grow forever in real terms, then it makes sense why you don’t want to look at history. I really don’t mean offense, but that’s so absurd and denies so much logic. It’s not just that history proves otherwise, it’s that it denies logic for the stock market to go up forever (w/out inflation in the real economy) and be priced at literally anything possible and no one would rather put more of their money in other places that are priced more fairly, such as just starting your own business where you can get justified CFs. The stock market is heavy but it’s still not as expensive as the dot-com bubble and it’s rivaling 1929 rn. So it’s not like we have these new type of valuations that we’ve never seen in history. We have, and it ended in a crash within less than a year both times. Again, look up John Locke. People were buying swamp land in the Mississippi without even going to America and thinking they were buying amazing pristine land. The central bank kept buying to artificially push up prices while guaranteeing artificially low int rates and people kept buying bc the prices is always going up. Tell me how buying swamp land thinking it’s pristine amazing land (bc the price is going up a ton) is different than buying a random shit company bc people on reddit tell you too. Or I’m sure you’re familiar with the tulip bubble? One bud got up to an average working man’s 10 year salary before crashing to practically 0. You think those people weren’t ignorant and foolish? These aren’t the exact same scenarios but can you not see similarities and predict similar outcomes? Everyone in history has always wanted to get rich quick without working and that’s how they get sucked into bubbles. Maybe this bubble lasts longer than I think but it’ll pop.

Yeah, there’s a bunch of dumb money in the stock market rn, that’s generally what happens near the end of a bubble. Look how much dumb money has flowed in since the stimmy checks. This wasn’t happening anywhere to this extent beforehand and it signals we’re near a top (in real terms). The last people put their money in and “household name” stocks do much better than valuation stocks. Sure, tons of millennials put money into bad things but those are more likely to be people with much less money (on avg) than those who use professional bokers to handle their money. And brokers can’t always identify bubbles and they screw up a lot but they at least know and understand valuations and financial statements. The vast majority of the money in the market is from people who understand finance, not millennials using robinhood.

And yeah, deleveraging means someone would have to go through pain. But short-term pain for long-term growth is better than the perpetual no growth economy we have and Japan’s had since they went into their coma QE infinite economy 30 years ago. (But I agree, good luck convincing the voters!) Either way, the economy will have to deleverage in some sense (in terms of debt to gdp). Again, to deny this would be to deny not just history, but logic. Maybe we don’t get deflation and a ton of defaults to deleverage it. Maybe we get decent/really high inflation that wipes out a lot of debt along with some defaults. But we already started to deleverage in ‘08. The ceiling for private debt has been met and it’s not getting much, if any, higher than that. And I agree, I don’t think we will allow deflation. I think we’ll get very high inflation and the market may never go down in nominal terms (but it has to go down in real terms)
In finance, past performance tends to be the best indicator of future results.
Greetings. 

So how would you interpret current debt in US and EU in relation to CPI? Do you have some interesting thoughts? Projection of sorts? 

Thanks.
Look I agree with the perspective,

But it's all relative, you have better education, better Healthcare system, better housing conditions. You could argue you don't need such a high level of services and you are not willing to pay for them, and in some way you are forced to consume them due to regulation or government decisions, as well as geography conditions (e.g. it got very expensive for the average American to live in the big city centers)

Re Housing - The cheap money ecosystem definitely makes it much harder for those who are not on the wheel. And since the land got so expensive in demand areas, it makes it less economic to build ""cheap"" housing on them. But on the other hand the money is so cheap that you can lock today a fixed mortgage which costs as much as the long term inflation goal e.g. 2%. That's free money. It's also a big game changer in the case of a mega crisis with hyper inflation.

The deformation in the market due to the low interest rates is definitely giving the tone these days
Making portable housing more viable doesn’t sound like a bad idea at all to me
This is why I suggested an upward crash in my first post. The stock market can never be deleveraged in real terms. So technically it can go up forever.

Deleveraging through defaulting on the debt is out of the question when the entire global economy is financialized. Currency devaluation is the only way out. But after the currency devaluation what's stopping the government from continuing to support the stock market? The bubble can be reflated easily.

>And brokers can’t always identify bubbles

It means they are equally as screwed as the Robinhood traders. Ever heard of the Greenspan put? These brokers are academically trained to front run the market whenever they hear that the Fed is going to support it. FOMO is a powerful tool and with the government pumping money into the market, it could make the impossible possible.

>The vast majority of the money in the market is from people who understand finance, not millennials using robinhood.

Which is why we are screwed either way. These academically brain washed brokers will always act how the central bankers want them to.

The tulips bubble failed to reflate because it is just tulips and there is zero use to it beside selling it to a greater fool. For stocks however, people believe they are equity instruments (but how ironic they have become the same ponzi scheme through capital gains). People will always keep buying them if they believe it would go up eventually. Hence all the front running by brokers.

The government can always prime the pump because the younger generation like ours are easily manipulated. Just have social media influencers and financial advisors shill stocks and the masses will just hop onto it. Social media doesn't even exist back in the old days. If someone like Elon Musk exist back in the 1900s, he wouldn't be able to shill a dodgy investment like dogecoin to millions of people without twitter. At most he would reach tens of thousands with the old media. This means less people would be convinced to buy back the stocks and preventing bubbles. This is why I say you cannot use past data to determine future human behavior. 

I hate to say this, but the younger generation are getting dumber and dumber as time progresses. Just look at the people posting ""loss porn"" at wallstreet bets. Would such a thing even exist back in the 1900s in radios and newspaper? Celebrating a loss LOL.
Hi there,

Well first in order to clarify my point - the CPI index which the debt is linked to concludes the total cost of money along with the interest. 

So for example if I took a mortgage which is linked to the price of coffee, I wouldn't care if the price of apples rose or dropped (If I have used tea instrad of apples though it might have been different ;)
Another example - When I buy a house from a developer, and pay a down payment of 20% say, the rest of the 80% paid at the end of the term may be linked to a CPI index which follows the cost of building materials. 


Re your question - I wish I had a magic ball to tell me what is going to happen lol. There is no written theory for what is happening right now.

But here are several points:
1. unhealthy levels of debt prevents growth if you are unable to serve it. For example. After ww1, when Germany were forced to pay penalties which shot their debt to GDP up, they ended up printing money to try to serve the debt, ending up in hyper inflation (This story is more complicated than described, as the Germans got a negative incentive to work, ending up in a declining GDP while debt kept rising).

On one hand debt has a negative effect on prices as it restrains demand. On the other hand high government debt may be a reason to expand QE and keep interest rates low, possibly resulting in inflation.

2. Although the Debt to GDP ratio is very high in many countries, it is still serve-able, especially when interest rates are low. But as government spending keep shooting the debt higher, it might get more difficult in certain countries.

3. The money velocity dropped to super low levels. It has began to pick up a bit lately, and if this continues it may alarm that inflation is coming, as the money base has expanded significantly and won't retract easily.

If I needed to make a bet I would argue that inflation is the course out of such a situation. Hence it might be a good thing to have some fixed rate debt which you can serve.
Yes, the stock market can go up forever in terms of dollars, but it can’t go up at this pace forever in real terms. Venezuela’s stock market has gone up infinitely in terms of their currency yet it’s lost over 99% in real terms. When there’s a collapse in the market, in real terms (whether through inflation or deflation), people will be horrified to put money into the market just as every other massive economic downturn combined with bubble in history. If inflation happened, ppl will hold a ton of gold for the next few decades. If deflation happened, ppl will hold safe bonds and cash (maybe gold/silver, depending on people’s mindsets towards them as a monetary unit). German citizens bought a ton of gold after their hyper-inflation. US citizens held a ton of bonds, cash, and gold/silver after our deflationary spiral.

The FOMO of the stock market is a classic bubble. And it’s happened multiple times in history and has been much worse before. It’s classic human nature, we love bubbles. When it crashes (in real terms) and doesn’t come back up (in real terms), human nature again says we will have a mindset shift and be horrified to put money into stocks. All Central banks in the world would have to do hundreds of trillions in QE to pull the markets back up. And will people be ok with that? Will there not be riots and guillotines at DC? Will people not say fuck the dollar and go to gold or btc? There’s no way they can stop the market from crashing in real terms. If they stop it from crashing in terms of dollars, it’ll still crash in real terms. People can be dumb but if their stocks are going up 5% a year and inflation is 25% a year, they know they’re losing money. Idc what the Fed does, they can’t keep it growing in real terms at this rate forever. Whenever it’s gotten to these levels, it’s dropped 85%+ in real terms.

Yeah, I agree people are taught that the Fed will solve all of their problems and they believe it. They’re in for a rude awakening and there will be a mind-sight shift when they failed to realize the housing bubble and failed to actually solve it and only inflated newer bigger bubbles. People will lose faith in the Fed and the stock market. People didn’t lose faith after the dotcom bubble bc the economy was still doing alright and the housing market was starting to bubble. There’s no new bubble they can re-inflate this time and the economy won’t be anything like after the dot-com bubble.

Less people in the bubble. I suppose to an extent, but there were shoe shining boys recommending stocks to brokers such as JFK’s dad and that’s how he knew the top was in and sold everything immediately. There have always been people who love to get into bubbles. And the amount of people that are able to get into bubbles has increased exponentially over time. There were exponentially more people in the 2000 dotcom bubble than the 1929 bubble and exponentially more people in the 1929 bubble than the 1840s bubble etc etc. There’s an higher % of the population participating in each new bubble of history and that doesn’t change human nature. But the amount of people doesn’t matter when I’m talking about an individual’s human nature. If a single person loses (almost) all of their money in stocks, they’re likely to not want to participate any more (at least in the same way or to the same extent as before). If they see everyone else losing their ass too, they’ll be even less likely (and vice versa i.e. if everyone is getting rich buying doge, why not buy doge? It can only go up). What happens when they lose their house and life savings? Will some people continue to gamble bc they feel like they have nothing anyways, sure. Most will get out and stay out.

I think there’s something your forgetting when your saying stocks aren’t tulips and people can buy them no matter what. Companies go under. My view is that there’s going to be massive bankruptcies and once your stock company declares bankruptcy, the stock collapses. It’s as worthless as a tulip. What happens when the smart money leaves TSLA and doesn’t want to go back in? That thing would drop 80% while the rest of the market has only dropped 30%. All the millennials who had their life savings in their will never touch the stock market w/out a professional again and may never touch it again regardless.

Were you around for the dotcom bubble? I was too young but I’ve read a lot and all the euphoria your comparing to today seems like it was worse back then. The valuations were definitely worse.
I was only 6 when the dot com bubble popped in 01. But I have heard my fair share of stories of what happened from both socialists and libertarians economist.

Millennials will keep piling onto stocks. It is the only way for them to make money. I have to strongly emphasize this. Just look at the real economy out there. Unlike the economy back in the old days it is more distorted than ever before. Zombie corporations are everywhere and dodgy ones like Tesla which only makes a profit by trading BTC. Like I said, this economy is beyond saving and without a crash which the government doesn't want let it happen. No one can make money by getting a job. Stocks are the only way to get an income besides stimulus. We have become a generation of gamblers.

OP has added some important context here in regards to economic collapse.
[deleted]
I do not understand why economists and “real estate market experts” are doubling down on “this market is totally not a bubble” stand point. There are a lot of people in foreclosure protection and I don’t see the government extending a helping hand any more. This is a big bubble and it has to burst soon. It has to. Same with rental. Rents are way up and eviction moratoriums are running out. People can’t pay the thousands of dollars to get out of the problem. So it’s all gotta collapse.  All of it. Good thing there’s an employment shortage!  Maybe things will equal out during the 2021/2022 financial collapse. 

Great OP

This looks like one of those crazy ass GME posts, I thought by the end you were going to tell us that we can save the world by buying GME lol.
“and its role...YES
Just shut the fuck up, would you?  I haven’t had my joe yet since I’m currently in PST time zone, but I can confirm with 100% certainty that nothing is going to collapse, and life will go on with or without you!

Well Jerome Powell is definitely a key player here. I’ve thought they were purposely going to crash the dollar for a while. In order to prepare to plummet the world’s major economies into severe depression while also using the media to prompt a civil war. This would be a measure of artificially imposed extinction. People think the elite want more people because more people equals more consumers but at this point a critical mass has been reached where the multinational corporations are so positioned so that they can kill off 1/3 of the world’s population, create a new world order, and still be fiscally set.
Buy the dip
Wtf wow
>You're obviously not describing a crazy conspiracy theory here, it's just the horrific result of a few people doing literally everything in their power to grow and maintain their wealth using all of the tools that they have available.

This is why hope does not exist. The economy is rigged to the core. If anyone thinks they can beat the system by working hard or gambling in the stock market, they must be a brainwashed optimist. Maybe there would be occasional winners but it is just due to some wealth tricking down.
Those kinds of comments might be a sign that the poster is ""directly over the target"", to use a military metaphor.

I am still reading through OP, but can confirm much of your findings so far.
Dmt
Thomas Piketty?
Can confirm that this is just another superstonk/GME loser trying to pump their stupid narrative. Look at his post history lol.
Forget Capital, there's better out there. Piketty wouldn't be my first choice lol
Either way, what they are saying is true.
Give me another.
It is not.
I like the history books of author Fernand Braudel, they are very easy to read and offer a systemic approach to the 15th-18th century. The first book of the series (out of 3 books) is ""*The Structures of Everyday Life: Civilization and Capitalism*"". The book starts at the micro level and ends at the macro/systemic level.

I'm not sure what is available in English but I liked books from Frédéric Lordon (Good economist + loves philosopher Spinoza and Bourdieu), as well as Cedric Durand (such as : ""Technofeudalism"" ). 

I can't recommend enough to go through Spinoza's ""Ethics"" with Deleuze's guide ""Spinoza: Practical philosophy"", can't get more materialist (and fulfilling) than this imo. Spinoza + Deleuze (on Spinoza) is really good and it will apply to your whole life, everything you accounter etc, really offers fresh new lenses to interpret reality.

And if you are courageous, you can try books from Pierre **Bourdieu,** but maybe begin with translated interviews from him on youtube
And of course, you can read Capital, but don't treat it like some kind of Bible (like the cringe Marxists-Leninists-w/e on reddit), Marx isn't very clear about his labor theory of value, and the Marxists have interpreted it as a Physicalist theory of value (as in, one hit of the hammer of a worker = x units of value). Value is inherently a social concept. 

Otherwise, Marx does go through everything related to the economy, the circulation of money, inflation, stock market, prices, the class struggle of his time and why it happens to be this way (it's a product of history) and more. 

If you were to read it however, I'd recommend this youtube series of David Harvey which is about reading/explaining Capital [https://davidharvey.org/reading-capital/](https://davidharvey.org/reading-capital/)
prove it
I think I read some of Nausea. That was Spinoza right?
I’ll check it out. I consider myself fairly moderate but I took a quiz pertaining to the political compass and I’m all the way to the left and down apparently. I don’t necessarily buy that though. It’s like an online IQ test that isn’t Mensa certified. Everyone’s a genius.
I don't think so? 

As far as I know we have 3 books from him: ""The Ethics"", ""Theological-Political treaty"" and ""On the Improvement of Understanding"" (Traité de la réforme de l'entendement)
Spinoza offers a framework with which you will be able to interpret the world better. Really tackles the most ""self-evident"" concepts that are so ingrained in society and us we don't think about like ""Free will"", Life, Death, Joy, Sadness, Good, Evil, God, Consciousness etc. He 'destroys' transcendency and instead shows that everything and everybody are on the same plane of immanence, and thus things such as essentialisms or religious interpretations of God are non sensical. He shines a light on a lot of general ignorance that we still have **today** (and mind you, it was written in like late 16th century). It's really liberating how he shows that everything is determined chaotically.  
If you read Ethics, try this read order:   
chapter 1 : just bother with the appendix  
chapter 2 : not worth a headache, skim through or skip if it tires you  
chapter 3,4,5 and onwards is where it's at  
Then you can back to 1 and 2. It's really to make it a little less painful.

Bourdieu is perfect for showing how the way people act (me and you included) is an arbitrary product of history, of practices that have been passed generations after generations. That even the way you speak is a product of the socialization process. And the same way that people act the way they do, not because of some abstract ""free will"" or because they rationalize everything before taking a decision, but instead because they were molded this way from the outside, with everyday interactions with the world. The same way, engineers, economists, politicians, rich and poor, etc, are molded, have different ""habitus"" (way of being) that they haven't 'decided' to pick but rather that they have copied from others without even thinking about it, just by being with them, encountering the same situations as them, etc.

Anyways, hope it makes you want to read haha, Braudel doesn't require anything to be read. However, I would recommend reading Spinoza before Bourdieu.
Haha yea political compass tests are like astrology, don't bother with them.
Nausea was Sarte.
Do you believe in organized mind control?
You’re cool.
What do you mean by ""organized mind control""
Promotion of closed circuit logic in subtle ways to invoke self destructive behaviors.
self-destructive behaviors? Like what?

Closed circuit logic? 

What kind of scale are we talking about too, a few people, a city, a society,etc?
It’s like the Nietzschean view of society being inherently insane. Most people identify this co-opted mind control in cults. However, it can really happen just about anywhere. Workplace, in family units, places of education, etc. It’s co-opted by the victor/victim paradigm. It’s become integrated into our social structure and it’s deliberate. Paranoia is a primary output obviously.
Nietzsche is like the edgy Spinoza. Unironically if you read Spinoza before Nietzsche, you'll end up noticing that they both talk about the same things and have the same conclusions but Nietzsche expresses himself in interpretable ways which can lead to weird conclusions (like the Nazis thought with the übermensch stuff and w/e), which is the right-wing/conservative interpretation of Nietzsche (which is wrong by all means and very inadequate).

Nietzsche says society is insane at the time he's writing because, essentially, society has adopted the Christian/Kantian model of philosophy which is a load of idealist bullshit and works on sadness (Spinoza talks a lot about this Sadness). He opposes it to the Greek philosophy which was about ""persévérer dans l'être"" (persevere in being) like Spinoza would say, the affirmation of Being. 

When I say society adopted the Kantian model, it's not like there was a circle of people who took that decision actively. It's more like Kant wrote a philosophy that rationalized the place of the dominants (the dominant class) as being part of the natural order of things (because they used their freewill, because they see art the right way, because etc). And so the dominant class (like early bourgeois, nobility, scholars, church etc) liked this stuff because it talked to them. And since they liked it a lot, they shared it with each other, they put it in academic circles to learn, etc. And Kant wrote this because it's genuinely what his worldview was. And it was his worldview because everything he encountered throughout his life shaped his thought process this way. And all the things he encountered were products of history (heritage of history). And this process goes on and on since the dawn of time.

So no I don't think any of that is deliberate (except in rare circumstances of course). 99% of the time, people act by ""Habitus"", by ""practical reason"" ('Raison pratique' from Bourdieu). They don't actually rationalize what they do before doing things, it's the common *homo-academicus* mistake to think that people rationalize every decision they make. People think the way they do, not because they thought about thinking in a certain way (which is absurd as you can see), but because they inherited it from their environment. 

There are so many things you could still qualify to be 'insane', things as ""Human nature"", ""Freewill"", praising the church, having an idealist worldview etc. But they are insane not because people are dumb, but because they are generators of sadness and ignorance. And they persist because, just like genes but in a social sense, these ways of thinking are transmitted from one generation to the other without even thinking about it.

&#x200B;

Not sure if I was clear enough haha
That’s a very existential standpoint. I’m talking about extensions of MK Ultra rebranded.
then no
I find that difficult to believe with your quite versed anthropological knowledge of the servant/master nexus. The very basis of the state/corporate nexus. The caste dynamics outlined by an oligarchy comprised of the pseudo enlightened. I see it all the time and i even served it. Mods work for free because they have control and get praised by administrators. It doesn’t take much to have a major group to keep a secret when there is power involved.
Why would you need some kind of ""Mk Ultra mind control"" to explain why things are the way they are?
It’s doesn’t explain things. It makes them more confusing and that’s the point.
No. There are explanations that make more sense and are more adequate. History hasn't started since the invention of electronics or mass media. Explaining why things are the way they are with ""A small circle of people have a secret and control everything"" does not make sense historically nor practically. The dominant class has changed a lot throughout history and it never maintained itself because it held some sort of secret or mind control rituals. 

The peasant worked for a Lord in feudal times, not because he rationalized everything happening around him, but because that's how things have been since he was born. That's how he was shaped, by his everyday encounters. The dominant culture is also engrained in everybody including the poorest and most dominant class (and they actually do mistake the dominant culture for ""the natural order""), it's the ""by default opinion"". ""The Lord is the lord because he's the king's chosen, who communicates with God, he speaks much better, and he can read too unlike me"". ""A company CEO is respectable because he merits it, and I wish I could have his place"". ""A priest is a reliable man because he is educated and wise, he can read us the book of god"". I could go on with the examples.

Instead of seeing concording ""ways of being"" (habitus) of people who come from the same medium and have been through the same schools, experienced relatively the same things, have the same cultural capital, etc, and thus have the same view of the world and think the same way how to solve problems;  
It seems to me that you are mistaking *signs* for an actual goal/path set by whatever close circle of people.

Every belief we hold today can be historicized and traced back. The authors can be historicized the same way. Ritual practices can be traced back in history, processions can be explained, and why the Media works the way it does can be explained. Everything is inherited and modified very slowly through history. Just like genetics but at a social level. Sometimes there are 'revolutions' of the social order, like when Neoliberalism took over the economics field. When in the Renaissance, Aristotle was rediscovered and overthrew the Plato paradigm. 

And thus, even nowadays rituals can be historicized and explained. The dominant class is 99% of the time not even aware of what the dominant culture is. They do literally take it for granted like Fish take water for granted.
And they take it for granted because it's their **taste** (Their habitus, inherited through countless social interactions). You don't question why you like this painting instead of that painting. Why you prefer salt over pepper. Why you speak in the highs instead of the lows. Etc etc. The same way goes for why they see the dominant culture as natural.
I question my likes all the time. That’s kind of the root of dialectic thought. It is said that Plato was Aristotle. Also, I know for a fact that monarch mind control exists because I’ve experienced it first hand.
""Also, I know for a fact that monarch mind control exists because I’ve experienced it first hand.""

Can you elaborate?
I cannot.
I don’t engage anymore.
what
I just don’t pay attention to things that are meant to deter me from being a productive human being anymore.
Are you okay?
Do you mean that: I'm meant to deter you from being a productive human being?
I’m busy working and building a relationship the best I can with my son. He’s everything to me. So usually I don’t pay much attention to intentional distractions. The point I’m trying to make is that there is a lot of misinformation in this world. I can tell you based on my personal experience and my family’s experience, coordinated messaging, drugging, gaslighting, does happen. People didn’t take it seriously until recently. There’s an underbelly in society and it’s not just conventional criminals my friend. They come in many forms and professions. This post, for example, is talking about the rehypothecated time bomb our economy is. How it’s basically a fiscal house of cards. Men making billions with our tax payer money, like Blackrock. Private Equity is now the 4th branch of the government. It sounds like a lot of nonsense. Trust me I don’t believe it myself most of the time. What I will tell you is that I have been drugged multiple times, stalked, and told that recent events did not take place. Recent as in like within minutes recent. It’s a joke. Most of these people are higher earning professionals as that happens to be the crown I’ve found myself in lately. None of it is good. Be grateful that you don’t fully understand the way society operates because it does so on Mimetic theory and Keynesian Economics. That’s the basic blueprint. Plus tabloid level PR. I followed you because you seem like a good person from what I gather. If you ever want to you can check out my subreddit. It’s r/libertyandreason Have a good night. Keep reading!

No. I wasn’t implying that."
Capitalist propaganda has taught millions of Americans to hate the poor and to hate themselves when they are poor. We must heal our national psyche and recognize we all rise and fall TOGETHER,155,https://i.redd.it/8xslomqelt971.jpg,"You do not have the right to the labor of other people.
That’s commie talk.
You’re entitled only to what you can make with your own two hands. Everything else costs extra, but on the other side of the same coin, if anyone else wants what you’ve made with your own two hands, they have to pay you for it. “He who dies not work does not eat.”
It really is sad. But whenever I'm talking to someone and they are talking in a way that furthers divisiveness I call them out. Poor people aren't the problem.

Everyone, except for literally the 1% is closer to being poor and on the street than a billionaire.  No sense in hating your neighbor just because they have fallen on hard times. Could be you next week. A little class solidarity goes a long way.
Capitalism is the most pro-choice system on earth.
Ok but with what will you replace it?
If you believe ""You just have to work hard and you'll be successful."", then you'd have to believe the flip side that ""If you're not successful that means you're lazy."". Look at all these edgelord comments, proving the tweet right how capitalism have turned them to shitty assholes. Hey if you're rich, you've discounted how much luck has played into your life, and one bad flip of a metaphorical coin a while ago, you could be that homeless person pushing that cart...
Religious gaslighting. The OG.
Unfortunately, platitudes do not change minds, mostly stupid poor people vote with their wallets which is why we are here in the first place. 

While not kowtowing to corporations you have to show people how it is in the best interest (I.e., play to their wallets) but with alternatives that do not serve the corporate overlords.  Look at Electric Vehicles and Solar/renewable.  These two industries have ballooned in public popularity which is why “Big Oil (and Gas)” and Major car manufacturers have now finally begun to retool and seek to appease the public with products/markets they NEVER wanted to engage in before the populous forced their hand by just gradually buying the better alternative. 

Evil people will always serve their own interests, first. You have to show them that they can still profit from “good”

Same and similar is slowly beginning to happen with plastics as well. Yes, you need governments to also push for the right things , too… you have to use a “full court press”
Capitalism has taught me nothing of the sort. This is socialist propaganda to create a welfare state off the back of the working class taxes. We don’t rise and fall together, many work much harder than you and many work less harder than you. It’s only your fault you are where you are, any other excuse is a lie.
Hmmm. If it walks like a duck, sounds like a duck, looks like a duck,, it must be good old fashioned Communism... no, I'll keep my honor, my self worth. Learn a trade.

If you think america has implemented capitalism you are mistaken. We have crony capitalism with a marxist central bank. We are at most a 25 percent capitalist economy
This might be an unpopular opinion as it's slightly unrelated. It says EVERYONE, deserves shelter, and food and clean water... I don't think a good part of the inmate population deserves it. Murders and pedophiles, people that ruined other's lives, yet... They get 3 meals a day, ac, a gym... Now that doesn't sit right with me
Capitalism is amazing. Our country’s perverted version of capitalism due to government over reach in our schools, trade, and work is what has destroyed a good thing
Comments on how calling libertarianism dumb is dumb then blocks me so I can't reply. About as expected from someone suffering from libertarian brain rot.
....How can the so-called “GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD” with the best this and the best that, NOT have clean drinking water for the most PATRIOTIC civilians the world has ever seen? 


Water????



Not even clean drinking water???



But how??????

I left America and they have press conferences on how to make the water BETTER where I am, and there are certain AMERICAN foods that are banned here to protect the PEOPLE. 

The people HERE are ungrateful as fuck, they STILL complain and their government is waaaaaaay nicer to them than the American government is to American people. The people HERE can’t wait to leave because like most people, they believe all Americans are millionaires...well, White Americans. They actually WANT Burger King, McDonalds and all the other crap but it was not allowed. 

Doctors even make house visits here and it’s MANDATORY for first time visits. When I moved here, I was SHOCKED.
If I cared about giving “the poors” water I would have never purchased Water Works.
Just try buying a piece of land and building a house yourself like a lot of our great great grandparents did.  It’s simply illegal to build shelter for most people now days.
If I start something and they voluntarily work for me in a free market economy where they can quit as they please, those are the breaks
Correct, all workplaces should be cooperatives, where you are able to work without someone else being entitled to your labour.
Correct - only the federal reserve has that right
Yes I do.

Ok so that would mean that I was entitled to keep.the entirety of the surplus value of my labor right? If that's not the case then apparently my employer was entitled to my labor and it's value.

We are all entitled to the value of each others' labor.  Full stop.
Great Quote from the same group of immigrants who thought witch burnings produced progress. William Bradford. Excellent role model. Except he didn't work much at all and his band were genocidal ungrateful maniacs with a relationship to sex and power that would make a capitalist cringe. As you'd find the most toxic form of socialism was practiced. Centralized redistribution.
No it's not.  It's pro-capital.  You just want everyone to believe starving is a valid choice, and coercion isn't real.
My mother is recovering from breast cancer and cannot return to work due to fluid around her heart. That’s not her fault. She needs government assistance, literally she paid taxes into the system so she’s entitled to it.
This. Nobody has a right to another’s labor. Making something free just means people with jobs are paying for it. Even if they’re not literally paying for it (taxes) and the government made the money out of thin air we still pay with inflation.
There is no free market economy in the world though. Only manipulated markets exist. Almost always manipulated by corporate money from the richest and greediest. Free markets are a pipe dream as long as we allow shit like “Citizen’s United” to stand. There are plenty of studies showing that a vote in the US is meaningless without substantial capital backing.
No one is entitled to your labor. They trade for it. 

Boss: I have a job which pays X
Worker: OK
Yes!  That's why me and 2,000 of my closest friends pooled our money and built a state of the art automotive manufacturing plant. If you think I'm being too sarcastic in this response then deep down you agree with me on how ridiculous your statement was. This is not the middle ages.  Capital is needed to start a business and starting a business is risky. If they are accepting the risk they deserve the rewards. Employers are not ""entitled"" to your labor. They pay you a negotiated rate for it.
They do not.
Pro slavery. Interesting stance to take. Suspected troll.
No one has the right to other peoples labor? 
You have to convince them to give it or its work product to you voluntarily? Now how would you do that ?
No. The LTV is shit. 

The value of your labor is JUST your labor. The work product is 100% separate.
Actually the romans were slavers. So they thought they had the right to the labor of other people. 

And, yes, they also had rampant infanticide. 

It seems these are the hallmarks of failing civilizations.
Military has a ton of private contractors. Idk what the hell you call our economy since it has capitalism and socialism at work
If that’s the case, then I’ll do nothing, you do all the work, and I’m entitled to the products of your labor.
I work hard and eat very well.
I hope she gets better. But your comment doesn’t make sense as a reply to mine. No where did I mentioned healthcare, even the original post didn’t mention healthcare or even medical conditions. I never mentioned abolishing Medicare or Medicaid or access to medical care . Simply put, distributing wealth to people who don’t participate isn’t feasible, never has been.  You are where you are based on your decision. As you said, your mom deserves treatment based on taxes “she’s” paid. That means she made the right decisions .I hope your reading comprehension improves so you can understand words and meaning better next time. ✌️
its called crony capitalisms....

the idea that a free market exists following the simple laws of supply and damned are foolish, naïve or simply lying. I dont think there was ever a moment in history where a free market existed, governments and power have always manipulated it
So the governing body is hopelessly corrupt, so we should give that entity more power?
Boss: Your labour generates X value, and I will pay you X/50.  
Worker: I don't like that deal  
Boss: Tough, every job is like that.

&#x200B;

You need land in order to have somewhere to live, but all of the land was already owned by the time you were born. So for whatever you want to do in life, the current owners are entitled to your labour for having inherited this land.

Privately owned businesses have enough first mover advantage, enough legislative capture, and enough economy of scale, to make starting a business require an amount of capital effectively impossible for many to acquire - and even if they could, they would still be forced to give someone else the fruits of their labour in order to build this up, no consent required.

It's not consent if alternative options are purposefully made to be deadly or impossible.
Yes they are.
They create 35% of the money supply in two years out of thin air, give it away and it’s used to purchase the same goods and services. I think they found a loophole in your labor.
Its not about labor its about most efficient labor. We spend or spent too much time doing things that don’t sustain us. Leaving us with either relying on the government, starting your own business, or wage labor. These 3 choices are not the most efficient choices for us as a whole.
[deleted]
That is some painfully dumb bullshit as if labor and it's products are not a shared value. Try again.
Wrong.  We are entitled to the benefits of your labor.
A mixed economy?

TBH there is veeery little public ownership, and much fewer people working cooperatives, in the US compared to its equivalents elsewhere. It's about as close as you can get to a fully capitalist country while still having what can be reasonably recognised as a government.
Yes, you are entitled to my labor, and I'm letting you suckle at my teat of prosperity.  I know you are a hard working, industrious, and motivated person, so I don't mind giving you my support.  Also, I know that you are going to keep working because your nature is to produce.  You will by your nature continue to produce.  Should you fail to continue working, I'm fine with you having your basic needs met, and you taking naps all day.
Your edge case is not representative of the majority who work hard.
Lol I mean dude she’s been low income all her life, in reality it’s taxes from the middle and upper class that are paying her way now and will continue to do so for the next 20+ years.

And I think that’s right. There’s always going to be people fortunate enough to be born intelligent, in a well off family, etc. 

My main comment was in reply to your last sentence though. I mean it’s a direct reply to that? It’s not my mother’s choice/fault to have gotten cancer and then having to rely on socialist services due to her disability.
Who said that? No, we should create free markets, free from manipulation. We should reform the governing body, specifically through campaign finance reform so that our voting powers are restored and our republic and its fate isn’t owned solely by monied interests.
When you agree to press a button for X dollars, you are entitled to X dollars. X dollars if the button turns out a rubber duck, X dollars if the button makes a sports car. 

You are selling your labor. Period. Not buying into the entire value of the production chain. 

On the land, there is more than enough land owned by the federal government that you could get lost in it and live like a savage if you wanted to. You just don’t want to. Because it is a terrible life. 

If you don’t consent to labor for your own life, then shuffle off this mortal coil and take your over inflated sense of entitlement with you.
Not every job is like that, there are lots of worker-owned cooperatives. There are even plenty of literal communes in the US that you are free to join at any time and work entirely for shared resources.
They did not. They flat out stole 33% of the total value of our economy and got people to cheer them on by flicking a few singles at them.

They did it. They did not have the right.
Nothing in all the world gets to live with no labor. It takes labor to maintain life. That is an immutable truth humans are not immune to.
Economics 101 time for you. All goods and services are priced at the equilibrium point between supply and demand. 

The value of a button pusher is the same if the button makes a rubber duck or a high end sports car.
That’s fine and dandy. I’m not willing to do the same for you. You can call me names if you like, but the fact of the matter is, in order to enforce your ideas of how the world should be run on other people, you have to resort to totalitarianism and the use of violent force as a coercive threat to get those who don’t agree to fall in line. That’s evil and I won’t abide by it.
If you can show me an example of a system that has done more good for more people than capitalism I might put some stock in your claim.
Without capitalism and free market revenue those “taxes” wouldn’t be available. Most of those programs like social security are Ponzi schemes.
Of course I consent to labour. I just do not consent to a capitalist being entitled to the proceeds of that labour due to a government regulatory and enforcement framework saying that they do.

This is why I support cooperatives, that I may freely trade my labour without anyone who does not contribute to the labour being entitled to it.
None of them without be successful in the absence of a capitalism backdrop.
They did have that right. The government gave it to them. You give your consent by voting for anyone who isnt pledging to get rid of them.
All of us are entitled to the value produced by your labor.
[deleted]
Untrue.  We are entitled to the benefits of your labor.
False, this theory of yours presupposes an entirely free market with no externalities positive or negative. Which has never existed and thus is only a thought exercise. Of course it also would only apply to inelastic goods and services.
Oh wow I just noticed you're a libertarian and a fan of Milton Friedman that explains the extremely dumb takes.
There’s a big reason why there’s a whole shitton of classes after Econ 101
Why would I need to use violent force to get you to lay on your couch and play video games all day, while receiving a UBI check from the government each month?  You said yourself that you wouldn't voluntarily do any work under such a horrible system.

>If that’s the case, then I’ll do nothing, you do all the work, and I’m entitled to the products of your labor.

Imagine- your healthcare free to you, your energy, housing, and food needs met, and access to donated clothing or vouchers for shops.  If you decide to go back to work, you still need not worry for your most basic needs.  You can apply for work where you might be interested, or even return to university or trade school if you want to learn more about a particular field.  Why would I need to put a gun to your head?  Where would I need to point the gun to achieve any of this?

Edit:  It's of import to note that the commenters who claim to be hard workers and find socialistic policies most distasteful are the first to proclaim they will stop working altogether, should they be faced with a society where some get the benefit of ""not working"".
If you can show me one system that has done more damage to human health and the natural environment than capitalism, I might put some stock in your reply. Laborers were forced to engage in literal gun battles with employers and their hired killers to support labor strikes fighting for better wages and working conditions. Mine owners, steel magnates, and railroad barons all used local and state police, private detectives, and mobsters to maim and murder, beat, and intimidate labor organizers and workers and their families in attempting to break their will to strike.  Sounds like the workers uplifted themselves to me, and the capitalists want the credit.
Um ok?
So if you don’t want to trade your labor, start you own business or wonder off into the woods. 

You are not entitled to the labor of other people
Ew go home
So. I didn’t consent. Good. 

And what do we call it when good are taken by force or threat of force from people who do not consent?
Yes. 

Now, you have a choice. You can

A: become a subsistence farmer who makes all his own tools.

Or

B: participate in a complex economy allowing you to master a single highly valued skill which you trade with others for the product of their labor. Ultimately this allows you to labor less and have a substantially higher quality of life. 

I mean, the choice seems simple to me.
That theory of mine isn’t mine, it is economics… so…

It doesn’t require a perfectly free market to be true. Influences on the market can distort wages by influencing the supply or the demand, but the underlying truth remains. 

The alternative, the labor theory of value, is such absolute shit it has never survived any real world test. The value of labor is in only a tiny fraction controlled by worker productivity. Even then, it is in the opposite direction predicted by Marx.
Oh wow I just noticed you’re an ill educated and entitled idiot. That explains the shit takes…

No. No, seriously. I noticed that right off the mark, I just was trying to be polite.
for someone to call a libertarian dumb, really must be truly beyond the point of the stupid that they can’t even grasp how stupid they are. Libertarian views is what this country was founded on free from government over reach. The fed is who destroys our economy
Capitalism is amazing. Our country’s perverted version of capitalism due to government over reach in our schools, trade, and work is what has destroyed a good thing
You miss the point. I work for a living. You’d be pointing the gun at my head to get the money for other people’s UBI. If you’re going to point a gun at my head to get money for other people’s UBI, I’ll stop working. I’ll stop producing. That’s the only smart move. And when you give everyone in the nation the choice between having their hard earned savings stolen at gunpoint or sitting on the couch playing video games, EVERYONE will choose the latter. With no one working, no one producing, everyone stretching their hands out for free stuff, where are you going to get that UBI from? That money doesn’t come from nowhere, and there are extremely few people willing to break their backs for no benefit to themselves and only for the benefit of perfect strangers. You severely underestimate the amount of work necessary to keep people alive, and you severely overestimate the amount of people willing to enslave themselves to others. And even if there were enough people, building a system that only functions because it exploits people that way is no better than a system built on the backs of slaves. It’s immoral.
I didn’t think you could.
Very intellectual
I have addressed both of those points already in my previous comments.
Yes I am.
It’s wander, not wonder. Your inability for nuance explains a lot about your previous comments. You get the broad strokes, but the nuance flies right over your head, totally changing the outcome of any real logic that might’ve been happening inside there.
We call that theft. Larceny.
Imagine supposing an economic theory as though it's an objective theory of hard science.
You just stated that you only think two theories of value exist but please go on about how I am uneducated.
The world is entitled to the value of your labor.  Get with it.
Thanks!  You just described capitalism, in a nutshell.  Labor strikes- people ""refusing to work"" have been the only things that have brought about significant labor reform under capitalism.  The coercion of starvation and homelessness in a society of surplus is the ""gun to your head"", not some form of Universal Basic Income.  You've got it backward, mate.  The billionaire oligarchs do not earn their money, or work hard for it.  You do.  You support them sitting on their couch, eating bon-bons, and playing video games, and tweeting about tax evasion.  Their lawyers, who also live on your labor output, then run their corporations, assisting in the evasion of taxes for your schools, roads, and other infrastructure that benefits the majority of people, just not the billionaires.  How do you think they have time to take their yachts to Davos, where they can share the latest anti-labor policies and model tax shelter legislation with each other?  You work, they plot, and play on your dime.  You make them possible.  Now that you know that, are you still down for work stoppage, knowing that some bums are using your labor for not only their leisure, but to plot against your financial, and medical security?  Why are you all for supporting their exploitation of you, but not your fellow worker's dependence on your labor?  Who do you have more in common with?
Capitalism didn't uplift anyone.  Collective bargaining and socialist ideals did.  All workers benefit comes in spite of capitalism, not because of its implementation.
I mean what else is there to say you’re minds made up
Yeah. You think you are owed more than the value if your labor, i suspect you think you can live off others with no labor at all, either way you are wrong.
Hur dur, you used an O instead of an A so I know all about you.
Yeah he smashed you, sorry
Al Capone couldn’t get away with tax evasion. You think the government is going to let their biggest cash cows get away without paying their cut? Millionaires and billionaires pay more in taxes proportionally than anyone else. And “fellow workers” aren’t fellow workers if they don’t work. So why would I support them? How is that any different that your incorrect view of billionaires living on the work of the middle class?

It’s incorrect because all of their money is acquired through willing trades, none of it is stolen. Millions of people want iPhones, so the people making iPhones sell millions and make millions of dollars.

You’re trying to get me on your side by essentially bribing me with promises of what’ll make life better for me personally. Yeah well, life would be better for me personally if I were to enslave other people to get what I want. You’re trying to get me to go along with you in justifying evil acts by trying to get me to hate a particular group of people for no other reason than because they’re more successful than you. You say “shut up and take the money” I say “where did you get it from?”

UBI isn’t going to come from millionaires and billionaires. They have the money to leave the nation and remove themselves from your influence. It’s going to come out of the pockets of people like me.

No, hard workers don’t stop working when there are some who get the benefits of not working, I’m going to stop working when I don’t get the benefits of having worked. When I go to work for 48 hours a week, I do so with the expectation that I’m going to get paid for it. I wouldn’t do it otherwise. If I’m not going to get paid because that money is going towards other people’s UBI, then why am I doing all this work? There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Your plan operates on the assumption that the entire economy will continue to run exactly the same as it does now after you remove all the incentive structures to do any work, and that’s doomed to fail. You might think you’ve mathematically figured out the most optimal way to do things, but you’ve forgotten that humans are not rational beings. We are instinctively territorial and we want to know that doing work will increase our chances of survival by increasing our access to resources. If you think you can convince everyone to act against that instinct, you’re delusional.

You’re conniving, deceitful, and you don’t care about anyone but yourself. You try to justify things you know are wrong by targeting people you personally don’t like. You try to loop other people into your scheme by telling them it’s in their best interest to hurt others.

I’m not going to join you. That’s final.
What do all first world countries have in common?   Capitalism.  I rest my case.
Not “my” doing, it’s literally how free market funds social programs. Otherwise, where does money come from?
I have never, in any of my comments, intimated that I think I should live off the labour of others, or that I 'deserve' more than the value of my labour.

I am, for the third time, in favour of *cooperatives*, where I can freely trade my labour without having to give part of it to a capitalist who has not earned it.
No he's not.  He's entitled to your labor.
Words have actual meanings. Wonder =/= wander. Typos are one thing. Misunderstanding of the language is another. Type in your native language and we’ll use a translator. I would likely make those type of errors in a foreign language too.

You keep telling yourself that while you yoke some people up for yourself.
You are an idiot.
Can’t remember what they say next?! Lmfao
Mutualism as in anarcho-socialism? Sounds great, sign me up. 

Not sure what the relevance of Venezuela is though
Good draught horses make the best glue.  Stay yoked, mate.
Also, I have you yoked already.  A bit of every dollar you earn will pay my social security and medicare!  I don't just draw from a pool of money I contributed.  I get some of yours as well.  Thanks in advance for making my retirement of leisure and promoting socialism daily possible.  Could have done it without you, but I'm very glad you felt like contributing!  Cheers!
Man AI will be taking over a ton of jobs in the future. 

In other words our labor will be replaced literally with robots.

It’s not far fetched to think there won’t be enough jobs for everyone. 

UBI will be the only answer.
No, I'm irrefutable.
Venezuela was mutualism on a national scale. It went as poorly as anyone with a half a working brain cell thought it would.
Then you should be able to provide and answer with examples of other systems that have provided a better quality of life than capitalism, but you won’t.  Because you can’t.
Still not sure what the relevance is to a claim that a  cooperative is a superior type of workplace to a private one. We have cooperatives here in the UK, no need to travel to a mismanaged petrostate
Socialism provided the quality of life, capitalism provided the impetus to revolt. Socialism wins, hands down.
Because co-ops are acceptable when sprinkled around in a capitalist economy. They don’t last long, but they pop up from time to time, but they are a terrible way to manage an economy as a whole. 

Venezuela thought that if they made every business a worker owner co-op everyone would work together and rainbows would sprout from every surface. What they found was that economics is the study of how the world actually is, and ignoring it and pretending extra hard its rules don’t apply doesn’t change the fact that they do. Productivity fell, hours went up, and the co-ops became competitive between each other. The strong exploited the weak and the whole system collapsed.
Yeah dude.  Kinda like North Korea?  It’s worked out for their citizens hasn’t it?
You know what happens to Co-ops here? They’re outlandishly profitable. They make so much money that they get bought out by global capitalists. [https://workersparadise.org/2019/12/30/new-belgium-brewery-goes-flat/](https://workersparadise.org/2019/12/30/new-belgium-brewery-goes-flat/)

The YOOGE difference is, when they sold this co-op to a global capitalist every owner/worker got rich, not just a a CEO and the Board. Incentives lead to innovation, and isn’t that the heart of capitalism? Or wasn’t it supposed to be? Before the heart of capitalism became profit over social benefit?
How do the citizens of North Korea own or take part in the economy?  How is North Korea considered socialism?  It isn't.  It isn't democratic, it isn't a republic.  It's an authoritarian military dictatorship with mock elections.  Last I checked, that isn't socialism.  Capitalists love to point at things that claim to be communism or socialism, yet are not in any way socialist, and say ""look at the results of socialism!"" Pathetic straw men arguments won't fly here.  You know that isn't socialism, and so does everyone else.  Keep lying.
Hur dur you said yooge you must be a dumb.
Ok if socialism is so great what countries are socialist and how has it helped them?
Such a profound response…
Socialism has helped every country that exists on the planet. Every capitalist country has a labor movement founded on socialist principles that works to undermine the capitalist totalitarian dogma that is expounded by wealthy oligarchs. The same dogma you espouse here. There is a list of socialist countries [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_socialist_states). Perhaps you will read about them and learn something. Even Mao, who I find despicable was able to lift more people out of poverty than currently live in the United States. Capitalism doesn’t exist to lift people up. It exists to maintain itself.  Only socialism within capitalist nations has improved lives."

Not sure what country you live in but, in the USA, we just elected Joe Biden for President and he is going to fix our economy.  He even put ex Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen on the job so it's a sure thing.  Just walk across the southern border and you'll be well taken care of...no more worries.
Yes
Wealth inequality tends to have an exponential blowout historically. We are just barely hitting the beginning of the curve. 

Economic rents will converge to consume all income above the subsistence level for at least 90% of the population. 

check back in in 8 years and see what the situation is.
The US has adopted a european style, specifically anglo-saxon feudal economy since about the 70's. This has given birth to a new rentier class composed entirely of people who aren't even generational Americans. 

The visitors have setup tents inside the ruins of America.

The consequence is a collapsing birth rate and general stagnation. With the 'green new deal' stimulus this will accelerate into lack of energy infrastructure to maintain a high output industrial civilization.

High costs of living with more and more people dependant on modern oligarchs for their wellbeing is what you can expect if this continues on.

For example largh swaths of homes were turned into landlord-rentier by wallstreet after the 08 crash under Obama. Coupled with the silicon valley-new internet hollywood brainwashing piped into everyones home and you get the situation we are currently stuck in.
Can rents go up a lot more? If wages (/govt subsidies) follow, sure. But if wages don’t follow, you can’t charge someone more for rent than they can physically pay. Housing is already in a bubble. In nominal terms, it can technically grow forever, but in real terms, I don’t see housing or rents getting much higher.

Inflation can outpace growth infinitely. Every fiat currency in history has hyper-inflated to the value of 0 with exception of a large handful of currencies the last 50 years.

Maybe rent will be $2,000 a month. Maybe min wage will be 30/hr and med wages will be 100k. But rent can’t go up forever without wages also increasing.

A collapse is not inevitable but a crash is. The world is over-indebted. 2008 was a major private debt crisis. The first one since 1929. In 1929, people, companies, and banks defaulted on their debts bc deflation forced them to. This time, govt stopped a lot of that by printing. Due to that, debts weren’t defaulted as much and the world is still over-indebted and HAVE to pay off/default on their debts. For the last 12 years, The Fed Reserve/ govt has been fighting this deflationary depression. Their goal seems to be to try to slowly inflate the debt by creating moderate inflation. However, as this happens, corporations just add more debt bc it’s more attractive as rates go more negative. So debt isn’t deleveraged, it’s added which is the opposite of what NEEDS to happen. My point is that debt in the private sector is too high so it MUST get worse before it gets better since private sector debt/GDP must be lowered which is painful. If the govt left everything alone, we would have a massive deflationary crash (followed by a boom as the bad debts would be cleared from the economy). So a collapse is not inevitable. The govt may lose the battle to deflation.

Also, the top 10% were hurt the most in terms of wealth % during the Great Depression. Stocks went down in value while cash went up. Rich hold stocks, poor/middle class hold cash. Of course, this may time be different (and I think it will). Inflation may win, and in a scenario where huge inflation wins, the top 10% don’t win. The top .0001% with political insiders are the only ones able to see ahead and shift wealth to certain places ahead of time or have the poltical insiders shift wealth/ new currency to them during/after the collapse. Venezuela’s stock market went down 99%+ in real terms. The top 10% did not win. The few in political power didn’t do as bad.

Keep in mind, inflation is a tax. The govt controls the supply of money. So inflation will continue for as long as the govt continues to tax this way, or, of course it could continue regardless of govt if people lose faith.
One of the things that we all need to consider is the impact of Zero Interest Rate Policy. Much of the inflation around the housing market has to do with historically low interest rates, pushing the prices up.

Another thing that probably needs to be considered: the effects you are describing, at least in the housing market, don't apply the same way across generations. People who bought a house in, say, the 80s or 90s have seen their assets appreciate significantly. Those of us that have entered the housing market in the 2000s have been faced with a different story.

This isn't to say that the system isn't broken. But it is interesting to see specific aspects at play.
No they won't. The next thing in the upcoming weeks and months will be a deflationary depression.
Interest rates go up, economy slows down. High cash liquidity owners get a sale of assets. 

That would have been a traditional way. With MMT its weirder.
Yes.  I recently traveled to south America and that's how a lot of people live.  Even middle class single men can't afford an apartment unless they rent it as a group.  The food they eat is very heavy on beans,  rice,  and locally grown vegetables and fruits because that's what they can afford.  Privately owned cars are very rare and many families chip in to get a motorcycle for family use.  It's like a modern day dark ages where society is separated by class.  The very rich,  and the very poor.  It's headed that way in the USA now.  Young people,  even the ones that work can't afford housing or healthcare. Tennessee listed 257,000 jobs on their website.  Only 8500 of them paid more than 20,000 dollars a year!
No, because eventually voting works.
No. They will go down. We are in an inflationary bubble. I'm older & have been through it 3 times in my life. Inflation is awful. If you have saved anything don't be scared to buy when things burst but realize deflation can last a long time & it will also feel like you are trapped in quicksand. Be a contrarian.  Buy when it seems hopeless, hang on & sell when things are high, when everyone else wants to buy.
The government wants the general population poor as it generally gives them more control (welfare). A good chunk of the rich would hurt if the general populace can't afford basic necessities such as rent and utilities
Rich people approve of this, so... yes.
Wait until the Fed published the fomc minutes because it's at that point when prices will go to the moon as the dollar hits zero either this evening or before you even wake up tomorrow morning. That being said, it won't matter at that point because price rises will be the least of your or anyone else's concerns as a worthless dollar will bring about Venus Syndrome and kill every living thing on the planet within two or three days

Inflation has been here for a decade, it’s escalating now. Protect yourselves at r/wallstreetsilver
Yet everywhere I look companies are saying employees aren’t coming to work which is causing shortages and delays which makes prices go up. Government paying them too much to stay home. Everyone else is working their butt off. Current Government stated clearly they wanted/needed inflation as it was a good thing. Blame the people that voted based not on what’s great for the country but based on how government divides everyone into groups in order to get votes. 🤔 The overkill in the media/entertainment is so obvious and needs to stop.

I am embarrassed to say I voted for Joe, but some of his policies- like the vaccine mandate- are taking away hope & jobs from people. The fact that the government is trying to push medical mandates on people is something we only saw in Nazi Germany- not is the US. People are living in fear that they will lose their job, get sick, lose their insurance, and not be able to feed their family. Anyone speaking out about this is being censored on social media & on Google- again- another thing we haven’t seen in the US before . Wake up & don’t believe the mainstream media.

>Economic rents will converge to consume all income above the subsistence level for at least 90% of the population.

I concur.  It is going on slowly right now as we speak. We pay 'rent' on everything.  Streaming services are 'rent' in a recreational sense; but many may, or may not realize that small businesses also have to 'rent' business software services.  All the -monopolies-  have you paying a subscription fee for everything.  This is killing smaller businesses everywhere. Economic rent.  Wages are a part of the overhead and therefore can somewhat be controlled.

>The govt may lose the battle to deflation.

We have a K shaped recovery or should I say a K shaped economy. On one side we have the real economy that is in the toilet and on the other the financials that is blooming. Yeah right, the rich will get to enjoy prices going down because they are getting ever wealthier.    
  
The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and that basket is different for each person. You can have high inflation rates in food and deflation in other stuff. A true inflation means a decrease in purchasing power in everything for everyone rich and poor. But we don't see that happening.   
  
For example, the CPI basket might be deflationary for a rich person who spends most of his money on luxury products. For a poor person with food making up most of the spending it would be inflationary. There is just no way to effectively measure changes in prices from using a basket of goods when all it calculates is the average.
> Can rents go up a lot more? 

Of course they can go up.  You can always just add roommates.  

There are three young women who rent a nice sized house across the street from me.  The one young lady told me she wished she could have a place of her own without the roommates. I casually asked what the rent was, and she replied $2400 a month.  But they split it three ways so....
When Tennessee listed the jobs, was that supposed to be a list of all the jobs in Tennessee, or just the ones that were up for grabs? I imagine that the job of “corporate lawyer”, or whatever would not be on that list, so I’m hoping that Tennessee has a lot of well paying jobs, they are just not listed on a job board.
Have you tried finding a job outside a city that is equivalent to the cost of living relative? Have you done a cross analysis of cost of living to income ratios on the county Level. Presently only Oklahoma, South Dakota and Nebraska are leverageable in that way. Also northern Minnesota. Even so even if you lower your ambitions you are looking at 4-6 roommates with no children. That being said that is the rate of pay for the jobs on offer. And you would be financially stable at that point. Avg rate of pay would need to double or rents and medicine half for things to look sustainable outside of these micro regions.
Good bot
Where do you live? I’m in Texas and things are booming here. Stores and restaurants can’t find people to put to work. We went out to eat Friday evening and were told we would have to wait 20 minutes for a table because they were so short staffed. When we finished our meal, we noticed the restaurant was full of patrons.
No judgement here. I felt bamboozled by the person I voted for 20 years ago (Bush) and haven't voted since.  The 2 party system is broken.  I respect your honesty.

I think it’s less of the mandates as medical mandates have been around(babies required shots, shots for kids before they start school) it’s the fact of the vaccines are believed by over half the country to be as effective or safe as we what once thought.  That could be largely due to politics or covid fatigue.  Time will tell.

You should check out the first episode of Pitchfork Economics.

https://pitchforkeconomics.com/episode/why-do-we-call-it-pitchfork-economics/

It has Walter Scheidel as a guest who is a historian at Stanford. The most frequently cited active-duty Roman historian adjusted for age in the Western Hemisphere, Scheidel is the author or (co-)editor of 20 books, including The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality.

But he ultimately argues that the only equalizing events in history come at great calamity. Calls them the 4 or 5 horsemen or something. It's all quite depressing that we know what's going to happen but lack the will and selflessness to change our course.
Its too late for that
Yep, the US adopted anglosaxon economics in the 1970's which are entirely based on rents and usury.  


The world is heading into a major multi-generational stagnation period where technology is used to exploit instead of uplift.
We can call inflation an increase in the purchasing power of a dollar if you want but I think it’s a weird way to define it as an increase in one’s purchasing power with regards to someone’s financial assets. That makes it nearly impossible to calculate and highly variant. It also ignores the fact that there’s inflation in financial assets and the fact that financial assets are more expensive to buy.

Inflation from luxury products has been pretty high the last decade when compared to other things. When rich people have more money, they bid up prices on things such as luxury products and financial assets. So it’s actually the opposite. There’s been more inflation on things the rich spend money on (such as financial assets) than the poor due to them making a % increase in wages and bidding up prices. But yeah, I agree, it’s impossible for CPI to 100% accurately measure inflation for every person since everyone has different spending habits. And especially considering govt calculates it.

And like you said, the only thing doing well is financials. What happens if people think the CFs they’ll get from those assets will be atrocious? Cyclical P/E ratio is already higher than 1929. Stocks aren’t just something that people can bid up higher forever regardless of price. They’re real companies with real CFs. At a certain point, it makes more sense to invest that money into a different asset that can yield higher CFs or retain purchasing power.
Exactly. That means she limits what she pays. She can only afford $800. She can’t afford her own place. This means her demand for her amount of housing is lower than it may be at a “normal time” of housing/rent prices bc she is demanding “less of a product”. Lower demand over times results in lower prices.

People can only pay what they can afford. And if everyone starts rooming together to save money, that means less landlords will be able to find renters since the renters are sharing houses. In this case, there would be an excess of houses per se. Some landlords could lower the price to attract renters, miss payments and foreclose/go bankrupt, sell the house at a lower price than they might have thought they could’ve gotten, etc etc etc. But like I said, it can continue to noticeably go up if demand for housing (aka wages/subsidies) increases in accordance

Edit: misread what you said a little, changed wording
Tennessee does have some high paying jobs like most other places.  However the listing was supposed to be available jobs.  It's still a pretty bad problem.  The local subway restaurant pays their employees 8 dollars per hour and one free meal per shift.  I'm a nurse currently and I get 20$ an hour which is now under paid thanks to the recent inflation.  I know a few RNs with years of experience that make around 35 to 40 an hour.   Cheap apartments around here are about 900 to 1100 a month.  Car insurance, car payments, fuel, food, taxes,  maintenance for the car and medical insurance are just more than most jobs will pay for. Most jobs in my region pay less than 18$ per hour and the benefits vary. Record profits are unpaid wages in many cases.

I’m in Arizona. Same situation here. I can tell you having worked retail during the first seven months last year at a corporate job, I was treated terribly. I’d have men waiting outside for me after my shift was over and law enforcement isn’t any good because they’re 40 minutes away. We would have no help. And no backup. At least now with my job at a non-corporate restaurant, my boss ensures my safety. 

People are tired of getting treated terribly
Im in Illinois & our Governor is pandering to the Prez’s policies. It may be because you’re in a Republican state. I hate to think of it that way, but it seems to be the narrative these days.
The two party system won’t end until a bloody revolt takes place.  Poor attempts have been made in the past.  Witness the effort still being exerted by our “representatives” toward condemning the actions on 1/6/21.

And you’ve all been told the entire affair was “despicable”.  “Treasonous”.  

All I can call that day is misguided and poorly executed.

This is the problem today. No one want to have a real conversation. You just want to assume that I’m some Boomer watching Fox News. Here’s the truth: I don’t need to justify my thoughts or who I am to you.
That Putin is no good. My haircut went up $10.00 since February.

Yes. This has happened throughout history. Once the slaves start understanding they are slaves, either revolt or war starts. Every time.

There will not be any rise ups.

The elites just realized they can shut down entire segments of the economy and the population is too demoralized, lacking all backbone and addicted to too many vices in order to do anything.

We are heading into a multi-generational new dark age, something difficult to describe as the vocabulary does not exist yet. Its a type of neo-feudalism.

The poor have absolutely no moral vocabulary to even describe the problem they are facing and by that they will be unable to generate anyform of leadership baring a divine intervention.
Within the next 10-20 years the average American will barely be able to afford basic amenities and to sustain them self if this continues on the current path. It’s sad because now is the time to act instead of waiting for it to go to shit.

>Stocks aren’t just something that people can bid up higher forever regardless of price. 

Of course they can especially with low interest rate and QE. Except it will not be in inflation adjusted terms. The [Ponzi nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Az1dpnC4AxA) of capital gains makes the impossible possible. Nobody in the west really cares about cash flow nowadays since companies can get away from paying little to no dividends. If dividend is valued more than capital gains, then perhaps this massive ponzi scheme would then finally get exposed. You can't pay a dividend when there is no profit.

>When rich people have more money, they bid up prices on things such as luxury products and financial assets.

Not all luxury products are equal though. An item can be considered a luxury product but if rich people don't really desire it due to some reasons, they are not going to bid up the price. Perhaps something like a used sports car is a luxury product but the rich probably would pay extra for it.
The problem with free float fiat money is there is no \*objective\* measure of value connected to it.

Because of that the banking system can inflate the amount of dollars arbitrary by lending them at whatever price is deemed the 'market'. They use an arbitrary concept like market forces while ignoring that there is SOMEONE in that very market, its not just a magicball that produces the prices. They also lend against whatever assets they please, usually these are existing assets like real estate. The entire economy then becomes a real estate economy etc.

Inflation is a result of 2 things. 1) deadweight overhead processes imposed into the cost structure, ie landlords raise rents, bondholders demand more payments out of a utility which is forced to raise prices, shareholders want more dividends etc 2) entropic decay of infrastructure from lack of innovation due to a debased workforce. For example an ageing powerplant running on some ancient technology that is constantly patched up as it uses up more inputs to produce lower outputs. A overloaded bridge that slows down traffic causing persistent delays.

So dead weight markup + crumbling infrastructure causes inflation. Its not a mysterious force like economists claim.
Somethings going to have to happen, this is not sustainable. $20 an hour is not nearly enough for a highly trained professional. That’s terrible.

Totally, it's like extinction level events for the 1%, very few make it through. When you take a look at the ultrawealthy of the world, it's amazing how openly they're preparing for it though. They're all getting dual citizenships, massive yachts, etc. They know it's coming and they're insulating themselves. Heck Bill Gates became the largest private owner of farmland in the US out of nowhere.
Very cool correlation

Are you talking about the pandemic? Because if you are you should know that the herd's response to the pandemic would've been about the same effect.

https://syndromictrends.com/

There is no government policy that caused that reduction from the end of Feb to June. People did it all on their own. You can look all through last year and see where ever an outbreak of COVID happens, there is a natural inclination of people to isolate, reduce exposure, reduce risk, etc... The shutdowns were just a formality really effecting the outliers who were too arrogant or stupid to look out for themselves and others.
I hope we aren't waiting for God to take interest before acting.

I should have worded that more clearly. I didn’t mean regardless of price in terms of dollars. I meant price in terms of the valuation and how much it costs in real terms, not nominal. In terms of dollars, I agree, stocks can go up forever
Most of the SP500 firms have been financialized. For example take Boeing. Last year they sold $30 billion of debt and they sold $60 bil of their 'side business' which is making planes.

The proceeds from the debt sales go into sharebuybacks, which increases the EPS faster than innovating new planes. Over the last decade they spent more on sharebuybacks than investments into the core business. This is how companies who are relatively stagnant can deliver share price returns. University economics looks at past returns and produces a median which then they forecast the future with, completely \*ignoring\* the principle of WHY and WHERE do the profits come from.

What happens is as the stock goes up there is new nominal financial IOU's being created with no backing in the creative economy. When these IOU's are then spent into the economy its a form of looting, hence you get this bizaare looking society where one guys house costs $50 million and all around him are shacks and potholed roads. This is very similar to what society looked like in the excesses of the dark ages.

Now since the majority of wallstreet 'gains' are in the form of gambling and not value-creative work, when the finance guys spend money they have no concept of what it is worth. Its like a lotto winner. The money becomes so abstract that it is worthless in the minds of the gamblers.
People frequently question why we have a shortage of nurses in the USA.  I was an honor grad from my school of nursing,  I had 10 years of experience when my current place of employment hired me. They were paying 17.50 and have to their credit increased my pay since then but I am one of the few that seems to expect yearly wages to increase.  It's sad to see so many young people who are very interested in working to be the butt of scornful remarks on tv etc. ( No one wants to work anymore. )  and (I bet you still live in your parents house. ) what they should be saying is why doesn't corporate america want to pay reasonable wages anymore and why can't full time employees afford housing and health care? I mean,  damn.
No. Not even any store like that
I agree with you.

Governments are not pro-active, they are reactive, especially in oligarchal models. What caused people to isolate was the massive fearmongering by the media. The same news stations played the same videos the same photos over and over again. People began responsing not with \*reason\* but with their fear, meaning they began acting irrationally which was reflected in the confusion the government than produced. ie military helicopters flying over forests

&#x200B;

The elites realized that weve had decades of attacks against REASON itself, attempting to get rid of it, making the population extremely vulnerable to out of control passions. This all manifested itself in the mass hysteria lockdowns.

If even a slight majority of the population knew how to think, and knew how to apply that reason to reality ie pratical morality we would't have a mass hysteria event.

12 months before the pandemic people were talking about 1 thousand genders existing and men marrying men. This was the IDEAL conditions where hysteria could take root and flourish.

&#x200B;

During the previous pandemic some 10-15 years ago you had the same group attempt a mass vaccination event but it petered out because you still had some REASON left in the population.
The only action you can do now is demand the government 'wall off' Wallstreet. That is impose regulations that seperate gambling from actual economic development. This would mean deflating the prices of nominal assets of virtual rich people while simultaneously inflating the real economy via wages and major infrastructure projects.

You need to create a type of playpen where the sociopaths can go and screw each other over \*without\* affecting the real economy. Let Buffet, Gates, Soros etc all sit and bet against each other \*walled\* off from the rest of us.

Let them use their own private bank to finance the bets, not the commercial banking network of the nation. This means a dramatic reduction in margin lending, mortgage lending, derivatives etc.

Do you see any political party that even understands this dynamic? The leftist ideologues demand higher \*nominal\* wages and the corporate elites are FINE with that because it doesnt matter if I give you $10 or $100 per hour if I can raise your mortgage payment, rent, insurances, bills. I \*get\* all the money anyway.

The second thing that needs to happen is impose mandatory LIFE/ death penalty sentences for CEOs of banks that actively assist in laundering drug money. That would stop the drug trade in a second.

The third thing you need to happen is a total rehaul of the utterly lowgrade educational system that exists.
God is always interested.
jeSuS taKe thE WHeeL
It sure seems like it should have increased more than that by a lot, I wonder if wages would be more commensurate with your skill level if you were someplace with a big medical center like Houston
>What caused people to isolate was the massive fearmongering by the media.

It wasn't fear mongering though and fear is not always irrational. This virus wasn't bullshit, 30% of those infected with symptoms had symptoms long after they got better. The virus can cause permanent damage to the heart and lungs. And of course people died, young healthy people too. Then you have the whole fiscal aspect, who wants to get infected and potentially spend days or weeks in a hospital? I know I'd rather have that money than give it to a hospital. 

It's all risk assessment for the individual that drove this behavior, and there is logical and rational reasoning to support that behavior, even if it is fear induced. But my main point in responding to you was to simply say that even if government did nothing, sectors of the economy would've suffered greatly from this change of behavior. The lockdowns were a formality, and states that did not lockdown that ended up having outbreaks caused people regardless of beliefs and ideology to react accordingly in their own self interest, except for the outliers.
“Military helicopters flying over forests”

What does this mean? Is this a common phrase? Or something that happened? Eli5
https://youtu.be/-UZDRfmYibg
That would probably help.  We have two local hospitals.  One is a rural smaller complex and the other is a regional medical center.  The regional medical center is about to be purchased by some company because they cannot keep the place staffed.  More than 60 percent of their nurses are contractors/ travel nurses.  The other smaller hospital has a terrible reputation in the community and only poor people or dire emergency patients will go there if given any choice.  No,  that's not sour grapes on my part,  I have never worked there and yes, it's pretty bad.
They took photos from Italy and were broadcasting sensational imagery completely taken out of context. North Italy was in winter and had the following realities. A collapsed healthcare system due to 2 decades of austerity, heavy smog, an extremely aged population and a high chinese population from wuhan due to business ties.

The Italian government needed this crisis in order to get a massive boost of emergency spending, some 330bil USD worth to prop up what was a collapsing economy.

According to a march 2021 Italian government report the median death age is 86 for females and 81 for males with the majority having at least 3 major health issues of which heart disease accounted for 30%.

Neil Ferguson an empericist wrote up a highly flawed computer model which pushed the west over the edge and into full blown lockdowns. UK scientists are on record admitting their massive fearmongering led to a totalitarian state. The entire concept of 'lockdown' came from UK elites who have a feudal mentality and view the population as a 'herd'. They started using terminology from husbandry ie 'herd immunity', 'social distancing' etc.

The elites are on record in complete shock that the population tolerated such dramatic pseudo-scientific totalitarianism.

The general public has been demoralized for decades now, they are unable to form their own opinions on any subject. They began panicking which spread to the authorities(who are just as ignorant as the population). Scientism has repalced science as the decision making process.

If you told people that marrying animals would be OK, they would accept it at this point. This is the mind of slavery, unable to grasp truths.

Pseudo-scientists responsible for killing people in the AIDS over-reaction like Fauci suddenly showed up like cartoon characters.

You had arrogant billionaires like bill gates making public health statements.

Those clever enough, namely the financial oligarchy saw an opportunity to offload bad investments and monopolize the situation.
The government decided it was a pandemic based on arbitrary statistics and health systems had trouble from decades of austerity.  


I agree with you that many people would have stopped going out anyway just like they do during a bad flu season.  


However in this case you had a special group of people becoming extremely wealthy in the hysteria that makes it all the more suspect.
I totally believe you. One of the main hospitals we have here in Houston for poor people is Ben Taub, but this is the largest medical center in the world, with lots of resources, and Ben Taub is a teaching hospital so top-tier residents are working on the poor people while they are being supervised, so you have extra sets of eyes on each patient, a good place to land if you’re poor and sick! I am happy for your community that they have someone like you there to help take care of them, smaller communities and smaller hospitals are going to feel much more impact from a nurse like you and it must feel good to help so many people. But if you ever get sick of it, come to Houston!
You have constructed a false narrative in your own head. It is painfully obvious you are susceptible to conspiratorial thinking and most assuredly lack genuine (real world) perspective. I will share my experience. My wife gave birth to our first (probably only) child last May. We live 100""s of miles from our families so found ourselves as caregivers having to completely isolate to protect our son. Covid affects different people in different ways. Being unable to care for our son with no support due to ill health would have been an absolute disaster. So that is our personal risk profile. Add in all the other young families in a similar position or those who wished to protect their elderly loved ones or just plain have the presence of mind to understand overwhelmed health systems collapse no matter how much money you throw at them and you are quickly in the millions of people acting responsibly to protect themselves, their families and society at large.
Look man, I'm not trying to get in to this with you. I just wanted to point out, based on objective data, how people reacted all on their own, and that would've caused great harm anyway to the economy and various sectors. That's all. :) Peace!
https://youtu.be/9CmOn3AuVVE
Italy is a shitty country  everywhere the gov spends money, there are people that know how to be inefficient and steal some of it. Since everyone steals at any level where he can, you have the highest level of inefficiency you can imagine.

This doesn't impact quality of service because we have infinite money anyway, which means debt over debt... And more debt. Actually more debt that that. Everyone knows there's no way we're paying it back, the interests only are now like 1/6 of the total tax revenue it has become ridiculous.

Yes, I'm italian. Hope I can get out of this shithole soon, before they start seizing money from people's bank accounts (italy is a ""welfare state"" which is a form of corrupt socialism, they can do a law overnight to take 1% from every bank account and you can't do anything about it)
>However in this case you had a special group of people becoming extremely wealthy in the hysteria that makes it all the more suspect.

Why is it suspect? It's easier to make money once you have a significant amount. IE the return on $100 investment vs $10,000 vs %1,000,000. The large the amount the more likely you suffer less losses and larger gains.

Don't get me wrong, the game is rigged this way in the same sense that the casino always wins. Those with all the money make the rules so they have an advantage in the system. But that is ultimately why those with hundreds of millions of dollars typically made a lot of money during the pandemic. That and their access to inside information and expertise.
That's very kind of you to say.  I really enjoy my work and I like to believe that I am making a very positive difference in peoples lives without regard to their bank accounts.  It's getting more and more difficult for young people to live in this area.  Maybe because it's so rural.  Maybe because of the economy as a whole.  The day is fast approaching that I may have nothing left to tie my to this community. If I decide to move,  I will almost certainly move a lot Hahaha.  Houston is one of the areas that I would definitely consider.  On the other hand,  I have a brother in Colorado Springs.  It's a tough decision and I won't know until the time comes.  Notwithstanding,  I plan on taking excellent care of my patients wherever I am.
Underfunded and already previously overloaded health systems  were killing people with ventilators early on because the doctors were behaving irrationally due to the atmosphere created by the mass media.

People were also unecessarily rushing to hospitals due to the \*perception\* of immediate death.
They never 'reacted on their own'. They reacted to a particular narrative that was blasted on the medium they watch or listen too 24/7. This narrative was entirely based on SENSE impressions designed to trigger mass hysteria. Which it did.

The question is \*why\* did they react in that way when exposed to sense impressions. The answer I am giving you is over the last few decades the populations cognitive ability to use reason \*over\* passions has been dramatically reduced.

A cartoon like reality show ensued with so called 'scientists' who look the part being brought in as 'experts' to continue scaring the public.

Had this occured even 20 years ago there would never have been lockdowns.

The government is not pro-active, it does \*not\* set policy, it reacts to narratives set by what we call the 'free market', in this case the corporate media.

Your objective data shows that the coronavirus was largely irrelevant?

People react to a narrative spoon fed to them, not 'on their own'. The only reason someone knows of a covid outbreak is because of a narrow media story.

For example, it is now known fact that covid was most likely in Italy as early as September 2019. Yet the panic \*narrative\* began 5 months later by the corporate owned media, with government reaction coming in a full 6-7 months later. 

People know about the flu every year and rarely do they take precautions \*even in an outbreak area\*. However if I started streaming SENSE IMPRESSIONS of dead people 24/7, they would react to it.
This isnt the first time a pandemic hysteria was attempted. 60 minutes even covers the 70's swine flu fraud. About 10 years ago during h1n1 I believe they tried the same thing, this time they were able to get away with it because of how demoralized the population is.  


The fact is the economy especially the financial system was wobbling already in 2019, they needed a narrative and created one. If the media barely covered this youd think it was just a flu season. The deaths are overstated because of the reactions by governments, many especially in the EU froze their state run health systems which caused procedures to be pushed forward leading to deaths.
It is clear you are impervious to reason. Best of luck.

* https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid

Go ahead and take a look at the US and Sweden for an idea of countries that didn't ""shut down their health systems"". Not that I really believe that is an accurate description of what Europe may have done.

Even my crank liberal friend who was against shutdowns, skeptical of masks, distrustful of the CDC, etc... trusted the YoY mortality data to really see how this virus was effecting us. Definitely NOT a flu season. I also know people who took 3-6 months to fully recover, so not just a regular cold or flu for those people. And my brother was intubated twice. So yeah... definitely not what you are saying here.
I think its you who are impervious. These entire scam has been tried before in the 70's and mid 2000's with H1N1 where they tried to vaccinate everyone.

Does anyone else get a very uneasy feeling about this?,131,https://i.redd.it/72n6xq6jtzr41.jpg,"It is absurd but its also a fairly typical bear market rally - about 50% recovered. Its just been faster and more volatile than usual.

I think the next wave down will be a shocker. Not sure how long to get going though.
Just wait a few weeks. It will crash.
The repo markets were putting 1T in per day nearly all of March. The bailouts of big business. This is just prime example of dollar devaluation. This will get worse and more helicopter money will follow. All they can do is print money.

Well, kids, the bottom is not in yet. We will have some very exciting and very choppy trading through the mid-term election cycle, followed by a huge rally.
You're exactly right. It's as if no one has ever looked at a chart of previous stock market crashes. 

The market crashes... And then it frequently rebounds around 50% what it lost. Then a few weeks or months later, it crashes more, then retraces again, etc.

> Not sure how long to get going though.

A lot of WSB hazardeurs are weeping bloody tears.
This is why we got off the Gold Standard. Its a lot easier to just print money than dig up gold. BTW, they don't print it. They send transactions to the large commercial banks.
The fed and treasury have also never proposed injecting 30% of GDP at one time. This seriously distorts any ""natural"" functions or patterns in the market.
Dead cat bounce.
god my puts hope so.
Why Monday?
People believed in the Fed back in 07/08 too. ""The Fed won't let it happen."" It did.
Mine too
What are your puts?
because i didn't know the markets were closed today for some bullshit holiday so i didn't get to  exit my call option position as planned.
Puts apparently if you read the above comments.
Primarily Lulu and Sbux.  


My thought was we would follow china's example on hard lockdown.  At first restaurants were announced and they dropped 50% in value and Sbux only dropped \~20%.  I figured SBUX would also have to hard close.  


For Lulu, it was a dumb bet and I should of bought those puts for closer to december.  


I bet against Becky and lost.
Remember the crying on WSB when Robinhood was down again for a day, and many got wiped out? And they haven't even seen shorts banned (as several countries have done already), or trading itself getting suspended, for as long as it needs to be.
hehe, That's why i usually avoid interacting with the normie financial system. 

I would have put a lot more money into this position im holding but my risk assessment considers things like clearing house failures and full market shutdowns as probable enough to not risk big money in that system.  My stupid ass didn't notice the scheduled holiday.

Hopefully i can pull out on monday before the magic brrr money i captured in the fake markets disappears ."

The problem is that cash is no longer safe either. We can easily enter a hyperinflation period (QE injections at company level are dangerously close to bring it into circulation rather than dumping them into own stonk purchase), though USD could be perceived as a safe haven, for a while.

This is not a great time to be an investor but an amazing opportunity for traders.
My god. That is me. Even holding cash is losing over 8%. It’s like the markets are now a roulette wheel, and your sustainable retirement future is the green 0/00.
Why retire? Just keep working.
You are losing, -8.5% conservatively from inflation.
Guns won't do well when consumer discretionary gets clobbered unless new crime bill gun ban laws are realistic and drive people to go apeshit buying for pre-ban
Can’t you just hide your crypto earnings?
What if they perma-embargo Belarus and Russia though?  Don't you think it's possible?
Not much room to run further unless inflation keeps hitting hard
Yeah but that beats being down 8% in the market plus another 8.5% on inflation. Market is down year to date, and rate hikes are just getting started.
Mosaic already had lobbied for tarriffs on fertilizer imports and won, prior to the war embargo. Those tarriffs have pissed off farmers who began lobbying to have the tarriffs removed and it will come up for review in June or July. The nato embargo of Russia and Belarus will just lead to the supply getting sold to India and china etc.. which displaces that demand making western production more available for the west so it all balances out, as long as the supply is entering the global market. Russia and Belarus causing price pressure is only if the supply doesn't enter global markets.

If you look at the last super price spike in fertilizer prices in 2007ish a lot of it was caused by collusion between Belaruskali and other fertilizer producers creating a cartel which eventually got broken.

There are not really any production constraints and production can be rapidly ramped which will crash prices. Companies like nutrien(formerly potash corp and agrium) have mines that are just shut down but completely ready to turn on with all the capex already done. 

The one main constraint is nat gas supply from russia to Europe producers of nitrogen fertilizers, if supply is unavailable or priced too high that creates problems for global production.

I have an assymetrical way to play this with big upside and minimal losses if it doesn't work out but it probably can't take big bets because volume is too low. I don't want to publicize it too much so you have to DM if interested so my trade doesn't get front runners or crowded.
Depends. If it were risk free everyone would buy. Certain commodity may benefit from the current geo-political disruptions. Certain commodity may be more correlated to consumer discretion and spending. There are things we need to buy no matter what. But, who knows. Investing always carries risk."

Recent studies show the poor are audited at twice the rate of the wealthy. Easy prey.
Taxation is theft... whether by inflation or theft of your wages or earnings...
*surprised pikachu face*
Did you all forget $600?  Seriously the wealthy can hire and use every tax rule to their advantage legally.  The IRS is overfunded in my book and waste way way to much effort on people or families making  80k a year or less.
The absolute unfairness of the social distribution system
This is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever read. How can you be underfunded when you have the highest funding on earth & run a 1:1 deficit..? You pull money out thin air, all the wealthy people in America cannot make up for that. What they can do is contribute to expand the economy which in turn adds more to it, their massive net worths are tied up in the businesses that keep the country afloat at this point.
Flat tax no loopholes or write offs, all income, all assets: 5 to 10% for low to mid bracket, 20% high income bracket, 25% to the 1%.  Obviously the real percentages wouldn't be this high after real analysis but tax laws shouldn't be complex, you only create the opportunity for fraud then. Refunds are only issued because it was our money in the first place.
The IRS underfunded OMFG…. The entire government is far overfunded. We should move to either a flat rate for all or tax consumption.
Well, look at the medical industry. All taxpayer money that goes into it actually accelerates the disparity. Same thing goes for infrastructure, military, assisted housing; literally all of it will disproportionately funnel more wealth into the hands of the few.
You’re just now learning that Democrats give crumbs to the peasants to keep the elite in power?
This is how socialism works. Funds are needed to cover all the promises made of cradle to grave care.  So taxes are raised and aggressively collected. 

The wealthy have the means to fight or otherwise avoid paying. The poor don’t have the money, or assets, to tax. That leaves the middle class. 

Over the course of only a couple of short decades, the middle class is no more.  What’s left is a society compromised of a few very rich, and many, many poor. 

It has been happening in Latin America for years. And if we allow, it will happen here in the USA as well.
Would you care to point to a couple of the worst examples you can think of? Like the largest sums of money given that you consider pork hurting the middle class.
Yes and the red fascist stopped the gold pattern, causing with nixon all the inflation problems we are seing today.
It absolutely is theft. It was created to rebuild after a war, but then has continued. It will never stop. It is too easy for govt to take it
I'll be lucky to make half that this year
I totally agree with these rates I just say end the loopholes and that would be enough thanks
That's both parties.
You have a very poor understanding of socialism.
The gold standard ended in the 1930's due to volatility and exploitation.  What Nixon did was end the gold exchange.  The dollar wasn't pegged to gold back then.  What was going on is that the dollar became the worlds reserve currency (well the post WWII allies world).  When this happened the US agreed to a standardized rate of exchange for gold.  Due to inflation (mostly due to Vietnam) France decided to cash out, which drained the gold reserve at a really unfavorable rate.  Nixon ended that.  In reality the dollar had nothing to do with gold values outside of a arbitrary exchange rate only applicable to the dollar being used as a reserve currency by nation states.
It would stop, or at least reformed, if the middle class united with the working class in order to organize tax strikes and direct action.
For one person that is 40k but you get the idea.
Causing usa to start printing money without any thought on what might happend. Causing all the inflation that we see today
🍻
They were doing that before.  That's what caused the crisis, because France was exchanging the their dollar reserve for gold at something like $35/once rate when gold was $60+ dollars per once.  Again.  The value of the dollar had nothing to do with the value of gold since the 30's when the gold standard ended.  

Inflation also isn't just about printing money.  It has more to do with where demand meets supply.  That's why we didn't see huge inflation with the 2008 recovery.  Trillions were printed, but the dept crises kept demand in check while stimulus was primarily geared towards inflationary spending to prevent deflation with the lower demand. Today, is a whole different beast.  Less dept, less daily expenses, work from home, blanket stimulus, supply chain issues and the covid response has pushed demand far beyond supply, which causes inflation."

In all seriousness I would say if and when anything results in economic collapse, it would be how we, as a consumer culture, live on a diet of debt to finance our lifestyles. This became predominant by the late 20th century because before that point, westerners could more easily afford Gold and real estate and people would not assume as deep of debt to do this. But we normalized debt as being healthy and now most people don’t own SH*T. The bank owns everything and we just suck off it. This is dangerous because it collectively exerts a vacuum or void force on the economy… and that force erodes our ease of access to just about everything as the entire mathematical equation seeks to even itself out. 

It may take a big reset followed by a change in financial morals to change this. 

I’m not saying I am exempt from these adverse behaviors although I’ve always been pretty low income and never could afford a house even, but I would buy cars I should not buy, and part of it is our culture which influences me, to say nothing of ADHD

Events of Jan 10 1987
Black Monday - stock market collapse in Oct. 87.  True story.  When this happened, I was an MBA student at NYU (a the time the MBA school was on Wall Street).  My 9 AM class was literally on reducing investment risk - the teacher walked in, said none of it worked, and walked out.  Never saw him again.
Hello Ape

Good for you for just going for it.  I’m going to take a stab at it too at some point
This is so true. We have been conditioned to be debt slaves and that must change for us to have a healthy sustainable society.
>This became predominant by the late 20th century because before that point, 

There was not that much to buy before that period overall.
When the Cold War was on and the Euro did not exist? 

- history does not repeat, it rhymes though
I'll bet in '87 you almost never said the word, literally.

take a stab at what?
I’m not sure what you mean. I think maybe in 1840 there was not that much to buy overall. But by the 1940s and 1950s the industrial revolution and consumer capitalism had stocked store shelves because the new era offered lots of economic opportunity. I think for a long while things were prosperous this way but then financial practices coincided with cultural values changing to promote more and more of this consumption and larger real estate which is what I am claiming has gone on to put unnecessary stress on the economy and peoples budgets.

I like todays nice and safer cars though… I bet we could have them for $12,000 new if they were much less safe or uglier… but with real estate I think we could make a lot of sacrifices which would improve economics that’s just my thought.

I do not claim to know when it will implode. I'm simply calling out the dominos are falling.
Yeah but either way you and I were super not around during this era so it’s harder to report exactly what all was going on, except to verify that my grandfather had a much different relationship with money than we do. “If you can’t pay for it with cash you can’t afford it” was his MO. He wound up a millionaire, but that money was spent before ever making it down to me of course.

My dad.. the boomer generation, lived as though money grew on trees. Spend spend spend and debt debt debt. That’s how the boomers operated, unlike my grandfather, and is partly why none of this millionaire money was invested and none of it was left by the time I came of age.

If you’re old enough, you can remember the 1990s was all about total economic optimism and cultural expectation was well established that people should get the nicest stuff possible and pay for it using debt. That behavior was continued in my generation and all I ever knew when I came of age was exorbitant rent prices and huge debt for driving a car. I suppose genetically, ADHD or otherwise, I was not outfitted with a mind or upbringing that would lead to making wise financial decisions, but then again I’m partly convinced that such a thing wasn’t even an option by the time I was old enough to care.

The cultural push in Americans to go deep into debt as the late 20th century progressed… I believe this ultimately eradicated affordable options for housing because it exerted a vacuum force on purchasing power. If everyone is in debt people are going to need to charge more for stuff since they calculate that much of it isn’t going to wind up being paid for anyway.

Nice cars are part of this as well, although I do defend designing cars to be safer in crashes with safety tech and side airbags etc etc… although even that is being squandered because people now drive more carelessly than ever and fatalities have risen back to a mid 2000s high. The safety of vehicles has been offset by behavior. Cars being extremely expensive is a problem, but like I said I have a soft spot here because if we can get a new car for $10,000 it will be a death trap.
No! Im def aware of how much, like 95%, of real news is purposefully unreported. But in the financial world its more difficult. And this is a story that has been reported on before.
I don’t think The rest of the world has to worry about Evergrand - that is a CCP PROBLEM - someone is getting the Xi firing squad - they better hit the airport or docks"
Is it just me or does everything related to the “economy” end up punishing the working poor?,92,https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/10/28/used-car-prices-chip-shortage/,"Money printing punishes the working poor, which everyone supports without voicing support, even the working poor.

You either have money printing(theft) or you have collapse. This is how the system is designed.

In order for the zero-sum gambling economy to work, there must be a coordinated attack on wages. Why? Nominal gambling debts require the money supply to increase. To prevent a total hyperinflation, labor costs have to be controlled.  


When economists talk about ‘inflation’ it never means rich people assets which can inflate double digits forever, they mean poor people assets which is labor.
By design I believe
Certainly you don’t expect politicians or their wealthy donor friends to be ‘punished’ do you.
You get what you vote for… suck it up buttercup…if you believe in more government control, the poor are only going to suffer more…
The poor will always be punished because they don't have the resources to weather an economic storm. The old saying is true, it's expensive to be poor. Everything economic related is an issue if you don't money.
Yes its deliberate!  They make the rules!  They show us a carrot but we are actually getting entraped.
I particularly love the FED chair saving we have to hold wages steady.  At rates far below levels one can live.  It is bizarre to listen to him.
Globalization even in the infancy of capitalism was something Marx pointed to as a bastardization of international solidarity. Not to mention he predicted the outcomes of capitalism such as instability and collapse of modern society. Value today is determined by scarcity and demand both of which are manipulated by capitalists. These are systemic issues which define capitalism existed early on and created the early labor movement. Recently again as regulations and wages stagnant has it created another push for change. 
(For the definition of capitalism it is the private ownership of the forces of production, with markets being an agreed upon medium of exchange. Without a medium of exchange whether it’s agreed upon value or currency private property becomes difficult to value. Which is why medieval communes dominated briefly under feudalism when the empire of Rome collapsed.)
Globalization and complacency, per usual, has fucked us all.

What next?
Yeah capitalism has fucked us, I’d recommend a cure for capitalism by Dr. Richard Wolff. He’s a market socialist and I think he provides the most pragmatic and realistic alternative.
I've followed Richard wolffe fairly closely over the last few years. I really like a lot of what he has to say.

Having said that, if you think he is the answer, we're all truly fucked
.
No I think revolution is needed I just refer to his blueprint for a more egalitarian society.
His version of society also requires force. Humans have tried organizing via force for ten thousand years+. Maybe it's time to try something different?
Such as? Political power is derived from the barrel of a gun or tip of a sword

You ignored most of what I said. Would you define the initiation of force for me?

> Revolution against oppressive forces is never an unjust form of violence so long as it’s in self defense.

Did I say it was? Please stop having conversations in your own head and stay on topic.
“Behavior which uses force to get what a party wants” you’re saying that revolution would be immoral because it uses intimidation against capitalists right?
You're assuming I'm interested in a revolution. They're tired, old. Fuck a revolution.

Inflation is b*ll$hit,84,https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/sqymzf/inflation_is_bllhit/,"There was inflation then too. 800 billion dollar stimmy in 2009 was quite a lot back then. Then they did QE for like 10 years and that caused more but it was gradual. Now they've printed 35% of the existing dollars within the past 2 years. That's a HUGE shock. It's not some conspiracy.
It depends which part if the economy that money is going to. If the bailout money went immediately into consumer goods, then you'd see prices rise for consumer goods.

As it went into the high levels of venture capital and banking of all sorts, that money might take a few years to work its way into the working class, at which point it would effect the prices for consumer goods so it wouldn't do the working class any good anyways.

Tl;dr: that kind of inflation of the money supply helps established big capital in the short term and harms the working class in the long term
[deleted]
This inflation wasn’t caused by the $1400 check. It was caused because they over stimulated using monetary policy. Companies got at least 8 trillion minimum in bailouts.  not including high yield bonds borrowings etc.. The inventory shortages are not solely driven by customers but rather companies to have inventory in stock. In order to create inventory, they binge borrowed and caused this inflation situation. It was a policy error by both the central banks( all around the world) and governments. They just blame it on you so you don’t riot like after 2008, with a $2000 bribe.
Hi OP. There was massive inflation on Wall Street when the Federal Reserve and congress bailed out Wall Street. If you look at the stock market (and the housing market, corporate profits, etc) over the last 15 years you'll see it. 

Very little of that money hit Main Street, so inflation for everyday spending did not spiral out of control. 

The last two years were different. Yes, they bailed out Wall Street again causing the stock market to shoot WAY up....we have all seen what it's done to housing as well. But this time, especially with the second and third stimulus/bailout bills, lots of money flowed to Main Street as well. Most Americans were sent checks in the mail. Unemployment was extended and many people were given money above their own regular wages. Benefits for those with children. Paying rent for people who couldn't pay their rent. Etc. etc. 

And then there are the supply chain issues caused by the pandemic. 

tl;dr - The inflation isn't a lie. But the Federal Reserve created these conditions knowing that it hurts the poor the hardest. They are evil bastards.
If you really want any further evidence that inflation is just the rich finding ways to get more of the money, just look at corporate profits over the past couple of years. They have been banking massive profits during the pandemic, while the middle class has shrunk and the impoverished class has grown. The dollar falling in value has nothing to do with stimulus payments and everything to do with greed.
1 trillion in 2008, but it was like 8 trillion during covid + a supply side crisis... so not exactly the same.
broad money vs base money. Japan has expanded base money through QE for years with little inflation. We expanded broad money supply while simultaneously shutting down production of goods. This is how you get inflation.
Some of the printed money went to foreign investment, so that gets the new dollars outside the U.S. which delays the inflationary effects for a while. As well as the effect of the dollar still being the primary world currency so it helps with the saying of ""a rising tide floats all boats"" where the u.s. stays better off than most other countries with their inflation and debt in comparison globally. But all the same, it's fake money, just the gov't treasure selling bonds and taken more debt based on value the country doesn't have.
Idiot here ^^^

Stay clear.
No shit.
Inflation after 2008 was in asset prices-- stock market and real estate.  Otherwise, we would have experienced another Great Depression or a Lost Decade (Japan).

Consumer Price Inflation is partly caused by shortages in fossil fuels, fertilizer, natural gas, semiconductors, etc.-- lockdowns are an issue we didn't have after 2008.  Some landlords are trying to recoup costs from the lockdowns/ rent moratorium.  China and Russia might be trying to create inflation in Western economies as economic warfare to create unrest, riots and even civil war.

In other words, it's complicated.  Even the Fed doesn't understand inflation or get it right all the time.  The good news is that the Fed plans to raise rates and tighten while economic growth slows /s
Inflation and hyperinflation take years to gestate.

Where was inflation after 2008 and over a decade of QE?

It was in asset prices.


Why are we getting inflation now?

Because of Bidens demand side policies that sparked consumer spending.
actually, it isnt bullshit at all.
What are democrats helping  ,  nah ,  more sanctions tariffs. ,, like they say.         Helping Americans families.            What hogwash
Every bailout represents theft against future working class taxpayers. Take from them and put it into the pockets of those who f’d everything up. Nice move. Politicians, both sides, only represent the 2%ers. F this.
This, OP.
mass indulgence in war surplus
Or war doesn’t come. ENTER: Currency Crisis
You call this capitalism?
Inflation was caused by stimmy checks as well. Consumer spending popped after all the Biden bucks were sent out.

We learned an important lesson from all this. Any form of UBI will never work and we can't send people checks in the mail again. 

Also we need people to start paying back student loans.
Yes it was. Inflation was project to be transitional at a rate of 2% however injecting monies increasing more demand is one reason causing inflation to jump to 7.5%. Bailouts were always given to big companies yet we didnt see such high inflation.
this ^ kaboom
Yup.
First search the definition of income. Then search the definition of Universal Basic Income or UBI.
The rescue bucks ($1400) were neither income nor UBI. 
Inflation is caused by the stimulus check, $1400. Yeah I love my $1400 car and $1400 house is so comfortable and spacious. 
You must be trolling if you really believe that bs.
Look, I was super in favor of the stimuli, but you don't think they caused inflation? So many households saved the first one then blew the second one, it truly did have a big effect on supply.
Okay, sure I suppose that’s the reason why the Australia is facing 15% inflation and New Zealand and Canada and everywhere else in the world. How much stimmy did they get from Biden again ?
The whole western world followed more or less the same policies, to greater or lesser extent"

Underwater on mortgage meaning house value is less than the debt? That's wild considering most probably put 20% down, right?
What did they expect!?! Idiots!!!
Shocker🙄🙄🙄
Yeah, during the pandemic, the people who bought the house next door to ours said they were allowed to go up to something crazy like 54% of their gross salary on the mortage they were allowed to take out and basically maxed that out to get the most house for the money they could get.  That was before inflation on everything.  And before everybody's insurance going up substantially because of the massive numbers of insurance companies pulling out of the area.  I just don't understand how people were allowed, and even encouraged to do this.

They are firmly set against pivoting until something seriously breaks, or so the last few month's narrarive has gone. 

Historically, even after a pivot, the economy continues to downturn for months to years.

Crypt0_sports is right, we are at the end of the line when it comes to printing our way out of trouble and leveraging debt against more debt.
I didn't think FHB was used that often, but yeah that would make sense
5% downs means higher mortgage payments + PMI. I just figured most people wouldnt be able to afford that
""down the road"" is irrelevant to most politicians.
All we have to do is raise the debt ceiling again? But wait, when the FDIC guarantee is worthless then what?
Thank you & definitely agree
Exactly. FDIC only has \~120 Billion to cover losses which is nothing compared to the trillions in banks. We can raise the ceiling and print as much as we want, but we still have to deal with the debasement of currency as a result.


It’s my understanding that qualitative easing equates to roughly 20% of our national debt. The real money is in the feds lending money to property buyers that has “already been paid for”. Kinda where the original “Federal (Reserve)” idea came from (which all three reasons are at major risk). Unfortunately this lending has been squandered long ago and true liquidity ended in the Great Depression. The gig was up in 1944 when we paid off all the worlds banks by the IMF. After a couple decades of stability we went off the gold standard increasing the “debt limit”. On that day we, as a nation, were sold out! Do you remember Nixon’s quote “I am not a crook”? How poetic was he. We’ve been pilling up a Ponzi scheme that will possibly end life on earth. So be it!

Sure. But this is inviting an avoidable logistics nightmare of having to print banknotes on short notice and delivering them to the banks. Just like toilet paper stocks being wiped out. The analogy is carrying further, because the amount of existing currency as claim on existing resources and future output of the economy guarantees it about the same value. And panic resulting from widespread realization of this will be something to behold.
clearly tomorrow
Im honored, fishy.
>Just like toilet paper stocks being wiped out. The analogy is carrying further, because the amount of existing currency as claim on existing resources

Toilet paper is not a good example because it is skyrocketing in value on the black market. hehe

They should print wider triple-ply dollars to stop the toilet paper from taking over as the reserve currency.

Thus approaching the value of banknotes."

Hasnt been true for a very very long time. If ever. 

Work smart, not hard.
I feel like if you're living in a rural area, that dream is still alive.  But if you're in a major city where everyone wants to live and you're all competing for limited resources / property, you're basically SOL.
A milk man (dead career) was able to make enough money delivering milk (what a concept lol) in 1940/50s and be able to support a wife that didn’t work and a family of 4+ kids. 

A similar job today as a delivery driver (whose industry will be AI dominated in a decade or less) can’t even pay a rent. 

Yes… sadly working hard for a company gets you no where these days (unless you are in upper management etc. and even then it’s a stretch)
That's because it doesn't.
I'm had jobs that payed me good money and I've had hob tHar payed me very little. I worked a lot harder at the job that payed me poorly than the ones that payed me well these two things do not match up anymore. The more money you make the less hard you work it's facts
Ehhh, my parents, when they were my age lived in a time when working hard would actually get your enough to not be upset about your situation.  Neither has college education and made off like bandits compared to myself.  Built their house with cash and in the poor midwest it is worth $400k. Always had multiple cars.  Sister and I got to do travelling sports and have nice things and take vacations.  Always more than enough food for me to have friends stay over and blow through boxes of Little Debbies and frozen pizzas. 

Could it have been better for them?  Probably, but did hard work pay off?  More for them than it does for me.
Not ever? 

My grandparents worked simple jobs: grandfather was a parts installer for a company that made medical trucks and my grandmother worked graveyard shifts at a pen factory. They were able to buy a house in CT for $9000 (mortgage was $21 a month) they raised seven kids, put them all through college…. 

I work 70+ hour work weeks and can’t even afford my rent off that $$. Lol. Investing is the only thing keeping my bank account growing…

Things were definitely better or at least more obtainable back then
But isn't the catch that there are limited avenues for obtaining capital due to lack of decent paying jobs, despite the lower cost of living?
SOL?
My parents wonder why I don't buy a house which I then can fill with nice furniture and build a nice pool and own a nice car... They're like ""Of course you can pay for that, you do work right?"". Quite depressing how much worse off we are today than our parents generation were when they were our age.
Yea you are right I think. My grandpa was a truck driver and able to be sole provider for the family back then. Although still, I think things got a lot better for him once he learned the industry and started his own trucking company.
Maybe on one hand yes, but it’s also easier to be your own boss than ever before, so I’d say it depends on what you want to do where you should live
Shit Outta Luck
You know, my Mom has said to me a few times that she is sorry, and that she would hate to be my age today.  They bought 10 acres of land.  They borrowed against their house and it was for $105k.  With their credit and all that, the monthly payment is like $450 or something very low.  She was throwing a fit.  When I explained to her that kids these days trying to get over-inflated priced houses with bad credit from the healthcare and school industries bending them over a barrel, typically they would see like $1k on a $105k loan a month.  I think she gets it.  My Dad denies they had it so good.  Says we are a touch entitled because they didn't discipline us like his parents did him.  Typical shtick from a boomer.
I’m always surprised at hearing this, because all someone needs to do is a little bit of basic math to understand why it’s not possible to buy a house. 

I often wonder how much of it is stupidity and how much of it is denial. To be honest, I think in many cases denial is a bigger factor. Denial is a beast that can easily dominate emotional decision making to protect one’s identity. It’s scary to say the least.

Thought this was Manhattan
Honest question- how do these people fund their habits? Sex work for some surely, but what about the rest?
The permanently dependent class was created intentionally by the government.
Some people's life ambition is to do drugs all day, we should stop making it illegal and ruining their lives over it.
They are lucky they aren’t in China.
Legalization could help? Idk maybe not, but maybe so
Freeloaders issue is not going to end until welfare ends.
Legalization will absolutely work. Countries with legalized drugs are doing better. Besides, the war against drugs is a war that has been lost for thousands of years around the world.
Yes, Philadelphia, however, they are number of other cities that have the same problem where the block looks just as worse. It’s an epidemic.
“Crony” lol. Capitalism will always be crony unless it’s heavily regulated, which means its closer to socialism than capitalism.
The needles usually come from a State-sponsored needle exchange programs but sadly the drugs are gained in a degrading and dehumanizing manner
Who's paying for their drugs? The people who's property they steal. Let them OD, then trench burials, haul their crap to the dump and let working people have their neighborhoods back. There is zero redemability here, only liability and chaos.

Doesn't matter what city it's in.  If our authority & government are obviously OK with the state of citizens as we see here, and times are decent not great but decent.  What will they allow and condone when things get bad?  Imagine if a political party had the ability to cut off 90% of the drug (opoid I assume) supply, in what state would many individuals be in?
All “ism”s are susceptible to cronyism. Where are they not?
Legal drugs are also far cheaper, while being of known strength and purity. Think Amsterdam. No ODs, and people can hold down a job while indulging in their free time.
Crazy, I also thought it was Kingsbridge. What clued me in what the blue instead of green under the train.
I thought it was portland; I was trying to identify by the bridge but camera moved too fast to tell.
Thanks for the location. Once again, it’s sad that a city could have been singled out due to the fact that it’s an issue in all major cities.
How is that possible? The government may not be capable of stopping it.  Meth can be made and fentanyl is so easily accessible I cannot conceive a way to stop it. Maybe just keep sharing these images and people will wake up and teach their kids. The 90’s they tried DARE but it had little affect. I don’t remember it being this bad though.
Not with fentanyl you can't.
You can. Fentanyl is one of the cheapest drugs ever made, quite obviously, and it's not like the high lasts for days, which is the only way you could not possibly hold down a job.

It's not much different from heroin in terms of high length, yet I've seen a very interesting studying looking at doctors that were addicted to heroin in the USA and were therefore able to prescribe themselves heroin.

Because they had a legal, cheap source of known strength, they were able to hold down a very demanding job just fine by indulging in their off time.
Because cities or states where drugs are legal or decriminalized have less homeless and less crime… 🙄


Also any doctor prescribing themselves a painkiller would lose their license within a month.

Stagflation coming soon?,78,https://i.redd.it/wwk9nxqgug861.png,"The problem with the theory that we'll see a severe inflation spike is that it assumes that the future is like the past.  


The missing ingredient we have is demand.  It's not quite clear that people have the means to continue spending on a discretionary basis - thus, demand may not be available to create the classic ""more dollars chasing fewer goods"" like we saw in prior periods of inflation.  


It's likely that we'll see inflation for products and services that are energy or natural resource intensive, since we're being constrained by the laws of nature / physics, and that we'll see deflation for non-energy or resource intensive products and services.  


Food will be the biggest piece of the puzzle (inflation), in my opinion, balanced on the other side by clothing (deflation).
Just more degenerate monetary policies by your overlords at your Privately Owned Central Bank.

Get on your knees for the Federal Reserve.
It looked similar after the great recession. The Fed puts government bonds and maybe some other assets on its balance sheet. This is offset by the creation of bank reserves. It doesn't work to produce hyperinflation but instead stimulates risk seeking because investors go on a hunt for yield (banks reserves yield nothing unless Fed is paying IOER).

This seems to be why the financial markets have gone into an endless spiral of historic risk taking. Its anyones guess how or when it will end.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1
Stagflation will never be recognized by the govt because:

* The inflation stats are rigged to remain at 2% forever. 
* Unemployment is rigged to remain low. Any spike in unemployment will be reclassified as ""discouraged workers"" who are no longer part of the labor force. 
* Stagflation? High unemployment and high inflation? Honest reporting on most people's financial state? *Never heard of it.*
I saw something the other day that the fed was worried they wouldn't be able to stimulate enough inflation.

 Seems they even considered doing the stimulus as a sort of public bit coin and opening everyone in the us an account, in order to be able to use negative interest rates.

Perhaps if anyone cares I'll look for a link tomorrow, going to bed now.
So the reason we have a coin shortage is because we have too many dollars. Got it.
Hyperinflation and instant power outage more likely
Meltdown like the world has never seen. Run for the hills
The missing ingredient we have is the totally bogus, manipulated CPI numbers. 

* It doesn't account for shrinkflation
* It has introduced nonsense ""hedonic adjustments"" since the late 90s to keep the number low
* It is modeled after a middle class America, one in which there aren't a huge number of people on the brink and incapable of spending without inviting financial ruin

The inflation stats are fake.
> It doesn't work to produce hyperinflation

Yet.

Hyperinflation is caused by a crisis of confidence, or lack thereof. A widespread belief that a country's central bank is abusing its privilege with the money printer. It tends to happen all at once, and comes out of nowhere. Most hyperinflationary episodes in history last only about 6 months, including the famous Weimar Germany example. 

The world still has confidence in the US dollar. It's the reserve currency. What could replace it?

But... What if we all wake up one morning, and the dollar is plunging for no reason, and then there's a scramble to get out of the dollar? You'll never see it coming.
why power outages though?
Of course.  I'm talking about actual demand.  It's disappeared.

There are plenty of middle-class Americans, contrary to your statement.  It's simply that disposable income doesn't mean what it used to - not because evil corporations, etc. blah blah... but because energy is more expensive.  Not in dollar terms, but in real joules / units of work terms.
Uh what do you think Bitcoin is there for?
Hyperinflation causes all currencies to become worthless which means the trucks stop, oil no longer gets pumped out of the ground and power stops getting produced. I wouldn't be surprised if those in power run to their bunkers when the dollar hits 85 dollars as that is likely the point where it just falls to zero
Bitcoin will be crushed in a hyperinflationary episode.

Once hyperinflation happens, central banks almost universally unveil a brand new currency to replace the old one. It won't be Bitcoin, because the Fed can't control it. It will be FedCoin, exchangeable at $1T = 1 FedCoin.

Bitcoin will be taxed or outlawed.
Naw. Bitcoin is the replacement to put heat off the dollar. https://youtu.be/7vl_ziH6OJo

Today, you might buy a good from the U.S. (whatever that might be) for $1.00. Once prices adjust, the price of that underlying good might be raised by up to 15%, i.e: $1.15. The alternative is that the firm does not adjust the sale price, but endures financial lost in the short-term because of foreign exchange costs.

In short, your buying power against the dollar has shrunk.
example of what
Tell us about the nukes too. for old times sakes
but how does the dollar going up affect a domestic good. $1 = $1
Assuming the materials needed to make that good all came from US why would the product be $1.15 because AUD went down?
My response specifically says 'you might buy a good from the U.S' and 'your buying power against the dollar has shrunk.' A product which is exclusively produced in Australia will remain roughly the same price, so long as any components of the product or service do not need to be imported or developed in-part outside of the country.

Give it time, it’ll happen soon enough. Especially in the energy/fracking and retail sectors.
Yes, I do believe that. Even in the absolute depths of the 2008 financial crisis, we *never* had the sort of total economic shutdown that is happening now. Entire sectors of the economy are being shuttered indefinitely,￼ which collectively employ tens of millions of people - transportation, tourism, hospitality, food service, retail, movie + arts, etc. 

Businesses have never faced a total collapse of revenue in 2 days like they are now, in some areas such as restaurant and movie theaters their revenue is going to near 0. In 2008 a restaurant for instance may have seen revenue collapse to 50% of their previous but not 0%. The lack of cash flow is going to bankrupt thousands of businesses within less than a month and even more if it goes 2 or 3 months which it almost certainly will.

We haven’t seen anything yet. We’ve only seen the stock market collapse, just wait until millions of workers are laid off, major corporations default, the junk bond market seizes up, it goes on and on. 70% of our economy is based on consumer spending. We’ve been thrown into a major recession and it will only continue as the financial crisis really gets underway. 

In addition, the financial system is far more fragile than it ever was in 2008. Non-financial corporate debt is the highest in history. There are massive asset and credit bubbles everywhere you look. The Fed and central banks all over the world are out of monetary policy tools and are left with only a desperate attempt to maintain liquidity in specific parts of the financial markets. As I said, we haven’t seen anything yet, this will get so much worse.
Then you are blind or possibly suffering from dyscalculia.
?
They’ll roll out UBI for 4 weeks. FDA + big pharma will rush out some half-assed vaccine that is probably bad for you in the long run but stops the pandemic. All blame for this mess gets directed at trump. Biden+Hillary ticket wins the gen. Another 100 year continuation of neoliberalism.

Italy’s curve isn’t just flattening, they’re already beginning to eliminate growth at all, let alone exponential growth, after 5 days of quarantine. Rate of information exchange + advance in health care guarantees this will be NO WHERE CLOSE to a Spanish flu scenario.  The projections Goldman Sachs is running with is obvious alarmism to cover their asses

Business as usual
Exactly.. have some faith people!

Except this time we're already at more or less 0% interest rate. For banks to keep lending out money at interest rates below the inflation rate is slow suicide. Our system is not designed for anything except continuous and exponential growth. Nothing was really learned in 08, peeing your pants to stay warm on a cold winter day is not learning, its just postponing and escalating the original problem.
They're printing enough cash to destroy the currencies. This is the lesson they have yet to learn from 2020.
Then why the massive dollar funding stress? Because thats not how money works today.

2008 was a problem of liquidity. This is a problem of actual global productivity decline.
Thank a freemason. They are orchestrating all this to form a one world government. The CEOs who jumped ship all knew this was going to happen, it is a pre-planned event they needed cover to hide what there waste and policies did to the dollar.
I'm not sure what dyscalculia is, but I do know that no fortune 500 company as big as Lehman has collapsed. Not one. So can you please explain what I am not seeing here??? Thanks

**How do I work?** First I read as many new comments as I can and turn each one into a list of noun phrases (things like 'raindrop' or 'brown paper package'). Next I pluralize them and run them through an algorithm to determine the number of syllables each noun phrase contains. If I find that your comment contains three noun phrases of 2 syllables each, one noun phrase of 5 syllables, and one noun phrase of 6 syllables I simply insert them into the lyrics and post them back to you! Finding noun phrases, determining syllables counts, and pluralizing words are all very tricky and I often make mistakes!

Love the expression, fit so many society and system problems.
I like to think of it like a Jenga Tower. If you keep removing blocks, eventually it will topple over. It doesn’t particularly matter which block you pull after a certain point, the thing will eventually come tumbling down. Then you have to pick up all the blocks and rearrange them back into the tower to play again. That’s sort of like what we had in 2008 where a block was pulled (mortgage-backed derivatives) and the entire unstable structure toppled over and it took many years to build the blocks back sort of to where they were (except many areas still haven’t recovered, so it’s not a perfect analogy). 

But the effects of the coronavirus are like soccer kicking the Jenga Tower as hard as you possibly can. Just like you can’t undo the tower falling over by putting the block you took back, you can’t undo the kick if you draw your foot back to where it started. Even if the coronavirus ceases to be much of a problem 3 months from now, which is a reasonable but optimistic projection, the blocks of the financial economy will still be yeeted all over the floor, under your couch, out in the hall - who even knows if you’ll find all the blocks again. The damage will have been done and the financial crisis that ensued will carry on under its own momentum and logic. 

It didn’t take a virus to devastate the economy in 1929 or 2008, it was the financial economy imploding and dragging the real economy with it. Well this time around it’s the real economy that imploded first and it will drag the entire financial economy with it. Once that process starts, removing the catalyst won’t stop the chain reaction. I think this crisis however will be significantly worse than if we had had a different catalyst just because of how massive and sudden the effects of this particular catalyst are, compared to a catalyst of the financial economy crumbling due to business cycle reasons.
The pandemic will have to run its course. The approach of shutting everything down cannot stop a pandemic. It can only slow it down and lead to economic ruin.
It is a problem of productivity, demand, supply, liquidity, you name it.
You are comparing the collapse of an over-leveraged institutions based on paper value to a prolonged guaranteed negative growth period over a period of months & possibly a year or longer.

There is nowhere for the money to go because there is no guaranteed investment.
You don’t have to be a “it’s just the flu” truther to realize that regardless of severity this thing is going nowhere quick due mostly to social media hysteria, let alone medical advances. Spanish flu probably ravaged thru hundreds of thousands before they even knew what was going on. Now, Italy’s death rate is already leveling off after 5 days of quarantine. Not exponentially growing, not even growing. 

Let’s not get ahead of ourselves here. Neoliberalism is not gonna fall this easily

Slowing it down gives hospitals a fighting chance not to be steamrolled like Italy
You do realize that even if we survive this, the pandemic showed that we are literally always on the brink of financial collapse at all times. No matter how ""good"" things appear to be, we are just one huge company or industry failing from our entire economy going into freefall. Economic ruin is a *certainty* in a system that perpetuates never-ending growth, because infinite growth is not possible.
>Now, Italy’s death rate is already leveling off after 5 days of quarantine. Not exponentially growing, not even growing.

Bullshit. What are you talking about?

It is not stagnating. It is growing. Growing less, but still growing
Thats great. They can stay in quarantine forever then.
>Economic ruin is a certainty in a system that perpetuates never-ending growth, because infinite growth is not possible.

I think it has more to do with the extreme short sightedness of the market. They instantly shutdown to save costs, dragging others with them. When it is all over, and we are trying to build it back up, I don't see anyone making the first move so to speak. It will be really slow going to build everything back up again.

In either case, we agree that there are underlying  problems with the system, and the current events have exposed how fragile our economy is.
Death rate increase in Italy has stagnated past two days
Who knows. China seems to be doing alright but I’m not erudite enough to know their economic situation. Independent/small chain restaurants will take a hit but I’m sure the US has plans to techno fix their way out of this
Barring Wuhan China’s getting back to business as usual already. Granted they were much more strict but still

And you just know the FDA + big pharma is moving earth to rush out some techno fix
Going by your logic it stagnated on the 8th and 9th. And then grew. Stagnated on the 11th and 12th. And then grew. Declined significantly from the 13th to 14th. And then grew.

It looks worse if you look at it in terms of percentages.  Historically, zombie companies are at about 1 to 3% (as you would expect).  They're over 20% now. Over. 20. Percent.

This is not just in the US. Interest rates are kept low all across the world by central bankers. They are deliberately keeping all the zombie corporations alive with cheap money. Though on the surface it looks like the central banks are saving ""jobs"" for mainstreet but underneath, they are literally bailing out the wallstreet at the cost of everyone else.

One more thing, Elon Musk is now the 2nd richest person in the world. Fucking crazy times we live in, a single man gaining so much wealth in a global recession. It is like they are not even hiding that central bankers are printing money for the oligarchs.

I feel confident the powers that be will do a ""beautiful deleveraging"" as Dalio likes to call it, AKA inflate it away. 

Otherwise at this pace of Zombification the economy will have as much dead weight as the USSR
With yields pinned to the floor it should be exceptionally easy for income to cover interest expenses.

I think hyperinflation has already been a thing since about 2016 or so - following a deflation event in 2015.  In my area \*mean\* house prices have gone up 100K (!).  Top 20 metros are outta sight now unless you're in that 15% or so of the populace who still have disposable income.
interestingly the inflation is all concentrated in some sectors but not in others.

Most of the housing price inflation was purely from laws that limit housing production combined with low interest rates, 

up until the covid era when actual lumber prices and other input prices shot up almost 200%. Recent lumber price increases alone add another $17,000 material costs to average new house price.

we are seeing more ""cost push"" added to the ""demand pull"" housing inflation."

If you are still in the markets, it is tough to be empathetic. 

Invest in yourself. In productive assets. In education. In a homestead you can use to feed yourself. Whatever. 

Casino obsessions aren't everyone's problem.
So does that mean millennials are so fucked that there is no point in saving for retirement, instead we just train to starve longer so we are prepared when we actually have to.
Can you expand on this to me? I understand that this means short term bonds are more profitable than long term bonds but, what does it mean in terms of the debt. Purchasing government bonds means purchasing government debt, correct? 
Please if you can expand that would be great
Forget the 2Y, have you seen the 1y, 6M, and 3M?
Man, I'm losing losing losing, Joe Bidens slogan now and forever.
Are we at full inversion yet?
I do love checking the markets, though. Having a good chuckle about rich people losing money, yet still obsessed with running on that increasingly pointless hamster wheel.
Even if you invested in all those things you mentioned, wouldn't you (or anyone who is cash flow positive every month) soon have cash piling up which you would need to decide what to temporarily do with? I assume you always have money in your bank account, don't you (if you don't invest in stock markets, gold, etc)? So, isn't that money always at risk of inflation unless you quickly do something with it? 

It's time-consuming to figure out what to spend thousands of dollars on and by the time you've decided, it's already inflated away a lot. I think that's why some people remain invested in the stock market. You can quickly stash money there until you need to buy thousands of dollars worth of tools or education or whatever.
There was already no point in 'saving' for retirement if you mean saving in us dollars. If you aren't at least saving with actual assets, yes, theres no point.

Also, yes, millennials are fucked. I mean, everyone is if you aren't ultra wealthy.
You can be part of the revolutions if you want a chance.

But yes, we will be given nothing during our lives until we get sick enough to throw our lives on the line.
There are opportunities everywhere.   Ibonds, buying sheriff sales fixer uppers, ect.   I am surprised so many people stayed in the market, I was out in Feb 1st.

Just have to hold tight for another 3 to 6 months for a bottom then back in the market
I still think 401K's have alot to offer. I suspect most ordinary folks this is their only way they invest in the market. So you got pretax money, plus most companies offer some amount of matching.
You are correct.

Longer term maturity should pay a higher yield. Not only are the 5 and 10 paying less than the 2 but also the 20 and the 30.
A shorthand is to think of yield curves as a measurement of the people's confidence in those investments (and the underlying system) at various points in the future. For 20 years out to look very uncertain is...dire, to say the least. It's basically markets saying, ""oh yeah, we're pretty much fucked"".
Joe Biden has little to do with it, these problems have been building since Clinton era relaxation of banking laws that created these risks. Of citizens united giving corporation massive power. For sure, I'm not a fan of most in the government, and the trillions in spending under his administration have added to the problem, he's not on the hook for all of it. The causal chain of this problem goes back decades, not to the 2020 election. 

Making it about one party or another only serves the oligarchs. We aregue amongst each other about who in power fucked it up, but the reality is the entire system is rotten. The main job of politicians is to plan and fundraise to get reelected instead of fixing things. 

They use the propaganda machine to keep us focued on the wrong problems.
I don't relish any of it- the gains or losses.  

If you have the intellectual or other resources to invest in your own needs and priorities, it is easy to ""beat the market"", and not ""lose"". 

The casino/market is a huge addiction for too many.
Well, this year, I bought another piece of land. Last year, I funded a startup that is going to do well. And we went halvsies on a CT scanner for the local clinic so we could take ours back home. 

The issue is that yes, eventually when you quit investing (in yourself, via enterprise), you have cash flows that are being deflated unless you get stuff, and when you are our age, you don't need a lot of stuff. So you sink it into things you can liquidate or turn into cash flows later on.
TBF Millennials and Gen Z are extra super fucked as they never collectively had a shot at asset ownership anyway.
Wish I could figure out how to time the market like that.
Just bought some I-bonds. That 9% that is only subject to federal tax is tasty right now
Agreed. I’ll stay on the hamster wheel as long as my company kicks in matching money
So, what does this mean exactly?
So is it better to buy long term or short term
I'm sorry I'm going to say something stupid because I'm financially illiterate.

Is it really that 20 years out looks uncertain?  Or is it that people expect the market to recover and hence are loathe to tie their money up for 20 years?  Which... ok so usually if the market recovers the relationship between stocks and bonds is inverse (??)... so bonds would go down and you'd be forced to sell at whatever the going rate is if you wanted to free up the money to put into stocks, and the going rate would be bad... (??)

I mean I guess... is this kind of a ""wait and see"" strategy?  You can just keep right on dumping into short term bonds over and over again and wait and see.  Probably everyone thought of that and it's driving them up... (??)

People will blames whoever is in office.
   Divide and conqer and they stay poor.
Your right though I was really hoping to see DC get cleaned up, then bang! The pipeline gets shutdown and catastrophe hits, though one pipeline shouldn't be so devastating, it does look like it is though
where do you learn this type of stuff? are there like courses on how to make money on the side or something?? lol
correct
What do you mean by asset ownership?  House? Car?  I’m a millennial and it’s really not that hard if you are in a trade or have a degree that doesn’t suck.
Inverted yields are a reliable sign of recession. This is one hell of an inverted yield, too. This time, it's mostly related to poor results regarding inflation. The USD is seeing around 9% inflation, so long term bonds will actually have negative yields if they can't stop inflation (the value of the dollar will be about a quarter of what it is now in 20 years, at this rate of inflation, the bond's real value is dropping at about 6% per year, 9% inflation - 3% yield.)

There's no safe place for rich people to gamble their wealth, so they will attempt to decrease overhead, which causes recessions, which added to inflation creates the dreaded stagflation - where wages aren't rising to keep pace with inflation. That leads to massive domestic problems and civil unrest if left unchecked. And it won't take long, as close to the bottom as many are after 2020.

Should be a very nasty winter.
People are more uncertain of the next two months, fearing a recession.
Lol Joe Biden has a lot to do with it though, in a economy that was put in an overdrive down spiral from cutting off it's economic salvation by shutting down fossil fuels sows a stock market crash. That's exactly what Joe Biden did. Joe hurts matters as Trump would say ""Badly"".
Thanks! This was nice and informative
>Should be a very nasty winter.

how long does this winter usually last??
arent we already in a recession didnt they try to change the definition of recession?
10 years? But like always, they'll declare victory after the stock market rebounds in 3.
We technically are already in a recession by the old definition, which is 2 quarters of negative gdp. It’s funny, right when the 2nd quarter hit, they changed the definition. Wonder how long they intend to prop up this house of cards"
Real disposable income in the U.S declines sharply,66,https://i.redd.it/9v8und1vzy891.jpg,"Declines sharply from an artificial infusion of cash and stimulus. Normal stuff. In average is still up
So  ""Per capita monthly"" is the total income over the population I presume and what speaks to me about this is the speculation that this is probably driven by the rather modest increase in income for the lower quintiles, and that probably the biggest increase in income for our country's poor since WBush has therefore been response to crises.
Real disposable income returns to pre-stimulus levels.
Damn I’m no fan of Trump but look at that smooth line from 16-20 lol
Is this scaled by cpi, or some other metric to get to ""real""?
Yeah, but as usual, Spiders Georg, who eats 10,000 spiders a day, is an outlier and should not be counted. Per capita data is misleading. Let's look at the median and see how it holds up.
Not when household debt is also up for low and median earners
I think you are not aware of how much money was poured into small businesses. Individuals who had always lived paycheck to paycheck got tons of money in their pockets(by their standard if they were lucky), and businesses got the lions share and many are still applying because emergency standards for relief payments are by their nature loosely regulated. 

That sharp peak is on a scale not seen in our countries history.
Starts in 2013.
You can attribute about 18 months of that (2016-2017) to Obama policies still in play. Trump just “didn’t fuck with it” but he should have because a lot of that “real” income wasn’t real… it was the “ballon” of the overall market, an now it has popped.

They should have begun to inch up the Fed rate in around 2018, slowly and in small increments to avoid what then has happened.
Trump was good for Real Income pre-pandemic…
Probably not. It' s listed as ""Per capita Monthly"" which I believe is a statistic published by the BLS in 'real' numbers.

edit: sorry I skipped over the reference to the Bureau of economic analysis but I expect it's now adjusted CPI as that type of statistic is normally reported in 'real' (actual numerical value) numbers.
No, that's a factor, there's just so many more desperately poor people.
Yuge permanent tax break for the wealthy, moderate expiring tax break for middle class
The tax break most affected the middle and upper middle class. I believe the best brackets were 80-120k and 120k-250k. Above 500 there was a marginal decrease at best. What’s much more upsetting is the divide and transfer of wealth that happened from lockdowns especially with regards to small businesses
Average federal taxes paid decreased across ALL income groups. Yes the wealthiest got some tax breaks, but they also had huge deductions eliminated. 

Comparing before and after-the bottom 20% of earners saw their federal taxes paid fall from 1.2% to 0%. The top percent saw a reduction of 1.5%. A larger percentage decrease, yes, but their share of federal income taxes paid was the highest since Obama took office and third highest at any point in American history. 

https://taxfoundation.org/congressional-budget-office-shows-2017-tax-law-reduced-tax-rates-across-board-2018/


There are several things worth changing on the bill, but it’s no where near as bad as people made it out to be for the lower and middle class. My family is middle income with multiple kids and we paid almost $4k less in taxes comparing before/after.

Hey, I've seen this one before. (Back to Future meme).
If you're smart you invest in bitcoin
Sure hope so
Capitalism lasting requires strong and vigorously enforced antitrust laws. When businesses are allowed to form monopolies and oligopolies, they destroy the competition in the employer-market needed to keep wages high.

 Labor has nowhere to go except other business owned by the same few oligopolies. This results in ever worsening wealth disparity in which labor exists paycheck to paycheck.

When workers can't afford to spend even a small amount each month on stocks, they have no way to meaningfully take part in capitalism except as servants. 

 Capitalism could be a good system with strong and vigorously enforced antitrust laws. Unfortunately, such laws are prime targets for rich corporations to erode.
If you were hired as a consultant to one of these institutions and they asked you how to transition into a sustainable investment model what would you say?
Just need a clear out and regrowth, that's the natural order.
We don't live in a truly capitalistic society.

Microorganims are widespread in nature and are beneficial to life, but some can cause serious harm. They can be divided into six major types: bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoa, algae, and viruses.

The population of the earth is headed up exponentially. We expect to end up in the 10 to 20 billion territory.
> The population of the earth is headed up exponentially.

It used to be that way, but it has levelled off so the growth is ""only"" linear. Of course, with 90% of overshoot in absence of fossil fuels that's a lot of dead people.
It won't happen because it can't happen. And if it will happen the drop from 10 to 1 will be even more catastrophic.
This is not true. The global population is projected to peak at about 11 billion around year 2100. See:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projections_of_population_growth
This is what I've been saying. The population of the earth is probably 2 to 3 times what it should be already. I also laugh and say China and India expect to live like us, but if they achieve that, the planet will die in a few years.
That is still in the 10 to 20 billion territory like I said. I've also heard some predictions that put it much closer to 20 billion.
This… is the scary truth. This planet will not be able to cope with another 3+billion people demanding McDoubles and GreenTea Frappuccino’s with a double shot of Espresso"
"House Democrats introduce plan to pay Americans $2,000 a month",64,https://www.businessinsider.com/americans-would-receive-2000-a-month-under-house-democrats-plan-2020-4,"This needed to be done last month.
Super weird how the democrats are all gung-ho about Bernie's plan as soon as Bernie is out of the race. 

So strange.
At this point they're just arguing over how much the inflation rate is gonna be.
according to billionaire financial wiz Lee Cooperman, main street should be fine with their $1200 checks.
I've seen more and more security guards inside of grocery stores recently.  When asked about it, one of them mentioned they had seen a large spike in shoplifting since the beginning of April.  Take it with a grain of salt, but it does appear that people are getting a bit desperate when the money runs dry.
I don't understand why you would need this. You(USA) are already getting one of the most generous relief program.
If this doesn't pass then we will have more of the toilet paper fights but over food and gas and normal shit that people shouldn't be getting stabbed over.
Let's get back to grade school math. #1 the cesspool government has NO MONEY.   The only way government can issue any monetary payment is to tax the working people and businesses and then redistribute. The only other way is to print money which they are doing which is causing all this inflation.  Socialism has never ever worked in any country and will nor work here. The democrats have taken our country in one year and have destroyed the American dream and our way of life.  Every direction you look in the democrats have fucked it up. Russia has become over 10 times richer since diaper shitting dementia Joey Biden took over, China is getting ready to take Taiwan and we all know that Taiwan makes over 65% of the world's semiconductors which we are already short on, our boarder is screwed with millions of illegals crossing yearly which the American taxpayers will be paying for their rent health care, foodstamps etc. Stock market has lost trillions, all our 401k,s are quickly going down, way down. Crime is through the roof, store shelves are bare. Our FBI, Depth of Justice and congress are full of corruption, its just unbelievable the amount of damage that has been done within a year by the anti American democrats 🙄
A wonderful idea. But given how many are demanding to go back to work before the first coronavirus checks have even begun to be distributed, it's not going to happen any time soon. 

I'd prefer getting behind Medicare For All right now. Many people on coronavirus treatment will have no way to pay for it if they recover.
No shit.  How do they figure they shut down the economy and dish out $1200 to people?  How long has it been down for now?  Those crooks on capital hill are so fuckin out of touch with the common struggle of paying bills.  They get paid too much, they get too many kickbacks, politicians weren't designed to make a damn career out of... all those ""let's vote on our raise this year"" bullshit needs to be reverted.
I seriously cannot stand politicians anymore.  This secret meeting about the virus, selling your stocks... swept under the rug, no one reports on it anymore.

I mean they handed out all this $1200, WTF am i supposed to do with $1200 in northern CA?  Buy a couple trips to the grocery store?  Meanwhile how much are they all making?  Banks are taking people's stimulus checks to cover over draft fee's... how bout we start looking at people at human beings with real life struggles, instead of voters.  This country is getting worse and worse.  I served for this country, love it... but my mind is kinda fantasizing about living elsewhere.  Too crowded, every place is dirty and crime ridden (where i live, not where u live), people are terrible, terrible at driving... it's a place that I'm just tired of.
Sure.  Why not? That won’t exacerbate the inflation problem.  Free money. Fed printer goes brrrr. What could go wrong?
Universal Basic Income was the cornerstone of Andrew Yang’s campaign, not Bernie’s.
what relief programs? are you talking about $1200 new iphone money? what about food though
They don't report on it because the media is corrupt also and in corporations pockets. Everything right now is fucked to Oblivion because of the way the government has become corrupt overtime as well as the media. I honestly don't know how we're going to change this sorry mess we call America.
It wont matter. I'm unemployable and my retirement plan is being homeless.
Bernie specifically proposed $2,000 a month for Americans when the coronavirus crisis hit. 

https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/bernie-sanders-2000-a-month-coronavirus

https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-says-us-must-pay-every-american-household-2000-per-month-until-coronavirus-1492870

https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/488145-sanders-proposes-giving-2000-per-household-during-coronavirus-crisis

So if you're trying to say the DNC isn't copying this from Bernie, they are. They're fine with Bernie's ideas as long as they don't have to admit that Bernie proposed them or give him any credit. 

Also, Andrew Yang didn't come up with the idea for UBI, that happened like 300 years ago.

Also, U.B.I. was not the cornerstone of Yang's campaign, because what Andrew Yang proposed *was not* U.B.I. A lot of people tried to pretend that it was. Including Yang.
It was still the same basic principle of Bernie's campaign.
2.2 trillion iphone dollar money.
Ah, was unaware Bernie made this proposal prior to termination of his campaign, thanks for informing me. And no, of course Yang didn’t invent the concept of UBI, he merely advocated for it to be permanently set in place (not just to aid during the pandemic).
While implementation of a wealth tax for the purpose of redistribution of wealth thru means such as the funding of Medicare for all and free education for all would have a similar net effect, it’s not the same as UBI. As far as I’m aware, Bernie’s campaign at no point advocated for UBI. Meanwhile, Andrew Yang made UBI the cornerstone of his campaign as he recognized that technology would make many American jobs obsolete within the next few years.
Is the virus disrupting the supply out of china? If not, maybe the factories can upgrade the factory safety nets? By raising pay or upgrading the literal nets that catch the jumpers.
Yeah, now that you mention it I guess it was prior to his withdrawal from the race, but you are correct I would not say it was part of his campaign. It's not something he brought up in speeches, or was on his website, it was a direct response to the coronavirus pandemic. 

I think Bernie probably did support the idea of it, or would be likely to, but he tried to keep focus on Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. He was pretty busy most of the time getting crucified in the media for those, probably didn't have enough bandwidth to get raked over the coals for supporting U.B.I. as well.
Nobody is talking about anyone's campaign except you. The word used was ""plan"". 

I never so much as suggested that U.B.I. was part of Bernie's campaign, so I have no idea where you're getting this. Makes no sense.
You’re correct, for whatever reason I was using the words “plan” and “campaign” interchangeably."

####The Seven-Year Auto Loan: America’s ~~Middle Class~~ **Increasing Number of Underclasses** Can’t Afford Its Cars
[deleted]
The paywall is down for today and monday, so you can see charts. Here is the text for when it goes back up (minor note - the article is about a month old)..........

Walk into an auto dealership these days and you might walk out with a seven-year car loan.

That means monthly payments that last well past when the brake pads give out and potentially beyond when the car gets traded in for a new one. About a third of auto loans for new vehicles taken in the first half of 2019 had terms of longer than six years, according to credit-reporting firm Experian PLC. A decade ago, that number was less than 10%.

Car loans that are increasingly stretched out are a pronounced sign that some American middle class buyers can’t afford a middle-class lifestyle.

Incomes have risen at a sluggish pace in the past decade, but car prices have grown rapidly. New technological and safety features, such as larger and more sophisticated multimedia displays, have made even the most basic cars more expensive. U.S. consumers have also veered toward pricier rides such as sport-utility vehicles that tend to dominate auto showrooms. The result is that consumers are seeking bigger loans than ever to purchase a car.

G
A lending machine has revved up in response, making it possible for more Americans to procure a vehicle by spreading the debt over longer periods. Wall Street investors snap up these loans, which are bundled into bonds. Dealers now make more money on the loans their customers take than on the cars they sell.

For many Americans, the availability of loans with longer terms has created an illusion of affordability. It has helped fuel car purchases that would have been out of reach with three-, five- or even six-year loans.

“People can get into very expensive cars,” said Bronson Argyle, a professor at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, whose research focuses on consumer credit. “Households are taking on, on average, more risk.”


Deven Jones, seen here in his Honda Accord.
Deven Jones walked into the Rolling Hills Honda dealership in St. Joseph, Mo., in early 2017 after a salesman emailed him and said he might be able to buy a new car for less than $400 a month.

Mr. Jones, now 22 years old, walked out with a gray Accord sedan with heated leather seats. He also took home a 72-month car loan that cost him and his then-girlfriend more than $500 a month. When they split last year and the monthly payment fell solely to him, it suddenly took up more than a quarter of his take-home pay.


He paid $27,000 for the car, less than the sticker price, but took out a $36,000 loan with an interest rate of 1.9% to cover the purchase price and unpaid debt on two vehicles he bought as a teenager. It was particularly burdensome when combined with his other debt, including credit cards, he said.

Just 18% of U.S. households had enough liquid assets to cover the cost of a new car, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of 2016 data from the Fed’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, a proportion that hasn’t changed much in recent years.

Even a conservative car loan often won’t do it. The median-income U.S. household with a four-year loan, 20% down and a payment under 10% of gross income—a standard budget—could afford a car worth $18,390, excluding taxes, according to an analysis by personal-finance website Bankrate.com.

Stretched-out Debt
Auto loans are increasingly getting stretched out to keep payments manageable.



But the size of the average auto loan has grown by about a third over the past decade to $32,119 for a new car, according to Experian. To keep payments manageable, the car industry has taken to adding more months to the end of the loan.

The average loan stretches for roughly 69 months, a record. Some last much longer. In the first half of the year, 1.5% of auto loans for new vehicles had terms of 85 months or longer, according to Experian. Five years ago, these eight- and nine-year loans were practically nonexistent.

Upside Down
A growing share of buyers won't pay off their debt before trading their car in for a new one.




As a result, a growing share of car buyers won’t pay off the debt before they trade in their cars for new ones, either because the car is in need of repairs or because they want a newer model. A third of new-car buyers who trade in their cars roll debt from old vehicles into their new loans, according to car-shopping site Edmunds. That is up from about a quarter before the financial crisis.

Americans have been borrowing to buy their cars for decades, but auto debt has swelled since the financial crisis. U.S. consumers held a record $1.3 trillion of debt tied to their cars at the end of June, according to the Federal Reserve, up from about $740 billion a decade earlier.

As the global financial system flirted with disaster more than 10 years ago, two of the big three U.S. auto makers received government bailouts and restructured their debt in bankruptcy. The industry emerged into a battered economy when consumers hardly had the cash to go car shopping.

Bond Boom
Wall Street investors have snapped up car loans packaged into bonds, reshaping the automobile market.




Yet for the auto industry, there was a silver lining: Interest rates had fallen to practically zero. Suddenly, it was much cheaper to finance a car. Loans made to buyers were snapped up by Wall Street investors looking for returns as income from supersafe Treasurys drifted toward zero.

The combination of rock-bottom rates and yield-hungry investors helped bring the U.S. auto industry back to life. By 2015, auto sales had reached records.

Low rates, in effect, served as a bailout for the entire auto industry. Last year, investors bought a record $107 billion of bonds backed by cars, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade group. That is the first issuance record since 2005 and nearly triple the amount two decades earlier. The outstanding pile of auto bonds swelled to a record $264 billion.

So far this year, dealerships made an average of $982 per new vehicle on finance and insurance versus $381 on the actual sale, according to J.D. Power, a data and analytics company. A decade earlier, financing brought in $516 per car and the sale made dealers $837.

To see these shifts up close, visit a dealership’s finance office. Dealers call it “the box,” a reference to the holding cell to which Paul Newman’s character was sent in the 1967 movie “Cool Hand Luke.” Since most buyers borrow to pay for their cars, it falls on the finance manager to figure out a manageable payment schedule.

Shifting Gains

Higher vehicle prices and a bigger appetite for SUVs means Americans are spending more money on buying cars.


The dealership commonly holds on to a portion of the interest rate, typically between 1 and 2 percentage points, or gets a one-time payment from the lender. The dealer also pitches high-margin add-on services, such as extended warranties and insurance for dings and dents, which are rolled into the loan.

When potential buyers enter Petrov Degand’s office at Earl Stewart Toyota in North Palm Beach, Fla., he walks them through each add-on, presenting the full menu of options, he said. He has seen finance managers quote a price in which the add-ons are already bundled into the loan amount to increase the bottom line, a tactic known as “packing the payment.”

Jose Mercado agreed to buy a series of add-ons, including an extended warranty, for his new RAV4 midway into his fifth hour at a Toyota dealership this spring. Mr. Mercado, 41, who lives in Blackwood, N.J., and works in a chocolate factory, had spent the previous six months reading reviews and figuring out how much he should pay for the car.



He found himself unprepared for the hard sell from the finance manager. The add-ons brought his payment to $448 a month, nearly $100 more than he had expected to pay when he walked in to buy his first new car in 18 years.

“I wish my research would have been deeper to be more ready,” he said.

Longer loans will be the only way to sustain our debt based economy.  And expect them to get longer.

Bank of Argentina now offering 100 year bonds?

When housing prices get too high we will see 50 year home loans maybe longer.  Just to keep the economy going.

A friend of mine had to visit emergency room / hospital without health insurance.  He got a bill from the hospital for about $25K.  No way can he afford it.  He tells the hospital billing dept. he can afford to pay $10/month for the rest of his life or file bankruptcy and have the debt washed away.  If you were the Hospital what would you take?  Extending payments for eternity will be the new norm.
We should just move to California and all buy electric cars and hybrids. Yeah… they’re not expensive af. 🤬
Bingo

cont..........

Mr. Jones walked out of the Rolling Hills Honda dealership with a 72-month car loan amounting to $36,000.
Finance managers at dealerships typically use an electronic portal to hash out the terms of the loans. On the other end are various financial institutions that buy up the loan pretty much as soon as the dealer closes the deal.

Banks and credit unions are big lenders, as are the finance arms of major car makers. Some of these lenders shunned riskier subprime borrowers after the financial crisis, fueling the growth of independent nonbank auto lenders.

Westlake Services LLC is among the biggest. Its owner, billionaire Don Hankey, started lending four decades ago when, as a dealer, he realized subprime buyers needed somewhere to get their financing. Westlake is still focused on these borrowers, but it has pursued more creditworthy customers as it has grown in recent years.

Much like a dealership, the company is obsessed with results. An automated system sends emails to employees with an image of a winking robot when they are late to work, unproductive or exceed expectations. Workers get monthly bonuses based on how they stack up against their goals. Screens around the office display auto loan applications as they come in.

Westlake needs to make sure the monthly payments on its auto loans keep flowing. Late borrowers can expect calls from the company immediately. Roughly 40% of its employees focus exclusively on collecting.


The loan payment fell solely on Mr. Jones after he and his then-girlfriend broke up a few years after buying the car.
In mid-April, a representative who handles the most-difficult cases called a past-due borrower to iron out payment on a 2018 Toyota RAV4. The borrower had struggled to keep up with a payment of more than $800. The car already had been repossessed from the borrower once.

The Westlake representative switched between English and Spanish. He offered an extension on the March payment, meaning it wouldn’t be due until the end of the loan in 2024. But he collected nearly $600 on a partial payment for April over the phone. Borrowers are less likely to resume payments if they stop altogether.

After hanging up, the representative rang a bell at his desk. “35K,” he called out, referring to the balance of the loan that was no longer considered seriously delinquent. “It took a while but I got ’em.”


Across the industry, delinquencies have trended higher in the past few years, but they haven’t surged like mortgage delinquencies did during the financial crisis. Investors have been largely content to buy lenders’ auto bonds as they search for returns in a low-rate world. Losses are significantly higher when loan terms lengthen, according to S&P Global Ratings.

Mr. Jones, in Missouri, got his loan from Honda’s financing arm, which pools a large portion of its loans into bonds that it sells to investors. A $1.25 billion sale from late 2017 contained more than 7,000 loans tied to 2017 Accords like the one Mr. Jones owns, according to loan-level data.

The investors who hold Mr. Jones’s loan are still getting paid because he has remained current. Mr. Jones took on more overtime shifts at the plastic factory where he works as a machine operator. A raise and a bonus helped get him to stable ground. Still, he will be making payments for years to come.

Mr. Jones said he doesn’t plan to take out another auto loan soon. “Even just signing the paper, not even driving the car off the lot, suddenly I’m underwater,” he said.
Unfortunately neither of those auto makers are available in America. 

We do have plenty of cars available for 20k or under though.
[deleted]
29K, but he takes out 36K for additional money on other vehicles that he also never paid back. To be fair, this man is just stupid with debt. This is where it rides the fine line between predatory lending practices, and people just being bad with their money. People signing a 9 year loan for a vehicle is just insane. 

That line about “5 hours in the dealership” is the reason I’d never buy from a dealership. I was turned off by the whole process and walked out. I paid for my used vehicle with cash and drove off the lot after 2 test drives and about 15 minutes of paperwork.
Here's a thought don't buy $30,000 to$40,000 trucks and SUVs.
I've had used cars that cheap before, needed more repairs than it's worth in less than 3 months. Never again
Learn a bit about cars to know which makes/models to avoid and to go for and what specific things to check for to make sure the cars are still in good working order. It requires gaining some technical knowledge, but that investment of your time can easily be worth thousands upon thousands of dollars in savings."
50% Chance U.S. Recession Occurs on or Before Dec. 2024 & 90% Chance on or Before May 2024,63,https://i.redd.it/ff0w7aku4oda1.jpg,"[deleted]
Is there writing that explain what I am looking at? How often has there been inversion in the last 15 years, and how many recessions have resulted?
Does title mean Dec 2023?
Not into seeing what a chart claims. All I have to do is see my finances to know more money is going out than coming in.

When that happens. I Know its a recession and no excessive debts either, such as credit card, car payments, etc.

Just basics, rent, food, auto insurance and utilities is taking me out. This sh*t is the real deal!
Does nobody else think it’s weird that this is the most broadcasted recession ever?
They could just reduce rates to counteract this right? Collapse of the yield curve will start august 2023. There’s more risk of depression in the median cpi except for groceries.  An abrupt stoppage to demand will caused chaos for a while.
If you go by the 3month>10year bond crossover trend ( crossover was Oct 22 2022), the recession should bottom out between April 2023 and April 2024
The earlier the better, so we can go back to normal
Spoiler alert: we’re already in a “recession”.
I lived through the 80’s. It’s that, all over again.
Good
They’ve done studies…60% of the time, it works every time
what is the source for this?
We're in an isolated situation due to a Pandemic. Using outdated instruments from previous recessions (unemployment, negative GDP, mortgage defaults) are simply a falsehood. Why can't anyone take numbers from Q4 2019 and create a restore point there? Apparently, that's _impossible._
They’ve been trying to kill the economy since before the midterms.
The sum of x alone or y alone cannot be greater than the sum of x+y, if x and y are both nonnegative numbers.  See me after class.
This is not how probabilities work, especially for the normal distribution. It doesn't work on a time basis. You would need to use a geometric or exponential distribution to understand the probability over time. This is something made by someone who maybe took half an introductory statistics course.
Where can I find this chart online?
Omg I can’t believe people are still buying into this crap. Journalists and Wall Street have been using that headline for the past 3 years now. Save this comment all the way until 2025 - I’ll still be right, and there will still be no recession.
This yield curve inversion is not like the others. Even the guy who invested the metric says that he does think it’s a good indicator this time around.
The recession has already begun.  I work in a chemical plant and 75% of my plant is idle with no orders.  There’s no overtime, no capital spending, all maintenance is done by need.  If maintenance on a broken piece of equipment is not needed, it’s not being done.  It’s as bad, if not worse than in 2009.
when we get rations 

then, and only then, will they call it a depression
With unemployment under 4%?
After 3 years of sharply negative growth. Growth is still slightly positive.

If you think we are anywhere near a depression, you must not remember 2008-2009.

There are certainly systemic risks, and nobody can predict black swans, but the recession we are facing still looks like it will be *far* less severe than the financial crisis.
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y#

Economic data for yield curve inversion preceeds (i believe) all recessions.  
The way i understand it is the long term investment risk is safer than short term risk.
Which is usually the opposite (short term or immediate future should be looked at as a pretty safe bet as compared to a much longer ""unforseen"" future of uncertainty.)

Last one was in August 2019, the time before was December 2005. Some could last for months as in 2019 and some years as in 2005/2006 but essentially the writing is on the wall that trends are shifting (tighter monetary policy,  loss of jobs,  unaffordability, consecutive - in GDP, etc..).

Once something like a loss of jobs or a highly leveraged large investment ""breaks"" or goes bankrupt it causes an economic domino affect.  People lose money/jobs and financial constriction happens very broadly and the cycle continues.  
**The first dominoes may have already fallen when you think about the Evergrande situation in China,  Credit Suisse in Switzerland,  or FTX in North America.**

Don't let single data points like great job numbers mislead you to the inevitable.
I think so, yeah.
No. It’s the single most important number in the whole title. Denoting the year. They would have to have fucked it up twice. It must be 2024.
The issue stems from the fact that “this economy sucks for individuals quite clearly” is not only described by the words “recession” or “depression”.

Everyone suffering wants to stamp “recession” on the economy, but does it really matter?  Everyone knows there is inflation.  Everyone knows the housing market changed.  Everyone knows food is pricey and tons of people are struggling with rent.

This could all happen without a general decline in economic activity.  The label is beside the point.
I think it's weird that we are literally in a recession and yet fucking everyone and their mother keep asking ""wEn ReCeSsIoN???""
It's only because the internet exists. I guess it could complicate things, but it just makes the esoteric financial data of the past more accessible. It doesn't make it less valid imo.

Most people don't think we're going into a recession, nor are they paying attention.
Recessions are normal, asset bubbles created by constant lowering of interest rates and unlimited government intervention are not normal.
Can I ask where you personally see the parallels?
[deleted]
Given it happens to be a flawless normal distribution... I would say somebody's ass.
Also normal distributions can't predict probability over time, just whether something will happen or not. It would have to be an exponential or geometric distribution.
Right? Unemployment is still 3.5%. Literally has not changed since March 2022.
Because they keep changing how unemployment is calculated. Last time they removed people of retirement age and any college students (of any age) as if they don’t need jobs as well. 

Always look at the changes in calculation.  I think in the most recent they added length of unemployment. So if you been unemployed for less than 60 days it’s not counted etc. 

Finally if you have two jobs and you lose on me it doesn’t hurt the number but it does benefit it when you have two. 

They mess with the numbers to make them
Optimal. Always look at how it’s calculated for anything the government releases. 

That is what I recall from the few times but do your own research and you’ll see
I don’t even pay attention to this anymore

It doesn’t include those that are under-employed, or the fact that being employed has nothing to do with that wage being livable, or the people being able to not collect debt, have kids, or save for retirement

It’s put out there as opium for the masses
Yes, but all inversions don’t lead to recession. Since that is true, there are other factors besides inverted yield curves that produce recessions. Because if it was inversions alone, there would be a perfect correlation. Since there isn't, there has to be other factors. 

The first place to look is into what causes an inverted yield curve. If there are multiple ways to reach an inverted status, perhaps some of those possibilities are recession signals and others aren’t.
Is that sarcasm? Bc then the math doesn't make sense. May 2024 seems right
Wasn’t GDP up? I think we find out at the end of this week what GDP is doing.
Holy crap! Upvoted!
I think this is the reason why

https://reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/10iojdc/_/j6vplv5/?context=1
Yeah, what’s the old joke: “the bond market has predicted 9 of the last 5 recessions.”
not according the this research paper I linked below. It says that if the yield curve on average is ever inverted for longer than 1 quarter it has a 100% batting average of predicting recessions over the last 50 years


https://www.researchaffiliates.com/content/dam/ra/publications/pdf/965-history-lessons-how-transitory-is-inflation.pdf
Not sarcasm. They do mean 2024. December 2025. Which is basically two years out. Which is why the prediction is largely useless. A 50% chance of something over the next two years. That’s just such a long time frame that 1 million things could change. We could literally have a new president by then. The entire stock market could fall and rise and fall again in that time. AI software could be writing half of the posts on Reddit by then.
Massive inflation, massive rate hikes that have so far been ineffective, every stock sector crashing down after a 10 year bull run, housing prices crashing, the list goes on. We are in a fucking recession, fuck the GDP.
Do you have a link? My understanding is they contact about 60,000 households and survey them. Anyone working or looking for work is counted. As far as I know, this method hasn't changed in a long time.
No it literally doesn't make sense. How can it be 90% sooner but 50% later? That's not how math works.
You can look at chart actually dates are on there
Relax
Yet still housing unaffordable
https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-is-the-real-unemployment-rate-3306198

That covers some points. Looking for the student and older generation being excluded one. 

Notice on the link how they treat part time workers as employed etc. 

Then this link you’ll read about some of the fuckery:

https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf

The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 3.9 million, changed little in December. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)

-	These people above should count as unemployed for example. 

The number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job fell by 352,000 to 5.2 million in December and is little different from its February 2020 level of 5.1 million. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)


-	notice the verbiage on this paragraph. 



Again lots going on here to fuck with the numbers. Need to find the one where they don’t count students or people of retirement age.

I mean it makes a decent bit of sense if you look at the chart and see that it predicts 50% chance by December 2023 and 90% chance by may 2024 and then just deduce that he miss typed in the title and meant December 2023 not 2024"

Nobody knows, it's pretty clear though that we're going to have some kind of monetary crisis sometime soon. 

But honestly, if I had to guess I think we're going to be topping out for the next 6-12 more months. The government is spending so much and the interest rates are still so low that it is incredibly difficult for the economy to stay down for long. 

I don't see a violent recession like 2008 happening, rather I think we'll just slide into one. Consumer purchases will dry up, businesses will go under more, and deflationary forces will take over for a couple of years. We'll have a good old-fashioned recession for a bit, and the government will do everything they can to get out of it, mainly low rates, FED continuing asset purchases, and heavy, heavy spending. All of this will eventually lead to the next crisis which will be hyperinflation (this is all from the USA perspective btw).

This whole thing will take a decade to play out though, take a look at how many years the Weimar Republic's inflationary collapse took, it's always longer than people predict.
Actually, theres only 4 days left as evergrande will miss a payment on Monday and collapse, turning the world into Lebanon

What makes you say that?🤔🤔
Give or take 2-3 months, spot on.
Anyone here apply for an EIDL loan from SBA? I applied back in July 2021 and was originally approved for a $100K loan for my small business. I waited 2 months as they processed my application, then suddenly on September 2nd, they asked me if I wanted a loan increase to $500K...!?! That's $500,000 aka 1/2 million dollars. I agreed and was instantly approved in less than 24 hours pending signing paperwork.

Now here's where it gets interesting...on the surface, the loan terms are 12-18 month payment grace period, then monthly payments of $2,500 for the next 30 years at 3.5%. Sounds good, right?

But then when you go through all the ways you can't use the EIDL money, you start to see what the government is really trying to do. In short, you can ONLY use the money for monthly operating expenses...not improvements to the business, no investment in a new company car, no paying off business credit cards, no repairs to the car or office, no using the money for revamping the company website, no using the money whatsoever for trying to grow the business, etc. And if you violate those vague terms, the government has the right to fine you 1.5 times the amount of the loan and seize any of your assets. And if the government wants to audit you, you have to hire an accountant and pay for the audit. You are not even allowed to move your business to another location if you take the loan. Crazy!

It's basically worse than any predatory loan. And it feels like the government is getting their grips around Small Businesses now, getting ready to seize assets and invent new ways to tax them, in anticipation of a major market crash coming.

As much as I could use the money to better re-allocate my finances, in the end, I decided not to the take the loan as the terms were way to scary predatory. And heck, what good is 1/2 million dollars if I can't use it on anything that would violate its terms. The terms are so vague the government could make up anything off the top of their head and find you in violation of loan terms. And even if you are in the right, you will have to spend a fortune in money, time, and aggravation to fight the givernment. It feels like the huge amount of money the SBA is willing to loan you, $500k, is just getting you to take the bait.

The EIDL loan program expires this December 2021, and I think the market will crash sometime thereafter. And mark my words, you will start to hear about a wave of Small Businesses getting fleeced by Uncle Sam for an SBA loan they took out of desperation, which they wish they never agreed to in the first place.

The 1971 monetary system is inherently flawed due to being a debt based structure which overwhelms even the ability of the wealthy to keep up with the usury.  


What happened in the last 50 years is a change over from a masculine-assertive-creative economy into a effeminate-passive-rentier system.

What is going to happen during the next intervention is the federal government via the federal reserve will intervene with direct equity and bond purchases as is the case in Japan and Europe.

Without a structural change in the monetary system, that is going from a private debt based to a regulated credit based system based on development the entire economy will have to be nationalized.

The financial system is the result of the libertarian madness of Milton Friedman and paradoxically ends up in a total nationalization of the economy as its end game. Just like all nutcase libertarian experiments.

As for time wise. The 71 fiat money system collapses with the death of the baby boomers who were its main lifeline. Boomers were about 20-30 years old when the fiat system came on and now its crumbling with them being near death.
Stop fear mongering, all that’s gonna happen is they’ll raise the debt ceiling again, the housing market crash won’t really be a crash because payment plans have to be offered until the court eviction process can even be completed.

All anyone needs to do if the pessimists are correct is to invest the exact opposite as how people invest today .,you can turn your computer screen upside down if you choose . 
Invest in a broad array of hedges and I’d include dividends and invest in non leveraged bearish biased ETFs.  Commodities would be a sector to include since its kind of an anti US dollar play and it’s an inflation play along with a supply shortage play . 
Look at wheat or Weat or nat gas or oil stocks and the dividends . Silver and gold stocks and a bit of crypto mixed in  real estate has its place as well which could also be used as rental income along with living in the house . All I’m getting at is even if we see a deflationary spiral and complete economic collapse there will be strategies that will help a person get through it that isn’t all that painful compared to those who do nothing or just sit in cash . 
There was a time when cash ruled but I don’t think now is that time . Eventually we come to a conclusion that we need food to live and we need shelter . 
Being in control of the place you live in has its advantages but if you choose to rent nothing wrong with that . 
I’d much rather see a deflationary depression then a hyper inflationary scenario . 
Prepare for both and be flexible . 
Regardless of what we all think . It will take longer than we imagine and as we go through all the twists and turns we realize that it will not play out exactly as we anticipated . 
An inflationary depression would suck ! 
Think of every possible scenario you can come up with that could play out in the next 10 years and invest in each theme . 
Robots to crypto to deflation to inflation to technology or healthcare or war ! Steel and basic metals 
Then since you’re watching all these different themes you will see when they turn up or down and you will be on top of it no matter what happens .
Include 
Rare Earth Minerals ! 
Everyone may differ on what an economic collapse is .
I’m not here to argue I’m just posting my thoughts in an attempt to create thought.
I wish everyone success regardless of the economy .
Could be. The Grand Supercycle (3rd wave started in the 1780s) is going into the 4th Elliott Wave which will mean a greater depression than 1932.
I started typing a long answer but can’t do it all justice explain in a comment like this, and I’ll drive myself insane trying to do it.

HERE’S MY SUMMARY….

There is a new world order aka one world government that is being formed, and WILL happen.

They must completely wipe out the US dollar for this new government to rule the entire world.

Study the USD and how it grew to be the world’s dominant fiat currency and WHY/HOW it’s still there (Nixon & Gold standard, Saudi Arabia, Oil, etc)

IMO the time table is basically up.

There’s nothing really left the elite of the world (who DO exist, don’t even think for a second that dementia joe and Kamala have any say in anything) have to put into place to set this thing off.

I have water, supplies, canned food, etc all stocked up and ready for whatever.

If you think the 9/11 inside job was bad, that’s nothing for what they could be planning in order to sink the US.

Best thing we can do is get saved under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, read our Bible and obey it, stay off the news, prep our families for the worst case scenario, and live one day at a time.

If you think I’m crazy, that’s fine I do too.

Really hope I am wrong and it doesn’t get bad. But recently had to admit to myself the reality of what’s coming, cause it ain’t a joke.

Whether it’s tomorrow, next month, 6 months, 4 years, or 8 years, it IS gonna be the worst time period in the history of humanity.

The 2008 “recession” is not remotely comparable to what’s coming.

Maranatha.
Uhm, no?
I thought so to, but the governments in EU and US have decided to take the money printing trap. 

What is likely to happen is a reverse inflation we were seeing, assets are likely to deflate however commodities might stay the same or even increase. 

Combining ir with green strategies, both natural gas and oil prices might increase also.

So either the governments decide to let the economy go QE way or go back to the old ways to let the economy heal itself. 

Chinese real estate crash will effect China mostly, so for us Europeans or Americans it's actually a good thing. Weaker China is good.
Inflation is real right now. Don’t believe main stream media. The 2008 crash started in November & didn’t get to mainstream media until January- yep, that’s right- AFTER Christmas shopping. The trick this time now is that people can see the product shortages on the shelf. And the media will blame the pandemic which is a crock of shite. Something else is always going on that the average person is not aware of.
That is the issue with known unknowns

timing is guess work in the best of times

Prepping for it however is prudent
Its already happening.  Starting off slow but picking up pace now.
Been saying that for two years. Will the 2%ers ever be done with their stock market money grab? Probably not. Let’s keep ripping off future working classes to stuff the wealthiest’s pockets today. /s
What happened to the Everglades?
I would say it’s the perfect spark for a war, which is good for the economy and morale of unity and national unity + there’s the bonus of eating general chaos chicken literally from Chao in his house like any good cantaloupe eating cannibal would do. 😀
Seems like the Fed is already doing everything it can to prop up the economy. Are we going to do 200bil$ in QE a month? Fed going to become buyer of last resort for stocks?
Venus by Tuesday?
Let's see your puts. Put your money where your mouth is and show us your portfolio. 

After all, it'll all collapse in 4 days and you'll be a multi-millionaire with those impressive predictive powers.
Hmmm🤔
Still waiting for the collapse...*.yawns*
>Then based on history, statistics show that when a world power (USA,) is challenged by a growing world power (China,) that war is a result more than 50% of the time.

If only China was actually a republic with democratic rights, instead of a tyrannically party run oligopoly, it could be more of a first world , trustworthy ally or friend like the EU and the UK. Much of its ccp actions has been about maintaining the party control and wealth, and staving off dissent or possible revolution by its vast population.
Easy fix this with war extra liquidity is the appetizer to the main course of war bonds 😊

Under the present monetary system which is based on USURIOUS debts growing faster than the economy, the 'end game' is a total nationalization of the entire economy to prevent collapse.

The only way out is to write down the debts and implement a credit based money system that is geared towards innovative development.

No mainstream economists in the world understand the present problem because they are all trained under monetarist assumptions, ie either artificial scarcity via gold standard or artificial scarcity via private bank debts. They simply \*do not\* understand what an economy is.
I'll die on Monday so I don't have ours, just the hope of a quick and painless death
You could say the exact same thing about the US now and when we rose as a global power. It's generally the nature of any powerful nation that you have a small class of ultra-wealthy people exerting their money and power to control the population and further establish and protect their own interests.
Haha...I take it he's an asshole. Well, he's in for a rude awakening as with such a lax approval process, I wouldn't be surprised if he does get audited, because that's another stipulation in the loan agreement. If they feel as though you didn't need the loan to begin with, then they can immediately yank the funds from your bank account and fine you 1.5 times the loan amount. I too already know so many people who got funds thinking they outsmarted Uncle Sam. The government has up to 30 years to find wrong doing at any time, even if you've already paid back the loan. it's the craziest loan terms I've ever read in my life!
But the Everglades house a lot of gators. How do they even manage to have laverage or even acquire credits. They can’t even speak

PLUS! they snap at you. Dangerous
Either way I mean we could shift the Florida man crazies over to China as the first covert wave throw em off our landing beach head
>The only way out is to write down the debts and implement a credit based money system that is geared towards innovative development.

...and then get killed by the international banking and finance class (see: Lincoln, McKinley, Hitler, Kennedy, Gaddafi et al.).
The United States would get smoked in a heartbeat in any open conflict with China.  What kind of drugs are you smoking?  I want some.

Hell, the US military would get smoked by Iran and their ancient military tech (google millenium challenge).  Let alone China (which also means russia). 

The US ruling class are psychopaths, but they arent stupid.
First of all millennium challenge is a joke. Second of all the reason a war with China is a costly is occupation same with Iran. The USA has no problem destroying Iran’s conventional forces it’s the gruelling guerrilla war that would take place after that would be unbeatable unless colonialism makes a come back and troops are permanently placed. China isn’t Iran yes but they aren’t some unbeatable monster and the USA still is the strongest by far military in the world. I think people underestimate what a full out effort by America would look like.
well frankly i have not followed that thought vector in terms of whom would prevail, as its irrelevant for the time being. 

the next set of possibilities is large civil unrest and clamp down of the CCCP on its people even more sparking civil unrest or straight war with a neighboring nation. 

another possibility would be quantitative easing, and the us govt & western govts in turn buy the chinese debt. a sort of M.A.D. strategy through financial engineering; this would be the best case scenario.   
However the 'save face' mentality of chinese culture could throw the soy sauce out with the noodles out with the pengoloin , saying fuck it lets do a buzz aldrin and just go to infinity and beyond and see what happens (dont think they would have that happen, but fringe factions within the CCCP could push for this to occur, to be clear to blow up the financial engineering deal).
Toe for toe the US and it's Allies could quickly cripple PLAN and the PLA.  It would not be in the US's interest to occupy the mainland of China, but it most certainly could keep China form dominating the South China Sea.
> Second of all the reason a war with China is a costly is occupation same with Iran.

You misspelled invasion.
> USA still is the strongest by far military in the world.

Until vietnamese rice farmers or islamic rednecks show up.  Lol.  Get real.  Warfare has evolved beyond what you are fantasizing about.  Ignoring MAD, the chinese hypersonic missiles make US aircraft carriers entirely obsolete. 

Iran would rain down fire upon the emirates water amd electrical supply and cause a 50 million strong mass evacuation.  Then stuxnet.  Then look at the geography of iran, lol.  

US imperialism is getting smoked all over the world and its glorious to behold.  They cant even force project in latin america effectively.
> the next set of possibilities is large civil unrest and clamp down of the CCCP on its people even more sparking civil unrest or straight war with a neighboring nation.

Im living in China, they actually did a great job dealing with the virus.  The party has never been as popular as it is right now since the mao era after the revolution.
Bruh lmao 
Ok so during the occupation of both Vietnam and Afghanistan did the Americans lose after they left or during? 

Your literally basing your information off memes and random news articles like wtf are you going on about your taking worse case situation for the USA in military action and giving literally the best result to the enemy and then tell me to live in reality like wtf lmao 

It’s clear you have no idea what your talking about and believe anything you read that’s “anti imperialism” and eat that shit right up because that’s your agenda

If america wanted they could of stayed in Vietnam and Afghanistan forever and nobody besides the American people could change that
once the 'cult of personality' has been established it keeps people docile for a bit, but the minute it hits wallets that's when problems will rise. As the only solution is quantitative easing policies resulting in the 'bad side of western capitalism' so you need the CCCP rhetoric but the concern there is what if just a small group of people are like...

how much is the west really dictating the misery of my life and communities life in my town...seems to me this could be more in relation to the local govt which is a puppet to the central govt. 

i mean the black swan omen landing was a nice omen that can accelerate FUD.
Living in China?  How are you posting on reddit?

Bruh lmao Ok so during the occupation of both Vietnam and Afghanistan did the Americans lose after they left or during

They lost the entire time.  This time they lost a couple trillion dollars and an immeasurable amount of soft power.  They lost as soon as they began.  

The US spent 20 years and a couple trillion bombing away their global goodwill.  China has been building high speed rail and an alternative to the western economic order.  

Who did the last 20-30 years better?  

The united states cant protect taiwan, let alone invade the mainland.  This is an objective fact, anything else is sheer lunacy.  

I was a us army mechanized infantryman, im no military expert, but i can assure you that  our capabilities are not what you think.
USA 🇺🇸 = best
> i mean the black swan omen landing was a nice omen that can accelerate FUD.

Thats not even a bad omen in chinese culture, let alone a rational thing to point out
Ok the capabilities are not what I think. USA has had the biggest budget since ww2. USA the country with most conflict experience since ww2. USA the richest country in the world since ww2. Never lost or was forced out of an occupation until the American public demands it correct? 

Every occupation is a net lose what’s your point you give a trillion every 20 years away in just international aid alone. Did America not just print out more money in the last 2 years then it’s first 200? Money is just a number even lives lost is so astronomical small compared other conflicts. The karabak war had more people killed in combat in those months then all of us service members in the last 20 years. The last 20 - 30 years has only seen American live improve on every scale lmao 

Taiwan is a logistical nightmare it is not easy to even cross the water and will require thousands of boats and air support and that’s just to get to the island. The shortest distance from mainland China to the island is like 80 miles or something compared to English Channel that’s like 20 lmao 

Nobody thinks occupations of China besides mass genocide Japan style is possible but your overselling China so horribly and it’s seems like you just read military news reports and memes that are aimed at creating fear so they can justify those big budgets and think the red scare is really that potent. We’re talking about China being stuck in mainland and economically sieged nobody here’s even considering an American occupation and should be clear sign to u who really is dominate
See the funny thing is rational, logical though vectors are usually out the window during times of crisis when dealing with groups of people.

China is calling in loans to dozens of countries,59,https://fortune.com/2023/05/18/china-belt-road-loans-pakistan-sri-lanka-africa-collapse-economic-instability/,"The dollar as the reserve currency is drying up, meanwhile countries are going broke. The IMF wants China to forgive some loans, but China says no other countries (like US) is forgiving loans and points the finger back at us for causing inflation. China learned ~~colonialism~~ imperialism through lending from the US, look at places like Puerto Rico, who pays more of its GDP to Wall St hedge funds than paying for it's peoples needs.

Edit, typo
Poor cou tries alreqdy in debt to the us are not going to be able to pay without creating a helluva ton of inflation.
This article is, basically, Western cope that China is first in line for loan payments. How dare they pay out China first?

For example, since it's mentioned in the article, China holds just 10% of Sri Lankan debt. Something like 80% is owned by private and western creditors, but China is the bad guy who should forfeit everything.

Furthermore, China was the only one forgiving massive loans across Africa during pandemic. How much did the Western creditors forgive? Nothing whatsoever. However, Fortune genius article concludes China is a ""brutal and unforgiving"" creditor.

Talking about ""brutal creditors"", I don't see how anyone could possibly take that title from the IMF. Literally murdering children with their mandatory austerity policies which come as ""strings attached"" to their credit.

So all they are whining here about, is that China is getting paid before they are, and that China should forfeit their credits so THEY could get paid instead. I mean, just how obnoxiously self-entitled can the West get? The West is behaving literally like a ""Global Karen"" now...amazing.
The irony is, how everyone is talking about what we've done to the world. What have we done to ourselves?
It's funny that a post about China's predatory financial practices has 20x the amount of ppl bitching about American practices in the comments than anything relating to the Chinese authoritarian state.
I just saw John Oliver talk about that. It's really crazy that us government would allow that to happen
Do you even understand what colonialism is? You probably mean imperialism, but China isn’t doing anything even similar to the US. There are many reasons for it, from being a victim of Western imperialism themselves, to simply lacking the financial instruments the US have at their disposal due to their declining but still existing global financial hegemony.
I love how no matter what shitty practices other countries engage in (like China's predatory financial debting) redditors always bring it back to it somehow being America's fault or diverting to bitch about something America is doing instead.
What a credulous take.
They didn’t allow it to happen they literally orchestrated the whole thing lol the US government is essentially just an enforcer for Wall Street “elites” at this point. I’m sure it’s the same anywhere honestly. 

Crazy how many US congressmen become filthy rich throughout their tenures. Bribes and insider trading are rampant. Don’t even try to hide it anymore.

Once they’ve secured their generational wealth for themselves they start setting up the nepotism so their friends and family can can continue the same toxic cycles for generations to come. 

Weird how the same families and social circles are always involved in EVERYTHING. Regardless of political affiliation which is all make believe anyway. 

(Don’t even get me started on useless American voters who think it’s wise to elect already wealthy  scumbags to be our government representatives. As if they will have our bests interests at heart) 

Once they’ve properly fucked over Americans it’s time to promote these people to UN, WHO, WTO,  ICJ etc so they can do the same thing on a global scale.

And dont worry the “free and independent”  press / media and will handle PR backlash by completely ignoring it altogether. Propaganda and censorship is also on the menu if needed.

Our benevolent public servant puppet masters. 

Sorry for ranting at you. Not intending to attack you in particular. I’m just so disgusted by this bullshit.
Thanks, yes I meant imperialism, they aren't colonizing and you are correct they don't have the means that the US does, but they are absolutely taking any and all resources they can from anywhere they can however they can get it
Lol harassment. You get upset on the internet from a mean comment 😢 poor bb
Well said.
I thought of this quote while reading your comment.

""When plunder becomes a way of life, men create for themselves a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it.""

Frederic Bastiat
But China is doing a version of “modern colonialism”. In many of the countries that they lend money to (which have no way of paying off those loans), China stipulates that Chinese companies and workers will do much of the work paid for by the loan. Basically a mafia-style arrangement.
It's a stupid, uncritical take. You'll believe anything.
You dont even have to believe me wise guy. You can just go through the comments yourself but i guess you're too slow or lazy to figure that one out.

Also, thought it was funny you pulled the thesaurus for your original reply, but now I know you did because you don't even know what the word critical means.
Good for you being a credulous ultranationalist I guess.
I'm an ultranationalist for pointing out the ridiculousness of redditors shifting attention and/or blame towards America on a post about China's predatory lending practices? Good for you for lacking in any ability to make critical analysis and basic reading comprehension I guess? You know you have to actually have some basis in the accusation when using loaded vocabulary towards someone as well as at least having a vague understanding of what the words you're saying mean, right?

Turkey’s Erdogan Blames Lira Slump on Attacks by ‘Money Barons’,61,https://i.redd.it/ilrqn6z5te281.jpg,"What is a money baron?
It’s true.

Speculating banks short sell the currency then put massive pressure on weak western trained passive central bankers into raising rates. Raising rates weakens the currency even more exacerbating the problem.
In a free float fiat money system, commerical banks are allowed to create currency ad infinitum as a form of debt against purely subjective values. Money barrons is the commercial banking cartel which is defacto bankrupt and using state aid globally to survive.

In FX this means you can short sell liras by creating them when you post collateral to do so. Considering that all central bankers are trained in anglo economics you can put pressure on them to raise rates, which further collapses the currency, giving windfall profits to speculators.

turkish lira has had double digit rates for the entire time it has been collapsing.

I mean, it will eventually. I just don't know if the eventually will take 15 or 150 years. We always forget things go on after we die. I mean, we can't be in crisis forever, right guys (guys?).

As I understand it we never actually recovered from 1929, and just have been throwing the water out of the boat instead of closing the hole, so I am not sure if we're in for a ride into the greatest depression ever, since this bubble will have to pop eventually.

I'm just not sure if it will pop for good this time or if we can do some shenanigans to hold it off for another 50-100 years.

2008 was merely a reflex of policies made after 1929, for example. Maybe we'll hold it off again? Idk
Not really. Mitch is basicallt just as bad as Pelosi, both of them just partisan dickwads that everyone in their party bows to. Both of them are paid off entirely by corporations and are more corrupt than we can comprehend.

Biden is just as bad as Trump. He is a fucking moron, but in a professional Obama way, not an unpracticed Trump way. He is just as corrupt as Trump, paid off by global actors and international companies that he bends over for. His son’s laptop have shown literally incontrovertible evidence that Biden is a fucking deceptive shill of a human being (ooooh I know evil fox news reported on this so it must be a lie). Shut the fuck up. Both sides of media is a fog of truth and lies, but the evidence is overwhelming. He is a nepotist like Trump, a corrupt capitalist like Trump, an old loser who doesn’t give two shits about his people, like Trump, and virtue signals to the left with practiced crocodile tears to keep their support just like Trump virtue signals the right with practiced christian words.

If you actually think the neolib left is better than the maga hat right, you’re kidding yourself. Biden/Kamala might as well be another 4 years of Trump and we’d fare no better or worse. The only hope we have is if our entire government got replaced with random low income fools from nowhere - at least they truly understand the situation more than these corrupt rich fucks.

Eh but what do I know. I pretty much just jack off all the fucking time with CNN on one screen and Fox on the other. I like to imagine Anderson Cooper seducing Tucker Carlson, as I think that would make for a very sexy gay porn video. I don’t know what heals divisions more than making love, and the idea turns me on so fucking much. I really wish it would happen.
Well said.
Within a decade, expect cryptocurrencies to allow everybody to become sovereign citizens of planet Earth. We will sidestep governments and currencies. We CAN refuse to participate in this ridiculous Monopoly money charade. Mobility will be the key to making this happen. 

We will see a parallel to what Napster did to the music industry.
Someone that has critical thought. God bless you. I try to tell the people the same thing. Both parties is a show. It always was. A honest person can not make it in politics. It's the sociopath that gets the job. They are just a face. This country is a oligarchy. Look every fucking politician leaves filthy rich. They go in politics and become millionaires. They don't give a fuck about you your family if u can eat or anything like that. They don't fucking care. So if u have nails scratch your own back. Last I checked democrats are filthy rich. Even communist leaders and party members had all the money. Usa better wake up. Think about president after president tells you what you want to hear and once they get the job is a big fuck you. America has a bunch of fucking idiots bashing each other for people in politics that can care less for you. And if u guys are waiting for a handout I guess u going to be waiting for your whole life. Stop being a victim. Don't be a victim. This world is rough and I feel sorry for those snowflakes because as they say get woke go broke. As the saying goes be carful what u wish for. We might get a socialist communism government. And guess what the people that was rich in are current system is going to be rich in a communism system.
Can you explain this further? I don't fully understand, but I am quite intrigued.
I don’t see that happening. Almost all crypto’s are looking to whore themselves out now aka fit into existing infrastructure. I think it’s much more likely Central Banks get rid of cash and we use Central Bank controlled crypto.
Bernie Sanders a socialist millionaire. That should make u think a little bit.
This. Governments, especially powerful ones like the US, aren’t going to give up their control of the money supply and money flows to private corporations. Look at the frenzied reactions when Facebook tried to launch their Libra digital currency. The US dollar is the first and foremost weapon of US imperialism. If crypto replaces our current monetary system it will be controlled and administered by central banks.
all the government has to do is require taxes be paid in dollars then people have to sell crypto for dollars every year. 

the government can't stop crypto at this point but it doesn't matter because the state can go after real assets and income streams of any evaders .

the 2 systems can operate in parallel and crypto just gives people a way to dodge some inflation by taking on the volatility risk of holding crypto. Most people would psychologically rather live with the inflation than take the volatility.
What if governments outright ban crypto and force merchants and banks to not accept it?"
"Government's Own Jobs Report puts Jobless Rate Above 30% in July While US Actually Lost About 100,000 Jobs Not Gained 900,000",59,https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/p2h63a/governments_own_jobs_report_puts_jobless_rate/,"Unemployment rates are meaningless in the modern context.  They are about as fleeced as a stat measure can be and still manages to get it wrong.

I think labour engagement is far more important.
What I find infinitely frustrating as well as baffling, is that the government KNOWS that the way they calculate the unemployment numbers, as well as the inflation rate, is complete nonsense.  And yet, they seem to believe their own bullshit.
Great post. Love the detail. A tldr would help though to just sum up the conclusions.
Thanks. That is a great post.
It's great that you're looking into the numbers, but I don't really get the point of your post. 
  
ONLY looking at the statistic that you express as being more valid, we see that [the employment/population ration has NEVER been above 64% and the pre-pandemic high is 61%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=G2q8). 
  
So, unless you have some secret for how to get the 30% of the population that never works to work. . .
So are all inflation measures. The thing is, our situation has been dire for years; we are Wiley Coyote over the cliff, just waiting to look down.
It’s not for them, it’s to keep the public calm. They know it’s bullshit.
I disagree with you there on Inflation, at least, in a sense I do. The concept of inflation as measuring the purchasing power of a currency is itself what is inherently difficult to measure. The asset classes which are seen to be inflating are conspiratorially protected (e.g. housing prices, insurance costs, automobile price-gouging, education costs) and would be better served by a series of anti-monopoly and/or RICO cases, than an intellectual investigation into the red-herring of currency dynamics. You cannot seriously look at the natural tendency of privatized industries to practice price-gouging and market capture and read into it a reflection of poor performance of the currency. Just because we exist in a monopolistic or monopsistic/oligopolistic economy doesn't mean the value of the currency is decreasing: it means market capture and lack of regulation have allowed entities a free hand in price-gouging.

And that is a distinction with a difference, because folks who believe in the quantity theory of money, can argue from that that public spending should be curtailed to fight this boogeyman called Inflation. Debt-free public money creation is one of the only policy levers we have to actually equalize the massive inequalities in our system. So it prevents the most important and needed class of public spending, this mythology which is being offered here.

edit: I should say I'm not against inflation measures if they are seen as a quality-of-life index. Quality of life indicators don't lead people to speculate about the need to curtail public spending. Someone can make the case that they can't afford a good education or insurance, without trying to imply that their dollar is therefore less valuable.
clearly they haven't met the public in awhile, nobody I know is calm unless their head is in the dirt over all this."
'Unity of opposites' Simultaneous hyper-deflation and hyper-inflation are occuring,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/lwu1ny/unity_of_opposites_simultaneous_hyperdeflation/,"We aren’t having “hyper-inflation in financial assets” (hyper-inflation is at least 50% inflation per month in a year). And we certainly aren’t having a “hyper-deflation” in the physical economy. We aren’t even having much or any deflation at all. All in all, we’re having low inflation in the physical economy on average.

If we don’t see inflation in the real economy, what your describing is a humongous bubble that will continue to get bigger. All bubbles pop. And the larger they get, the larger they pop.

If your insinuating we won’t ever have inflation in the real economy, I’d ask when has there ever been a historical case of a collapse of society due to “hyper-inflation of assets” and “hyper-deflation of the real economy”? In other words, when has there ever been a bubble that never popped?
I agree. This is what I am seeing.....it is a combination of massive inflation and massive deflation at the same time.

A lot of this has to do with a completely degenerate monetary regime. The only option that the FED and Treasury have is to continue to print money in order to prop up the stock market, real estate, etc. If they stopped printing everything would collapse but if they continue printing everything is still going to collapse except in a more bizarre distorted manner like what we are seeing.

Oddly enough, you have groups now targeting certain sectors of the economy like silver in order to buy it all up and try to break the comex and then you have other groups targeting stocks like GME in order to try to liquidate hedge funds. 

We are in the end game in my opinion, I don't see how this can continue on for very long without something breaking.
Im not seeing deflation in the physical economy, i am seeing massive inflation and i am tired of pretending like i dont
#everything for material standard of living is in double or triple digit inflation right now Lumber Cotton Food Metals Housing College Healthcare etc....

Where the fuck is all this deflation everyone is talking about? So what if i can buy a 80inch TV for $500
I can’t remember reading so many words and
Disagreeing with all of it before.

Your view of inflation is based upon a narrow view of simple economies.  Only hyper going on is the hyperbole you are spouting out.  Hyper inflation is not happening.

Will there be an increase in inflation - 100% yes.  But hyper inflation... nope.

Also stocks are not worthless.. that’s just a silly comment.
Yesssss unity of opposites just like how Joe Biden didn’t win the election but also won the election at the same time.  Or how the liberals are taking the gun away but we still have guns.  Or how we should make a stimulus.  Wait no needed no stimulus required ✨ 🙌🤩🙌✨ hale 2021 the year of unity of opposition
You might find this to be an interesting read: [FOFOA: Deflation or Hyperinflation?](http://fofoa.blogspot.com/2011/04/deflation-or-hyperinflation.html?m=1)

Admittedly long-winded and hard to follow at times, but a fun read when you have time to burn.
While your observations aren't inaccurate you're not really drawing any conclusions.
I love how you articulate this. Someone in another post bashed me for saying we are experiencing both inflation and deflation at the same time. Because I didn’t explain the details. It’s simple f****king math really. Cultural and economic decline. We are buried under lair after lair of lies and brain washing thanks to corporatism and marketing but at the core it’s just sheer greed. Whats the solution. Mobility. Diversify investments and look to crypto. If you think crypto is not a thing think again. Rejecting it is like renouncing running water and electricity in homes. It is the future. Goodby America. You were great there for a minute. If you take away all the military power you have a country sliding down the scales. Europe and Canada too. For those who think the US is still a great country read Brave New World or 1984. Also now, Fahrenheit 451 too because you know...
This is exactly why the younger generation should not save for retirement. All these pension funds and sovereign wealth funds that get their returns in the stock market will never be able to pay the return they promised in real inflation adjusted terms.

You see, the stock market is a ponzi scheme that requires new suckers to pay the people who are cashing out. That is how capital gains works. With the younger generation is poorer than ever, how can they afford to buy the stocks the boomers are liquidating for retirement money?  Also, having less young people in the far future means less people to buy stocks from the older ones. With these combination of poorer and smaller population growth size equals massive disaster for the stock market.

A common rebuttal against this is, the company can always buy back its own shares. Can they though? Yeah. Right. With printed money from the government. A wave of massive inflation is going happen in the future as government around the world fire up their printer and print into oblivion. There is no escape from inflation.
Question: What happens to the meager cash savings of people like me with no investments outside of a public service pension. I have like.. $7000 in my bank account. Is that just going to get inflated away?
Was intriguing but then the dude said “intrinsically worthless stocks and bonds” and I realized it’s basically just a little rant of someone who doesn’t know much but has to vent. It’s okay.
Yes essentially, the stock market and the real economy are actually INVERSED right now which is bewildering. Graham Stephen on YouTube did a great video on it. Stock market should have had a major correction during Covid. (Think 50%+ instead of the 20% we saw) He discusses how the stock market is still climbing and that if economy does well  and reopens it would drive inflation. (Stock markets hate inflation) However, if the economy doesn’t really fully reopen then overall it will suffer and the market will continue to sit artificially high.
I came here to post a perfect reply:

What we see Today is Schrodinger's Economy, which is Both Inflation and Deflation at the same time. 

This pretty much sums it up.
I found this post and replies most enjoyable and eye opening.  My question, if anyone can answer, is how does one prep for this a/k/a 'ride the wave'?  There does not seem to be any good place for money right now.
You have car 'companies' with low annual production trading at nearly a trillion in market cap.

Companies with no assets no profits no staff just concepts are in the tens of billions. Billionaires are being 'minted' daily in the financial sphere despite not 1 ounce of new value added.

You have hedge fund guys paying 50-60 million for tiny lots in Miami where the median wage is like $12 per hour.

Things like 'cryptocurrencies' are up millions of %.

Meanwhile in the physical economy you have collapsing infrastructure, homes selling for $1 in previously prosperous industrial cities(detroit and much of the north east). Regular blackouts in California. North eastern cities have depopulated at staggering rates despite no war and a general increase in the population over the past 60 years. There has been no new cities formed in the US in 70 years etc.

&#x200B;

Hyperinflation of monetary assets means an INCREASE in DEBT.  Banks lend money for sharebuybacks  at high inflated prices which then impose draconian austerity on the physical firm to actually deliver the profits to keep the price inflated.

That is what is happening all around you. The physical economy(labor) is experiencing rapid entropy / deflation while the monetary economy is experiencing hyper inflation.  Productivity in the economy is in complete freefall for decades now due to cognitive resources being diverted to wall street or 'where the money is'.

The economy collapse is being caused by a unity of opposities that CANNOT be modeled using sense data, hence why all these economists do not see whats happening. The economists think that a 'rising stock market' means \*more wealth\* in the physical economy. Its like thousands of years ago where they saw the sun spin around the earth and thought thats reality.

Imagine you lived thousands of years ago and looked at the sky and merely wrote down what you observed happening. All your data is meaningless as you never assimilated the actual \*principle\* behind the sense impressions. You'd walk around telling everyone that the earth is flat and the sun revolves around it etc and your data would be your evidence. This is what we have now for economics, mechanical linear models that tell us nothing.
Those 'groups' are the same like-minded speculators. The entire GME thing is wallstreet banks targetting young deracinated males who are not going out into the economy to be creative are not starting families but are sitting in basements gambling on options \*inbetween\* themselves.

Imagine a corner store in the ghetto where all day the same group is tossing dice against a wall with their government welfare money except its happening on the internet.

Add to that analogy, rigged dice(hedge funds) provided by the games organizer(robinhood).  


Reddit which has been a huge source of depravity and mental disorder among young males goes perfectly along with it for the user growth.

&#x200B;

The physical economy is breaking down everyday as hardly any new capital is being formed, hardly any new families are being formed and less and less \*real\* technological progress is occuring as more and more people are reduced to debt serfs 'servicing' the top 1%.
Deflation is what \*should\* be happening but isn't yet -- basically, I don't know how you can avoid it with population set to radically decline in the next 100 years (birth rates already cratered, elderly will be fastest growing demographic group).  Global population is realistically not even reaching the low end of UN estimates.  The depression since 2008 has hit family formation hard.  In theory, aggregate demand should crater sometime this century, and along with it, we will get deflation.

But yes, due to the synchronized central bank policies worldwide, what we are seeing is hyperinflation now.  It feels ""good"" to finally be proven right, since I'd been predicting hyperinflation from the disastrous/ruinous fiscal and monetary policies since 2008.  But for the longest time the inflation was still not quite noticeable enough that they could deny it (still probably 8-9% / year in some years).  But now it's just gone totally haywire.

The final push to destroy the middle class and centralize wealth is here.  Inception of neofeudalism.

EDIT: Judging from recent experience, it seems that there is a lag time from QE to hyperinflation of more than a decade.  This is what I did not factor in after the last crisis.  It takes time and Black Swans to get to Zimbabwe or Weimar Republic inflation.
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/inflation-2021-malnutrition-and-hunger-fears-rise-as-food-prices-soar-globally
That TV wasn't made in America that's why it's cheap.

College, Healthcare, food, cotton, lumber all comes from here.

Using a a cheap TV as an argument for deflation doesn't work since it wasn't produced in USD.
There are other factors for price of materials other than   inflation. If there is more demand than supply prices will go up and vice versa. What we are seeing is that it will cost more to make thing but companies won't be able to pass on the price to the consumer
I think its you that has the narrow view.

There are 2 'economies' operating, one is the creative physical economy that people engage in daily and the second is the 'money' economy where everything is zero sum. The money economy has been experiencing extreme rates of inflation since the 70's.

As an example the value of the DOW which is \*suppose\* to reflect the value of US industry was around 700. Today it is around 30,000. Are you REALLY going to tell me the total value of the US industrial base has increased by a factor of nearly 50? The exact \*opposite\* has happened. The US industrial base is smaller today than 50 years ago measured by \*none\* monetary units. You don't need to be a genius to drive around and see all the devastated industry scattered around the country.

Since the money unit ie dollar represents DEBT, the higher the \*nominal\* value of the financial instruments the more load they put against the real physical creative economy. From this you get a total decline in the labor forces cognitive capability because it is drained having to support the massive DEBT(rents, fees, mortgages, insurances) imposed by the monetary economy. This is causing DEFLATION in the physical creative economy. Just look how physically SICK most people are today from having to consume cheaper and cheaper calories just to make it through the month.

As stocks go higher and higher while the physical economy shrinks they become worthless and eventually would end up with a \*REAL\* value of ZERO as there would be nothing to buy.

You could have the dow at 2 million but everything around you is collapsed. This is where we are headed if this system continues.

14 months of a pandemic and the NOMINAL fortunes of billionaires are at record highs while more than half the population requires government payments not to starve.

There are 2 ways out. Reduction in the debt overhead destroying whats left of the creative economy or hyper inflation and decades of poverty.
Did you ever read ""Another"" ?
Crypto is a terrible currency and backed by nothing. At least the usd has oil and aircraft carriers. It is pure speculation.
The correct and accepted term is “stagflation “ . Unhappily brought to you by the Nixon years...
People have a hard time understanding that the physical economy which is based on human creativity for growth is completely the opposite to the financial economy which is zero growth zero sum, someone loses someone wins.

Unfortunately the financial economy drains the physical economy as it needs its inputs to live.

Heres the analogy of our economy.

Imagine a gang playing dice on a corner store all day. Whoever wins that day gets to decide what house will be built, what food will be served . This is done by the subjective spending decision of the player.

Where do the winnings come from initially? From the gangs own bank which 'lends' the players the money in hope of a return. The bank creates the credit to loan to the players as a debt against them with interest.

Where does everyone else fit into this? The actual producers in the neighborhood that the gang members live off of.

Why they are \*forced\* to accept the gangs own currency by imposed taxes against their creative labor. Since taxes are payable in the gangs currency, goods and services are priced in that very currency.

The entire physical economy is then beholden to the dice players and their subjective irrational spending decisions. Maybe a big winner wants to build a huge mansion, so the neighborhood diverts its labor to doing so because that is where the wages are, maybe another one wants to eat lobster all day etc.   


Any investment decisions that the physical economy undertakes are also actively financed by the same gang bank with interest of course as the gambling den which is the source of 'trickle down' in the neighborhood.

How does the neighborhood \*physically\* look and feel like as a whole? A total dump as the human congitive capacity is left undiscovered and the physical infrastructure degrades from all the funds being diverted to the gangs operations. Welcome to modern America.
Sure. Would still show $7,000 in your bank account, but after a “crash” the $7K does not allow you to purchase as many things (doesn’t have as much value in the market).

IMO this market will crash 3-6 months after everything really opens up again (Post-COVID), everyone starts purchasing a lot more and the stupid “Trillion $ COVID stimulus packages” go away.

Supply won’t be able to keep up with the demand and so prices on supplies will sky-rocket. This is already evident in many industries (wood, lumber, etc). Prices of everyday consumer goods groceries/gas/etc will go way up and everyday people in lower/middle class won’t be able to afford the new day to day purchases.
Its not bewildering if you think about it. Let me try to explain how it works.You need to understand that in a fiat free floating exchange rate regime, all money is debt. If you have a positive bank account, someone else has a negative bank account.

In the nominalist metaphysical worldview the value of a stock of a company is seen as something completely independent to what it represents, that is ownership of a business. Its not the business per se that drives the stocks value but the subjective perception of value that a stock buyer projects onto it no matter how irrational(rationality is denied by modern minds).

So under this presuposition, banks which supply money(debt) have no problems lending against stock because they observe what a stock cost \*in the past\* and assume it must have value if someone paid X. From this you get margin debt, sharebuybacks etc. The lenders \*do not\* look at the objective business itself if its feasible and if it has profit growth potential which can only come from productivity improvements, they look \*only\* at the subjective perception of value known as the last sale price.

When banks issue credit to inflate the stock market they are by definition expanding debt but there does not necessarily exist a new productivity backing the new debt, since as I stated above the prices of stocks \*do not\* reflect the objective enterprise. This means a stock can increase in price while its objective business is falling apart, so these news \*debts\* are imposed on the existing economy.

When the capital gains is realized the existing economy is burdened with ever increasing debt that is not backed by any corresponding increase in productivity. So you get looting occuring where the physical economy collapses as the stock market continues to move higher and higher.

One sign of this collapse is how \*primitive\* the new business's are getting. You have IPO's of low wage unregulated taxi cab companies, primitive bicycle food delivery services, crypto brokers, photo sharing services.

Another sign of this is 'multi million' dollar homes built out of cheap materials in areas where the infrastructure is in a state of collapse.

So the debt based inflation is occuring across a broad base of 'assets' which are in reality liabilities against the real economy.
It comes down to 2 dynamics at play. Monetary inflation running at double digits per year reflecting in the perpetual rise in financial assets while cost-push inflation remains low because wages have been decimated through decades of demoralization of the workforce.

The ultimate avatar of a demoralized, irrational man is the homosexual. And this is who the oligarchy promotes as the ideal citizen. No family, no use of reason, a slave to vice and passions who blindly consumes anything given to him. Easy to manipulate.

We are now at the 'service economy' where low wage menial work dominates and serves the top 5% of the population which is composed of an entire minion class who works servicing the oligarchy at the very top. You have oligarchs like Bill gates practicing medicine without a license and obsessing over a vaccine fetish.

So you have deflation in the real physical economy a kind of stagnation and death, while the magic economy based on financial alchemy is booming.
You can't.

Even if you make nominal billions you still are stuck using the same crumbling physical economy as everyone else.

What we are tumbling into is a neo-feudal economic order.

&#x200B;

Think of a place like Venezuela or South Africa etc where the 'rich' who made off in the crisis are stuck living in fortified bunkers. Are they REALLY rich? They are worse off then some lower middle class chump living in a region with a functioning physical economy.
I think we agree on a lot of the problems and see the same issues, we just come to different conclusions as to what it means.

I know assets are extremely over-valued. I’m not arguing against that, I think there is rampant inflation in asset classes (although absolutely nothing close to 50% inflation per month which is what hyper-inflation is generally regarded as). You can argue crypto is but there’s infinite crypto so you’d have to pick and choose specific ones which I could do with any huge company at nearly any time in history and say the same thing. I think the main thing to focus on is ever since those winners have gone mainstream. And since then, they have done really well but they haven’t been going up 50% per month. But I do agree with the inflation in assets and that’s my point of all of this. This is the definition of a bubble. This has happed countless times in history.

Tesla is a horrendous bubble. Imo, bitcoin is worthless, the mother of all bubbles, and a classic thing you see at the end of a private debt cycle. You have no utility out of it and no value besides it being a medium of exchange. Even if a crypto does gain heat to become a true currency (which I think is unlikely but possible), this is still a bubble comparable to the 2000 tech bubble where the overall market will crash 90%+ and many will “hyper-inflate” to nothing but some/one will come back strong over time. Tesla and btc have had an over 90% correlation b/w each other before Elon bought in. That’s called huge speculation. And huge speculation leads to huge bubbles which leads huge pops.

The stock market can’t go up at this rate in real value forever. It can go up in dollars forever. There are real value metrics people use. You’re not just buying some thing with a 100% subjective value like bitcoin which is pure speculation and can be valued at anything. You’re buying a real company that yields cashflows. At a certain point, it makes more sense to buy other things that are cheap. (For example, maybe some people invest in starting a new company start in which they can create bigger cashflows per dollar of investment than their stocks would.) This stock market is comparable to other bubbles such as US 1929, Japan 1989, 2000 tech, US 1835.

Do you know how insane Japan’s real estate market was in 1989? One building in Tokyo was valued higher than all the land in California! All of the land in Tokyo was valued higher than all of the land in the United States! You think that our asset inflation is worse than that??? And what happened to Japan? Did their bubbles grow forever? Or did their market drop 90% and real estate drop 60% within a couple of years followed by 20 years of no recovery in asset prices (even as they were doing QE) until the whole world went into QE in ‘08. And even then, they’re market has barely even gone up the last 10 years and has only just helped it bubble up a little. They’re essentially in a 30 year bear market and I don’t see it ending any time soon as they haven’t dealt with any of their problems and are in much worse long-term situations than the other developed countries dealing with the same issues.

You could have made the same argument you’re making if you were alive in 1929 when govt printed money to finance war and all of that printed paper found its way into the stock market and people took on big debt and margin debt in the stock market skyrocketed. But what happened? The bubble popped.

A currency can’t collapse without hyperinflation in the real economy and overall asset groups  can’t hyper-inflate without hyperinflation in the real economy. It’s literally impossible. For example, let’s say the govt “prints” a ton of digital money, hands it out to people, and everyone puts all that money into an asset such as copper. Then, let’s say we have a crash like 1929 and govt doesn’t step in. We get massive deflation and everyone needs paper currencies to pay their bills. All those people who bought copper to protect from inflation sell. Or maybe producers stop buying copper as the price is too high and it hits a tipping point. What happens to copper? The bubble pops and the “perceived money” in it vanishes. Of course, this situation is different bc the govt will step in but my point is that if the money is going into assets to create bubbles and not the real economy, the asset bubble will eventually pop and the money will “disappear”.

For the currency to collapse would mean hyperinflation in the real economy. A total lose of faith in the currency means it’s worthless. This means hyperinflation in everything as no one wants it, no matter the price. The bubble can pop up infinitely, but no without similar consumer inflation. History is extremely repetitive and extremely cyclical (and if economists had half a brain, it wouldn’t be that hard for them to follow and predict huge events and see massive bubbles). Massive bubbles are cyclical. UK 1720, US 1835, US 1929, US 2021.

Sure, there’s deflation in some things. There is always inflation and deflation in some things. But, overall, consumer prices are slightly inflationary. Wages are only stagnant for middle/lower class bc the economy is stagnant and the only thing growing is the bubble driven by debt. Private debt bubbles pop and you get a boom afterwards as new debt is freed up and you get more efficient companies with technological advancements, which will put the middle/lower class back on track and then some. Of course, if we get hyperinflation in consumer prices, this will be a little while longer for the boom as it’d be a semi-collapse of civilization. But my point is that it’s all happened before in history, and it’s all a cycle that repeats.

I think economic history is invaluable indicator of future economic events. So again, can you name one time in history a currency deflated in consumer prices/the real economy while the assets “hyper-inflated” in that same currency without the assets coming back down?

No, is it a book? Have a link?
It's technically complex, but if you can understand why a trustless, decentralized asset which is mathematically impossible to counterfeit could be useful then you will understand why crypto has value.

The physical economy is based on physical resources and the energy to do work with them (some 90% of which is fossil fuel energy). The exploitation of said resources is enabled by human creativity.

>Even if a crypto does gain heat to become a true currency (which I think is unlikely but possible)

The idea of crypto becoming a currency by itself is becoming more and more irrelevant. Let's say the folks behind crypto managed to solve the issue with high transaction fees, but crypto can never be a currency because it is mostly controlled by the wealthy. It is unworkable.

As for Bitcoin, it is slowly becoming a tool of the 1% to siphon and control wealth from the common folk. Look at who is buying up all the Bitcoin, Elon Musk, Michael Saylor, all of them part of the wealthy elite. These are the crypto whales you keep seeing in the media and they control the crypto market.

The idea of Bitcoin is to take control from the government and give it back to the people but it is going very wrong. Bitcoin is instead taking control from the government and giving it to the 1%. The majority of Bitcoins are held by the 1% and they effectively take over the currency. And when that happens, these people would have gain even more power than ever before.

One important fact to note though, since when has the 1% ever work for the interest of the ordinary person on the street? Crypto as a currency is unworkable unless the majority of the currency is held by the 99%. It is ""digital gold"" at best and nothing else.
I think were heading into the depths of a dark age unless there is divine intervention to uplift humanity once again.

Is isn't an asset though it is just a string of numbers backed by nothing.
The physical economy is based on the human mind being able to assimilate being and re-arrange it through the discovery of knowledge(principles). The potential for this discovery is \*infinite\* even though the physical resources around you are \*finite\*. The discovery and application of principles allows humanity to produce more while consuming \*less\*. This is the only true growth available to us.

The human mind can use its intellectual powers only if its \*cleared\* of distractions that hamper our ability to \*think\*. These distractions are called potentialities to sin. Sin keeps man in a state of ignorance where he is unable to see essences. The present system promotes sin and is increasing the \*ignorance\* of the masses making them much easier to control and enslave. Our present rulers do not believe in progress, they believe that man is an animal who must be controlled and that the human mind has no infinite capabilities because it is a mere finite material.

From this belief you deny all knowledge, all free will, all reason and instead base your society on \*guessing\* the future through the observation of what the senses tell us. The economy becomes a mere science experiment not based on findign a hypothesis but by provoking reactions and observing. So you raise interest rates to 20% in the 80s for example and \*observe\* what happens etc. The human misery it causes is completely irrelevant. We are currently being run on magic, alchemy and blind faith.
Bitcoin as a currency, most likely not. But a store of value and the ""gold"" standard for other cryptocoins that can function as currency is definitely possible. 

A 90% dump is inevitable.... but the question is from what price. 100k? 50k? Blatant parallels to the internet bubble. Coins like cardano which provide little to no functionality are up hundreds of percent and at 3rd/4th highest market cap is a clear cut sign
Yes, I agree.
100%. Nothing about our current situation is sustainable at all, to say nothing of the impending ecological collapse that looms on the horizon.
Your opinion, unfortunately, has no bearing on reality. Like I said, it is technically complex to understand. But the thing that is blocking your comprehension now is the belief that you already know.

How could something that is not an asset and is ""backed by nothing"" trade at a consistent valuation for over a decade? Perhaps you've misunderstood it, after all?
this is well said.
>cryptocoins that can function as currency is definitely possible

Crypto assets can only function as a currency if majority of it is held by the average working class. I am no fan of fiat currencies but they can work because majority of it isn't held up by the upper echelon of society in some private bank account.

These greedy elites can literally do things like manipulate exchange rates if they control the currency. What makes anyone think these people wouldn't use it to their advantage? Just when has the 1% ever work in the interest of the average person? The gold standard could work because majority of the gold supply isn't owned by the 1%.

Libertarianism has never worked and will never work. Just how does taking power away from corrupt governments and giving it to the 1% solve anything?
Lol someone clearly hasn’t done their homework on Cardano 😂
Consistent valuation means different things to you and me. It also is not hard to understand. It is an electronic distribution of a ledger. Super simple. I was a big early proponent but it is a terrible currency.
I have but feel free to enlighten me
I was confused by your insistence that it is ""backed by nothing"". That's sort of the point, to avoid the necessity of imprimatur by an authority.

Take gold for instance - is gold ""backed by"" anything? Does its value depend on being backed by something?
If out of all you’ve learned from Cardano is it, “provides little to no functionality” then I can easily cal out BS. It’s the equivalent of critiquing on a movie you’ve never seen, but you have regurgitated talking points you’ve picked up on to try to remain relevant.
Gold is also a bad currency. It shares many of the same issues as btc. If I had realized btc was digital gold instead of a spendable dollar I would have kept some.instead of spending it all and being bitter about believing.
40k transactions a day 31 billion supply not even decentralized yet. You can pretty much only send and receive. 4.4% apy

Algo 10 billion supply up to 1M transactions does almodt everything cardano only PLANS to do. 7.4% apy

Its baffling me and your response is useless"
End of Diesel Trucks! California is the First to Ban Them,56,https://afronomist.com/end-of-diesel-trucks-california-is-the-first-to-ban-them/,"how about build some fucking railroads.
Lol impossible
>""The original limit has been shortened by four years. California is pushing hard for faster implementation of zero carbon. But local governments need to lead by example. So they have set stricter rules. As early as 2024, half of new fleets must be locally zero-emission cars. Just three years later, they won’t be able to buy any fossil fuel vehicles. Local short-haul logistics, cargo machinery and port services must be fully electrified by the end of 2024.""
At the rate grocery stores are closing, they won't need them anyway.
And the mass exodus from California will now begin…….
California politicians-Let’s set some aggressive goals on zero emissions trucks that support our economy 

Also California politicians a few years later-why is everything so expensive in California? We must be getting gouged by the big companies.
California is killing itself
I'm 100% for electrification and reducing emissions, but 2024 for 50% of fleet is absurdly stupid and continues making CA a laughingstock.

How about raising taxes on full sized pickups, or actually patrolling and giving big fines to people who remove/bypass emissions equipment because they want to sound tough and ""roll coal""?

Another idea is raising registration fees on non-DEF semis to higher and higher rates (DEF removes something like 90% of pollutants and all modern diesel semis since ~2010 have it).
They want be getting or moving anything. Get rid of your governor fast.
People zero carbon is impossible.
What a dumb article, “and once again California is leading the way in ways to destroy their economy”
This should be reposted on the facepalm subreddit.  At some point,  the courts or fed gov has to save the state from the continual idiocy of its politicians.
Look, we all want a better future, but electric trucks need to be tested more in regards to safety due to accidents.
Doesn't diesel have much better gas mileage than gas? I know there are sulfites and some other pollutants, but as far as CO2 emissions go, its seems like a bad move.
California is in trouble with one man opinion.
They outlawed diesel trains too.
Yeah, itd make jobs and build important infrastructure
Absolutely insane decision given that the infrastructure can’t even support current electric needs. We have rolling blackouts all summer already.
r/Cascadia
Nothing is impossible, that said zero carbon just means the world doesn’t exist
Not sure about that. Californias economy is 3.7 trillion as of 4th quarter 2022

No we don’t!!!! There was like 2 days when there might have been a blackout and I believe it was avoided. Hardly all summer.

Give it time. About 2035 should do it
Correct.
I take it you're joking, or saying that tongue-in-cheek?  What area are you in? For the record, if your area has 2 days of blackouts, it's also not ready for this kind of electricity. But beyond that, California is a huge state, with quite a few electric companies, so just because you may have less where you live doesn't mean others don't have more. Needless to say, regardless of how many rolling blackouts you have in your area vs. mine, if any area has to turn off power as is, the grid cannot handle more power, and that needs to be dealt with long before adding more need.
If you’re in the majority of the US you’d better hope not. California props up a lot of states with their tax revenue.
Ventura county and I don’t think the power went out once, they threatened it when it got really hot it but it never happened. I understand your point, we will figure it out otherwise they’ll just push the requirement down the road like they do everything else.
I have no control over the states desire for self harm. Neither do the states it helps prop up. But that doesn’t make people wrong for pointing out that it’s stupid and going to hurt.
Ventura! I'm jealous. Yeah, your weather is so perfect and a lot milder than other areas of the state. It oftentimes hits above 110 for the whole month of July up in central California, which the grid can't handle when people are using A/Cs to survive.
Out of curiosity how many times did the power go out last year?"

I was reading what this idiot said over the weekend. he thinks we can just switch the economy off for 3 months and then switch it back on again and be right back to normal. Never mind all the people and small business that are now 3 months behind on their rent and bills. Do you think they will go right back to normal?
They need to get the ultra doomsday economic forecasts established now, so when the really bad-but-not-apocalyptic numbers land in a few months, the headlines can read, ""RECESSION NOT AS BAD AS EXPECTED.""
So what do we do??
Worse. GD unemployment was ~25%.
Keep in mind the fully automated cars and trucks will drop soon. Trucking is 2.5 percent of the workforce which will be eliminated over a few years. Not sure how big the uber/taxi market is, but it will just add to the damages. This will of course have a multiplied effect, as now there are less people with money to spend.
most of these small and medium sized business are going out of business right now. Totally finished. If this keeps up, no one will be paying any bills. Lenders will start going belly up, unless massive amounts of money are injected into all kinds of sectors which is starting to happen but this looks too late. They are way behind the curve. I think unemployment will head to 50% or more. Total collapse incoming. The dollar is finished too as the WRC. They are going to have to do a massive print and fiscal stimulus to get out of this mess which could cause hyperinflation of the currency later on, but I don't think the deflation of the ""System"" stops. Today, the markets are headed down down down even after the FED was given the tools to basically buy whatever including corporate bonds. Insane world.
Dominoes. Feedback loops.

I am not too sure except I don't think a lot of places will survive. Even hotels/facilities are laying off workers and management. I have been reading in my local area (Seattle) that restaurants are having a hard time paying $3000-$7000/month when this coronavirus pandemic hits. Also right now, we have a two weeks stay-at-home order but it could be extended. 

I honestly don't know what normal is except getting used to this being my new normal. I had to adapt and pick up  grocery jobs to keep my art studio and pay expenses. Unemployment is overwhelmed and it is taking a while. My coworker said if I can survive 18-24 months, then I will be better off than most businesses. My art studio rent is $170/month and I paid off our family's mortgage last year so I am not as stressed out as other business owners are but I know my friend's friends are struggling. Having 10 to-go orders isn't going to cover rent in Bellevue, WA (very expensive city).
Depression. And it's hard to see how it's not going to make 1929 look like a small beer.

The headlines will never call it a Depression. Unless Trump is still President, in which case they'll call it ""Trump's Depression.""
to be honest if you have cash flow problems and a line of credit with the card company it is probably smart to try to convert that credit into cash, even if it cost you spend some extra money in the long run with interest cash on hand will be key and banks can at will close your credit line with no warning.

Our money is going to be replaced. I don’t like him but he’s correct.
Mmmmm, I’m pretty sure its to back their currency, which will be necessary as the developing global reserve currency, especially considering the USD is solely backed by the good faith of the US government, and we all know what a shitshow that’s become.
Do you know what fiat is?
That’s because of inflation though, not from the dollar losing global status. That would cause home prices to dip.
Home prices are dropping and will continue to drop.
First, the US isn’t the “single most imperialist country that has ever existed”. Many others were far more imperialistic, most notably the British & the Mongols. Second, when was the last time the US took over a country? 

The trust, as it pertains to economics, is about whether a country’s currency is reliable. How could a currency that is subject to unilateral manipulation be a reserve currency? You understand the ramifications to smaller economies if the reserve currency value changes, right?
Our oil underneath us may as well be on mars when you have a net zero admin refusing to let us use it and instead would rather beg MBS to pretty please sell us some more of theirs at astronomical prices.
I’m pretty sure we’ve been sending our European allies all kinds of stuff: oil, natural gas, weapons. The US tends to have its allies’ backs, as long as isolationists aren’t in power here.

Oh for sure.  That's why he signed the Chip Act to help Xi build chips in the US.  Wait...
Point being, gold has as much faith as anything else... meaning using it to back a currency is like using a currency to back a currency. It's just silly
Yep
No sir, the massive amount of US dollars flowing back into the US to stay has been and will continue to cause greater than normal inflation. Combine that with the trillions being made and it’s nuts.

The US instituted a coup in Gran Columbia to split the country into now Columbia and Panama to create the Panama Canal.

We tax the US Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico without any government representation.

We overthrew the Hawaiian Monarchy. 

We committed  to War of Vietnam despite it having nothing to do with us as it was a French Colony that they lost control of. 

The Cuban Missile Crises was a lie the government strummed up because Cuba was receiving aid from Russia. There weren’t any nukes, but there were missiles. The country is sovereign and had no reason to attack America. We embargo the hell out of this island nation with literal ship blockades.

We destabilize the Middle East for resources. There were no nukes there during Bush Administration so awe lord again.

We’ve committed several other coups on sovereign nations to retain hegemony.

The way the Nukes we dropped on Japan killed between 130k to 230k people. Most of which were civilians.

 The other military bombings have killed 65k+ civilians in the Middle East. 

We’re an empire that commits a ton of war crimes that facade as a Federation of the free. We have no issue throwing our own allies under the bus.
Yes, at 10 times the price of Russian gas. So wholesome. As one US exporter was quoted by Business Insider ""it's insane, we are not talking profit margins any more, but profit multipliers"".

I am pretty sure Europe has to pay for all that weapons too, destroying their own military industry in the process.

After plundering Europe and crashing the EU trade balance overnight, the US then instituted Inflation Reduction Act, which means every European business that didn't move to China, will move to the US. EU officials protested but were sent home packing by the US representatives with cynical ""it's your problem"".

Truly, the US ""have their allies' back"", or as Kissinger would say ""To be an enemy of the US is dangerous, but to be the US' ally, is deadly.""

By now it's clear to everyone, that slowly declining US empire will cannibalise its ""allies"" as much as it can, before finally being reduced to 2nd rate power.

If the dollar was backed by gold and we were still on the gold standard then it wouldn’t becoming as worthless as it is. You can’t print gold but you can print a shit ton of money and keep diluting the value which is what we have been doing for way to long. The chickens are coming home to roost and the dollar is going to be good for nothing but lining the chicken coop at the rate we’re going.
> gold has as much faith as anything else

Gold is built on the premise that you need colliding neutron stars to make it in bulk, and few people have these lying around.
That’s not because of these currency discussions though… my point was that your comment about the us losing status leading to higher asset prices isn’t true, the us losing status would decrease us home prices.
Inflation has been coming down, and will continue to.
I just saw that. Now you can pay for the entire house 10 times during the life of the loan. Wonderful.
Doubt it. Cycles are going to cycle.
The US didn’t take over Iraq. It isn’t the 51st state or a US territory. You realize China has been busy setting up predatory infrastructure loans all over Africa, right?
I’m very well versed in history, my man. Nothing you brought up was recent. Is Panama part of the US? The US Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii ARE all part of the US (only Hawaii is a state, the three territories have relatedly voted to remain territories).

The nukes were used on Japan to end the war that they started, and they were warned. We didn’t even know how devastating it would be. There has only been 2 tests prior. So, your 20/20 hindsight in the issue is pretty weak

The Cuban Missile Crisis was absolutely real (even coming down to a Russian submarine captain refusing to follow an order to launch They’re nuclear payload). The entire thing was instigated by Russia, because whether a sovereign nation, or not, the US wasn’t going to, and still won’t, tolerate Russian threats.

Your argument doesn’t actually contradict anything I’ve said. US doesn’t take countries over, and as I’ve repeatedly said, economics is about good faith in a monetary system. That can’t be achieved for centralized, authoritarian regimes with a recent history of shady, financial behavior.
Whatever you say. You probably shouldn’t have ever made yourselves dependent on Russian gas & oil to begin with 🤷‍♂️ And, if it wasn’t for the US protecting you, most of the European continent would have been overrun by hostile powers a long time ago &/or right now. If you actually had to fully pay for your own defense, you also wouldn’t be able to afford all the lavish social programs y’all enjoy. So, distance yourselves from the US at your own risk. Maybe Putin & Xi will be kinder than we are…
Trump or desantis?
Lol, no it's not.  Some countries are agreeing to settle in other currencies, but that's just because US inflation is \_relatively\_ worse right now, so they dont feel like paying the fees.  But once one/any of those countries hiccups (again) like a hint of a coup in Brazil, or Xi cracking down a little too hard, or the Saudis seeing a terrorist attack-- everyone will come running back to NYC to re-do their contracts back in USD.
We can devalue anything. Let's assume finite amount of gold... we did... for many many years. And guess what? Its value continued to be measured in dollars, not the other way around. Any medium used to translate labor into value can be abused.
Yet the value of gold changes, is not constant, and is based on the dollar
How so? Those trillions of US dollars have to go some place.

And anyone with an ounce of sense will be further locked out of the home market. No. I wont pay $1m for a 1600 sq ft rancher on no land, at 7.5% for 40 years. Meanwhile, the poorest will be kept poor as they jump to be homeowners.
So they are imf now or world bank?
“Apart” of the US with 0. You mean taxation without representation right?  We overthrew the Hawaiian Monarchy. 

I’ve read a lot about the Cuban missile crises. Cuba had no nukes. Still they’re under embargo over half a century later. I’m not sure where the Russian threat comes into place here. I do know they hate that Cuba is communist. 

The US literally created Panama for the sake of that Panama Canal.

It took 4 nukes and over 120k people to realize how effective they were. Sure, but we dropped 2. Far much damage the the single Pearl Harbor attack.

You may actually be delusional. The US is an empire is retains global hegemony through economics and military. Just because we aren’t actively governing places directly doesn’t mean we aren’t maintaining imperial power. No matter how long ago some of these things happened an Empire isn’t built in a day.

Not really if there is a finite amount of it. And we don’t have to assume that. We already know that. Dollar values aren’t measured in gold since we came off of the gold standard. The gov does not like backing dollars now with gold or anything else since they can’t control the economy unless the can control how many dollars are a available. Good in some ways but that’s when eventually you push around wheelbarrows full of cash to buy a six pack.
The human value of gold certainly changes over time, and is relative. Paper fiats are but a brief blip in human history of about 50 kYears -- US dollar being the new kid on the block, and Bretton-Woods having ended only 1971, so the experiment is half a century old. And is not working in terms of store of value very well, empirically.

A more interesting comparison is gold priced in other scarce metals, like silver, platinum, palladium or copper. The latter being effectively constant since ~1980. Oil (WTI) priced in gold has been largely constant since ~1975 as well.
More capital would flow to whatever countries/currencies replaced the dollar if the us lost its current status.

OK. Just ignore data and do your thing.
Like the multi-generational mortgages that Japan had. This is why so many people are moving to the flyover states. Land and houses are cheap… for now.
Basically
If you seriously believe authoritarians are more trustworthy than the US, then you 100% ARE delusional
I don’t think we’re exceptional. I’m just pointing out that the fact that ppl rioting in France because the retirement age went up by 2 years says a lot. Imagine having to increase your military budgets by 40, 50+%. How are you going to afford things like socialized medicine & higher education. It’s just math 🤷‍♂️ The US has basically subsidized European defense since WWII, b/c our allies were more than happy to lean on us as the muscle.
How does that support the argument? Central banks sometimes move more into gold, sometimes less. USD didn't lose reserve status decades ago when the same thing happened.
[deleted]
In terms of metal, yes. Kinda my point, how arbitrary it is.
Gold may be finite but it's still measured in dollars
So you are saying that more US dollars will flow to whatever countries replaced the dollar? That doesn't make sense. If you have pesos and live in Canada, where do you end up spending your pesos? To say they end up in the US is nonsensical. Currencies go where they are spent, and if the USD is no longer being spent all over the world, they will eventually make their way home and increase the money supply.
It depends where in the ivory tower you sit if inflation is coming down still looks really high here on main st
The difference is that there is zero oversight for the CCP, whereas the IMF & World Bank have some oversight under the UN
I didn’t say that. I’m saying we are an Imperial power and single handedly the most powerful country in the world.

If I were another country, I wouldn’t trust the US any further then I can throw them simply because mutual interest is not in the US playbook.

Trusting currency is fine you best believe the dollar will continue to be backed by military might.
And, in case you haven’t been paying attention to your own backyard, you’d be overrun by Russia.
Did you read the article?
The beginning of that process is happening. All of the evidence is pointing to it.
It’s sorta a tradition 2000 years ago you could buy a fine suit with an ounce of gold and guess what? You still can.
Any medium of exchange is tied to labor, not some farcical metal. Print more money = increasing price of metal per ounce
Here on main Street it's been coming down more than in your ivory tower.
Doesn’t brics member countries have oversight of Brics policies? I would not call that no oversight.
I’m not sure what you’re arguing. We’re discussing the idea of the US dollar being supplanted by something else as the global reserve currency. You are stating that the US is the most powerful country in the world, which is absolutely true and only further bolsters the idea that the US dollar will remain the global standard for the foreseeable future 🤷‍♂️
Yes. Did you?
If you walk into a tailor and try to pay with gold, they're going to weigh it and look up how many dollars it's worth. So, no, you can't buy a suit with gold without its value being measured in dollars.
Yeah no it hasn’t, gas is four dollars cereal is seven a loaf a bread is 5 dollars and my coffee is like 7 bucks too, don’t even get me started on cigarettes I wish no one ever did.
China and Russia provide so much assurance! Lmao
So, I’m arguing against the idea that the US isn’t an Imperial power is all. The distrust can stem from other countries being bullied by the US and being fed up by it.
Yep. Central banks purchasing the largest amount of gold reserves in about 50 years. Starting a new trend deviating from reserves so heavily in USD.
Sure you can because gold isn’t weighed in dollars but in weight based metrics like grams or ounces. Only way to measure with a dollar is if someone draws a ruler on it. Duh
Wasn't gas higher last year? That would be deflation. Get out of the ivory tower wasting $7 on over priced coffee.
That’s only two votes tho of like 9 countries soon to be 26 countries…
That isn’t what this thread is about. I am all about that discussion. I wrote a comprehensive paper on US hegemony in 1999, but that’s not what we’re debating here. This is an economic discussion on the future of the US dollar
And? No where does it say USD is losing reserve status. USD is the most notable reserve currency and not the only one, and it's share fluctuates all the time.
Weight... as in dollars per ounce.
Where I live there is a nickel’s difference in gas and the coffee is just barely worth 7 dollars and can replace a meal. I save 3-4 dollars as opposed to Big Mac meal
9? Who are they? I know of 5 members: Brazil (who I think are trustworthy, but recently altered the value of their currency), Russia (completely untrustworthy), India (fairly trustworthy, but their position on Russia has been troubling), China (completely untrustworthy), & South Africa (rife with corruption). What am I missing?
Well I think the dollar is as risk due to the ever increasing alliance of BRICS+.
Weight? No weigh!
Average US peaked $5 last year in May and now is $3.50. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=12eLt

$7 is a lot for coffee. Bought two for that yesterday.
Bangladesh, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay are members of BRICS New Development Bank.
Okay. That’s what we’re discussing. I don’t think enough of the world is willing to put their economic stability in the hands of BRICS to supplant the USD. Too many of the member states lack enough stability and transparency.
Haha k that's pretty good
It will  be interesting to see what gas’s looks like in may with Saudi and Russian cuts if they even kick in by then I think it could be June. Saudi Arabia becomes a full Brics member I believe on 8/1 so that will apply additional pressure. I really need to go get my coffee lol I am also a 2 a day guy I feel there is great nutritional value the  McDonald’s. Just out of curiosity you have the figure for April?
Okay. Do you think they have the economic power and reputation to supplant the US dollar? I don’t
Well that is in large the problem. Most Western countries have switched to a service economy. They also generally lack materials and labor so they offshore those parts to feed into their own economy.

US has started to rollback child labor laws as a consequence for its shaky labor force.

Destabilization doesn’t have to just be trusting in another countries just put distrust in another countries currencies ability to buy from what I understand.
Yeah can’t resist a pun it’s like economic collapse
Their gdp combined is higher then USA so yes economic power is there. Tying a currency to commodities could be seen as more stable then on a currency that devalues every day and would be based on the commodity’s scarcity. So where as the dollar supports the ground and nation I stand on I do think brics currency could be better. If USA was back on a precious metals standard I might reconsider my position.
Sure, but without trust, they’re GDP is worthless
So what you’re saying is trust a bill you can send out for debt more then say a piece of gold or silver or maybe grain?
I’m saying that you can’t trust authoritarians
Do you think authoritarians trust each other? I guarantee they know their options and for whatever reason have deemed this the best one.  Besides who’s an authoritarian if all that is allowed is a monopoly. I am scared of destabilization of dollar but I think a multipolar world makes more sense then a mono polar world.
They band together in order to further their own interests. If they are able to destabilize the US, they will then turn on each other. It’s the oldest trick in the book - They make the US out to be their bogeyman, so that they can take more power for themselves.
And if you think authoritarians don’t pose a very real threat to global security and international peace, then we really don’t have anything else to discuss
Tada you just described invention of a form of democracy which apparently even authoritarians need
That’s no democracy, dude. Only temporary cooperation
Yeah decisions by committee is democracy. They may not give it to their people but hey at least they are trying it out #babysteps
One they allow it with their people, they will gain global trust. Until then, they have zero chance at overtaking the USD.
Playing democracy with themselves might lead to greater things for their people in future
There are many examples of authoritarians forming alliances. None of them worked out well
Yeah look at trumps administration constantly someone being kicked out
Exactly.
Because democracy overcomes authoritarian regimes eventually
I am not sure I agree with you on that, at all. The only thing that overcame authoritarianism in Germany, Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary, Japan, & Italy was major defeat in wars. Brazil, and since other countries, managed to overcome without a war, but the most powerful authoritarian regimes haven’t (Iran, China, Russia)"
Yellen spoke too soon. Had to frame this.,55,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/w5xnw0,"The ’crisis’ have now gone from once in lifetime, to once every decade, to once every 2 years.

The post 1971 monetary system has been an absolute failure for everyone except the top 0.01%.
It’s not a financial crisis we’re going through. It’s a class war. It’s simple math, the Feds know where all the money went and have the authority to reverse it. Stock market is up 75% since the start of the pandemic. Bezos and Musk are in a small peepee race to the moon while most of Americans are watching their savings get wiped out and millennials are forever priced out of real estate. 

Tax the rich. 
Tax churches.
Stop lobbyist bribes. 

It all comes down to money and math. They can figure it out but don’t want to.

This isn't a financial crisis.

Hilarious.

It’s here. Go away

If I worked like she does, I would have been fired a long time ago.  Transient?  I don't think she even thought this.
Who would have thought the Jimmy Carter junior would have ran for president and won?
The only thing dumber  is tax corporations which are not really taxable as they see tax as a cost of input and offset it with higher prices that WE pay.
Nobody would dare tax a black church. They could directly preach about specifics of who to vote for and allow those candidates to come and speak directly... wait... they already do that. On the other hand evangelical and those terrible faithful catholics... now members of those groups deserve nothing but scorn and derision. Got it. Woke much?
Cool it with the antisemitism.
It's not a financial crisis anyway. It's just a bad time to buy a house or have relied on Bitcoin recently. 

Interest rates up might at least drop excessive house prices a bit. 

I agree on the taxes and definitely lobbying. Churches use income to publicly lobby. Even if they're not directly telling you their choice by name from the pulpit, the community is well aware of the political preference. Charity funds get used directly for lobbying though organizations.
Taxation is theft.

Your version of society is fucked.
Tax churches? Who do you think is caring for the poor and providing a safety net? The government?  Lol. The largest provider of hospitals and education and social programs are churches. Don't blame them.
Stop with this tax the rich shit. You think any of that tax revenue will go to us? No, it will all go to replacing the millions of dollars of military equipment we lost in Afghanistan.

What we should be saying is:
“Stop taxing the middle class.”

If we didn’t have to pay 40% in taxes, perhaps we could actually afford a house.”

Black churches host singularly one party to preach from their pulpit and NOBODY balks at that. Interesting.
In your version of society, where do shared amenities come from?
We’re probably talking about different things. There are Churches and then there are CHURCHES. The ones I’m talking about are the larger ones in which the leadership have private jets, billion dollar mansions and push political agendas. They’re not doing anything for their congregations except collecting their money. I agree on the points you made. Thanks.
[deleted]
You don't know the movie I'm referring to do u?
Fun fact... not in usa
Is it interesting? Because I haven't seen anyone say, ""tax churches that push politics, except black churches!"" If you're talking about people reacting to particular messaging coming from churches, then that should be pretty obvious: Evangelicals want to control everyone else and limit their freedoms, black Protestants don't want to be disproportionately oppressed, incarcerated, and killed. 

Evangelicals push for bans on abortion, gay marriage and relationships, sodomy (which means much more than anal sex), contraception, pornography, alcohol sales (most cities have Sunday bans, some are completely dry), and marijuana, to name a few rights they want to take or keep away from everyone. What rights are black churches trying to take away from you and everyone else?
They don't come from stealing people's shit via threat of force which enables the parasitic class including the central bank that prints the fiat to have guaranteed funding who then create a mother fucking business model out of perpetual war and chaos for profit, globally, that's for cotdamn sure.

I know, you feel roads are worth the cost of all of that war and chaos. I disagree.

And before you try and back track or try and play your magically delicious statist mental gymnastics horse shit... here ya go:

""We have now sunk to a depth at which the restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men... Do remember that dishonesty and cowardice always have to be paid for.  Don't imagine that for years on end you can make yourself the boot-licking propagandist of any régime, and then suddenly return to mental decency.   Once a whore, always a whore.""

Once a whore, always a whore.

Edit2: nm, the user blocked me because I called him out as a boot licker, which is the term they recommended I google. Yes, I already knew you are a boot licker. No need to google.
Well you cannot choose which ones you tax. I understand your frustration. There was a guy back in the 13th century  who said  ""preach the gospel every day,and if ABSOLUTELY necessary,use words"". This is how good wins out.
You clearly don’t live in the Bay Area :).
Basic Instinct.
Google “Bootlicker”.
Calm down your name calling is not a discussion . It's a weapon of mental midgets .
But you can. It’s just numbers. Say ANY “Church” with $500k or more in donations per year (I.e. not the local, congregation-focused churches you’re talking about) get taxed at corporate rates. Simple.
So target the catholic church; the number one provider of hospitals, shelters, clinics, soup kitchens, drop in childcare centers, long term care centers, universities and international aid. Yep... this church is truly an enemy of the state. And who will pick up where they leave off because they will have to curtail these programs.
Yep. They’re not making any money in healthcare. Poor poor Catholic Church… /s 🤦‍♂️
So soup kitchens, adoption and drop in Care centers, write offs for medical bills, soup kitchens,and international aid means nothing to you? Obviously you have never been in a catholic hospital. The big one in billings is constantly writing off care but can we risk a non profit making a penny on those things.  I think your hatred is definitely outweighing your critically thinking.
WTF?! You act like there’s no corruption in religion or the Catholic Church or, I don’t know, POLITICS? JFC. Pull your head out. Billions of working class taxes could be alleviated by taxing people for their hobbies. Choose the church to give your money to, fine. Why there is an exemption?! Churches are like beer companies spending billions to market that they gave thousands to a charity. Wake up."
"JPMorgan Chase to raise mortgage borrowing standards, customers applying for a new mortgage will need a credit score of at least 700, and a down payment equal to 20% of the home’s value",58,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/11/jpmorgan-chase-to-raise-mortgage-borrowing-standards-as-economic-outlook-darkens.html,"Time to start sustainable communes.
20 percent?! No more first time home owners then.
Shouldn't that have been the case always? Why now?
this is how you start tanking the housing market
The 2008 global financial crisis was a direct bullseye hit right on mortgage lending.

Amazingly, covid-19 has made a bigger effect on the housing loan economy than the banking implosion in '08.  (Despite how indirect the connection is.)  And we're only just getting started with second-order economic effects of the economic melt-down.
When I was growing up, my parents always said putting 20% down on a home purchase is standard practice. For how long a period of time have people been putting less than 20% down??
Also any mortgages that is too big to flip to fannie or freddie are being put on freeze. which means no jumbo mortgages in big money markets like LA or Seattle.
/r/greencommunes
Trying to save their useless jobs
No, that isn't it. They don't care about the housing market, they care about making money. Houses are now likely overvalued. They need to protect themselves incase the price drops rapidly and the  home owner decides to forfeit their mortgage. This should be read as the major banks believe houses may be overpriced by as much as 20 percent, and likely to fall by that amount as well.
the housing market was melting down in 2007 but it took another year for all the damage to start blowing up banks in 2008.  Our banking sector is going to be a sewer of bad loans by this time next year. This crisis has a looong way to play out.
I has been standard practice but during every cycle they start finding some edge case way to weasel around those standards. There wasn't much of it happening this time compared to 2007 AFAIK.
SW Washington

Bought 3 bed 2 bath for $220,000 in early 2018, put like 3-4% down on a FHA loan
Most first-time homeowners put down less than 20% where I'm at in Seattle... 5-15% is the norm.
In Southern California most first time buyers put down 5-10% on Conventional Loans. High values in LA, OC, and SD make that commonplace as most first-time Buyers don't have the 20% ($100-$150k) to buy a $500k-750k house. Also, our rents are so high here that 90% LTV (loan to Value) on a purchase is still a better financial play than renting. I put 5% down on my house in Inglewood in 2017. Bought for $675k, current value $850-$900k. So within 2.5 years I'm at \~70% LTV and no longer pay PMI. (PS: I'm a Real Estate Broker)
Heck yes!!
when less people qualify to buy there are less buyers. Less buyers is less demand. more people desperate to sell and bankruptcies/defaults increases supply. we will see how the balance comes out.
That's interesting, because yesterday banks announced they will increase down payment to 20-40% though housing is affordable in my country. We had huge housing crash in 2008 and just now prices reached 2008 levels, but since then minimum wage increased 70%, average wage 40%. I was planning on buying an apartment myself, but will postpone it for some time, some people believe prices will crash down, but I feel a bit sceptical.

Looks like the market is already trading the housing sector down by 1/3 - 2/3rds (basically walked back 5 years of gains).  A lot of the numbers and housing reports come out with a 2-month lag, so we won't get the official details coming from the shut-down until like May or June.  Hard to imagine that the details won't be terrible when we get to see them.
You are right about that. But they don't care, they are there to make money. Also, housing is overpriced, it would be nice to see ordinary people able to afford homes without breaking the bank. But I doubt the drop will help people to afford housing. Instead, ""investors"" will buy them up and rent them out. We need to prevent this entirely.
hey 2007 called they want their crisis back

Hey can u dumb this down a bit ?
I’m having trouble getting it through my head
Just because a company is trying to fill a position, doesn’t mean they’re doing well. 

Really, companies fuck people over all the time. Why wouldn’t Coinbase?
Crypto is not user friendly for the average person. Exchanges facilitate accessibility by centralizing the process. Congratulations, you’ve invented banking, but worse and without federal backing.
Basically you after you buy crypto you want to put it in your own wallet and not a wallet on a server like Coinbase.  You can download Hardware bitcoin wallets and software bitcoin wallets that will store your BTC on your local hard drive or a USB stick, thereby ensuring you hold that crypto no matter what happens to the crypto exchange server
The whole point is decentralization. Custodial wallets are centralized services.

"It may be quiet here, but make no mistake the next stage of economic collapse is coming.",54,https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/ih9cmr/it_may_be_quiet_here_but_make_no_mistake_the_next/,"I think everyone's attention is on the fire, not what it's doing to the house. By that I mean that the pandemic, riots, and government shenanigans are front-and-center problems that have a secondary effect on the economy. 

Just the pandemic alone will cause decades-long ripples in our economy and a fundamental shift in our culture. I do believe that there is a strong potential for positive fundamental change, but man is it going to hurt getting there. 

I live and work in one of America's largest urban environments. My company has no plans to even consider reopening our office until 2021. Beyond that, the CFO is waging a completely rational campaign to permanently eliminate the significant costs of maintaining a luxurious multi-floor suite in one of downtown's most historic buildings. We've *already* rebalanced our budget to not factor in cleaning staff, snacks, office personnel, new desks and chairs for 2021 ... the list goes on. 

On top of that, we're making ""Plan B"" moves to sublet the office space with NINE other companies. These are all national or global companies with luxurious marble-floored headquarters in my city. If you are familiar with WeWork office spaces ... that's what corporate America is going to move towards. Or something like it. Smaller floorplans that you can use to keep a presence in a city for when you have important in-person meetings. 

Even further, among my peers also in leadership, the opinion is almost completely unanimous: nobody wants to commute ever again, we've proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that productivity goes UP working remotely, it fits our lifestyle much better, and so forth. My company took a poll of the workforce and 97% said they don't wish to return to the office under any circumstance ... even if the pandemic and the riots were suddenly gone. 

Going further stilllllllll ... many of the leadership team have already flatly stated that they have no intention to ever work from the office again, and that of course this mentality extends to their teams. This has been echoed by my peers in over a dozen local companies. 

Downtown areas are really organized around crystal towers that host a few big tuna anchor companies, with a smattering of others filling the in-between space, and lower levels of food and service to cater to those tenants. Obviously, if nobody is going to the office anymore all those services downtown that depend on throngs of business dorks won't be making any money. 

Let's think about who that is. Restaurant owners, all their employees who cook and serve the food. Taxi, uber, bus, and shuttle drives who hustle people between transit points. Dry cleaners and launderers who have pickup or bag contracts with those companies (I pressed, bagged, and hung all my suits six months ago. Posting from my boxers here). Catering companies who depend on lunch traffic and expensive corporate lunches. Even your commuter trains, maybe subsidized by the government, depend on ticket fares to stay in the black. Every single person at my company canceled their transit passes on the very first day of WFH. Nobody wants to take the train, partly because of the pandemic, and partly because of the riots. Even the security guards in all the lobbies are gone ... everything is locked up tight and boarded up.

Going further yet still. Because we've really only dipped a toe so far, my company has adopted a ""work from anywhere"" policy and as of right now, about 35% of our workforce is somewhere ""up north"" or in the rockies, or just renting an AirBnB to stay away from the city. 

Another step towards real instability is the housing market. Silicon Valley is already seeing residential rent prices plummet as broke millennials realize they don't have to pay $4000 per month to stay in a broom closet near their startup. Residential *and* commercial vacancy rates are already skyrocketing. We're beginning to see this creep into other Metro areas like Chicago and NY, too. There is a small ray of hope here, though, as it seems that people are simply moving a few zip codes over instead of literally fleeing to the four winds.

And just to throw one more log on the fire, think about anything related to automobiles. While it's true that some people are doing some road tripping, overall drivership is down. Way, way down. People are buying less gas, they're using up fewer tires, their cars are incurring less damage and having higher lifespans. Fewer oil changes, fewer body panel repairs, fewer replaced windshields, fewer wiper blade replacements bought. More money that's not changing hands in the new reality. The auto industry was already experiencing some serious angst ... now that car sales are plummeting they'll have to also reduce manufacturing capacity. Then all the 3rd party cottage industries will have to follow suit.

...


Millions of dollars used to change hands each and every day. POOF. Gone overnight. Many of those people will not be getting jobs back as the waves of restaurant closures hit us. We've already seen the ones with shaky business models close, and the second wave of closures is rippling through now. The third wave will hit the hardest, though. That'll be the people who had some stability and savings and threw it all into the business trying to outlast this nonsense. Those people will be well and truly fucked, because when their business fails, they will have nothing.

I'm just gonna stop writing now, because anxiety is spiking. I hope you are all doing what you can to clear debt, reduce expenses, and find sustainable ways to house and feed yourselves *for the next few decades*. Best of luck.
We gotta be ready for any major event coming up. It can go either way. Just don’t bet big on any direction when we can’t afford to be wrong. And definitely don’t borrow money to play.
Gov't bailouts >> stock buybacks >> market boom

As long as the tap flows it's all gravy, baby
Where is all this magic money going to flow in the economy? 

I just make bets on that, and my money gets bigger. Like the pie moves into my plate

Working class wages don't get bigger though, pie leaves their plate

. The economy is beyond absurd and it can last for a long time.

I don't want to own abstractions but I don't have enough to buy real bioproductive land for a community yet, will I cash into the real stuff during the final blow off top or will I hold the bags, this is the dangerous game we play
A lot of people seem to think that money and markets = the economy. When will we see the financial collapse?  I really don't know, I thought it would happen already but the context of the virus has made endless printing a viable route so currently we're on the train towards very high inflation imo. Travelling time unknown, and the route is ofc filled with major political events that cant have huge effects.

In the real economy we're really in  deep problems though. Productivity has stagnated, partly due to malinvestmenst into unproductive companies (the bailouts continues this to the extreme), and partly due to real world physical limitations to continuous productivity growth. Add on that increasing energy extraction costs (sorry, renewable are not ready to take over fossil any time soon) and increasing cost of climate change.

All this things mean that profits will go down for lots of companies. Still they continue to owe/take on new debt based higher future profits. It's a bubble that will pop eventually. Either through a crash or extreme inflation. The result is the same, the pie of available goods and services in the economy shrinks, and unless we find a way to better share the pie it won't be pretty.
Yes.

There's no way they can keep hiding it for much longer. 
This fall is going to be a shitshow and I have anxiety over it.
Simple, when markets start to dump, do the same. Right now it is gravy train.
Those Trump executive order payments are hitting reliacards in some states including back payments for those two weeks with no supplement. This should bouy the market
> Anyone got that eye of the storm feeling?

Feels more like after the snow has ended, when everything is quiet and beautiful, before the avalanche starts.
It's a typical double dip.
Doom is ALWAYS six months away....And when it doesnt happen, give it another six months...
Cars will last longer as you suggest and people will budget repair of old vehicles (keeping them for more miles) to avoid new car costs. Repair facility business may benefit. Shirt to medium term new vehicle sales should slump and used vehicle sales spike don’t you think?
Unless COVID-19 comes back with a massive wave in the fall/winter (which I think is unlikely), I don't expect another 10%+ fall this year. The virus is not as bad as we thought, and as more people realize that every day, things will bounce back to normal.

Here in my USA red state, life is pretty much back to normal except for the mask mandate. If you are in an area that is still under lockdown I can see why you might be more pessimistic, I actually just returned from a stay in downtown Seattle and I got seriously worried about the state of the economy but as soon as we drove into the suburbs it was again BAU (albeit with masks). 

Financially, this has been an amazing year for me between the crazy market returns and forced savings. I'm honestly more worried about high inflation over the next couple of years. Due to everything being closed over the last few months I have accumulated a huge stack of cash that I don't know what to do with. I'll probably just end up paying down debt or look for residential real estate in urban cores, but the rest of my assets are 100% in equities. I don't think it's just high earners, I think the stimulus and unemployment cash were probably net positive for a lot of people as well, and as long as they can get back to work, I don't think congress' failure to extend will make too much of a difference.

IMO, COVID was the deflationary shock, we are now going to inflate the currency to pay off the debt as we work ourselves out of this hole.
chaos is coming [https://imgur.com/a/h23KL4m](https://imgur.com/a/h23KL4m)
I think we have until 2030. You have a little less than 10 years to make your moves and invest in what you need. After that, civil wars, economic and societal collapses are coming on a global scale. If you're lucky, most of your country will make it. Otherwise, have fun trying to fight off your local self imposed feudal lords.
Fantastic analysis. I would only add an additional issue: Travel, which includes regular business travel (business meetings) as well as conferences. All the businesses that support these two areas, from airlines to hotels to expo setup to booth swag, are all going to be sucking wind for a very long time.
I loved what you said about people not wanting to come into the office to work ever again.

I'm sick of how over priced the housing is in the big cities. House prices are easily 4x the cost of building them (materials and wages), and often much higher. This is destroying people's quality of life, as housing ends up consuming most of their income.

My only realistic hope for housing prices to fall is for work from home to become the new reality. With the freedom to live anywhere, many will flee the big cities. Each job lost will bring more jobs with it. Imagine what happens when the high payed tech worker leaves, all of the services that support them such as fast food leave as well.

This is why I'm very happy to hear your comment on the matter.
We cashed out and bought land six years ago.  It's taken that long to get it vaguely bioproductive and to learn enough to begin to eat off of it.

Edit: did my first home-made BLT today, with locally made bread, our own lettuce, our own tomato, our own duck egg mayonnaise (store bought oil though), and locally raised home made bacon.
That's good in theory, but you're picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. Who's going to buy when everyone starts to dump? Be careful my friend.

The economic problems we are facing are not due to the pandemic, the pandemic was only the trigger for the future economic collapse we will experience. There are several business ""doing good this year"" that does not mean we are not heading to a depression.
Goooooold and silver
With travel comes tourism, and all of its associated businesses.  I live in a smaller community that usually has a large influx of summer visitors to help drive the economy, and it's been really quiet - multiple places have permanently closed due to lack of customers.
Yeah, I didn't even get into that, and I probably should have given that some words. TLDR, travel (pleasure and business) is also poof. A massive pillar of the global economy.
> many will flee the big cities. 

I've already made it clear to my executive leadership team that I intend to sell my house, move rural, and work remotely. I'd still fly in every now and then for big meetings. 

Immediately after my post, I had a catch up meeting with another colleague who volunteered out of the blue that she and her family were prepping, had a bug out plan, and intended to move out of the city permanently. And she is the most normal mom type ever. 

I know my experience is anecdotal, and I know that not everyone has the luxury of working remotely, but the trend is clear. Everyone around me is talking about this. It comes up in every conversation. With the people on my team. With my boss and other leaders. With friends in other companies. Now it's popping up frequently as forum topics. There have already been reports that rural land is selling like hotcakes.

I just wonder what all the people who used to depend on cities will do. Ultimately I think reducing urban congestion and spreading out a little will be good, but I do think things will get bad first.
He's right on the facts but not on the timing. In reality none of us could have imagined the steps the Fed would go to keep this pile of garbage afloat.
You are right the problems aren't due to the pandemic, the problems are due to the idiotic lock downs still being enforced in parts of the country 6 months later. Put me under the T.Doubt column for incoming depression. I have been listening to the same bullshit since 2007. The economy was great in January. The main problem with our economy is debt and an overextended stock market. The fed will inflate the debt away and everybody will be ok with it because there is no alternative to the USD unless you're dumb enough to buy Yuans or believe in Bitcoin. Ditto for the stock market, there is simply no alternative.
In regards to your friend moving rurally I would advise to deeply research possible locations in regards to medical services, shipping, distance to urban shopping, crime rate, politics, and weather, as well as insurance rates, property taxes and emergency services. And to not share with her new neighbors that she is a preppier. Getting involved with the local volunteer fire department and CERT can help build community contacts and friendships.
Yeah, we kept it brief but she did acknowledge a need to practice discretion. I've researched all those factors (and others like 2A sanctuary status, news about local PD and sheriff, news of recent local elections, HOA boards and property values in the area). 

what is CERT?

Thanks for the great response.
Community Emergency Response Team which respond to local disasters often in conjunction with local office of emergency services. The training has become standardized nation wide. If you look up Los Angeles CERT their web page has a lot of resources, or go to your parish or county Office of Emergency Services web site. 

I recently worked with ours at an evacuation site for the large fire complex near us. And we assisted the Red Cross that set up the site and shelter for evacuees.
That's really cool, I'll put that on my list for sure."

I had a job with my buddy Lou. Company went under. Doing gigs now. It sucks.
During the 1929 crash the Dow moved up 5 months straight before rolling over for three years.

During the 2008 crisis it took the markets almost 500 days before it bottomed out seeing bullish momentum for a few weeks during those time.

Give it some time, the markets will fall once again, there’s only so much the feds can do before reality grips these investors.
Its actually still early days in the financial bear market. I posted in the general thread some charts and stuff. There are divergences combined with extreme overbought condition.
2021 will be different.
I'm afraid you're right, just that in this post-truth world they're going to loose their minds on whoever Trump scapegoats as the cause of all the misery. And then the left will increasingly loose their minds over the mind loosing Trumpsters. 

While this cultural war escalates the real elites keeps positioning themselves for the next step, the transition to neofeudalism aided by authoritarian technologies

Reality and the market are not the same thing.... but they eventually end up in the same place.
Oh I know. I've been calling recession for the last year and after reading about the horrible corner we've painted ourselves into the last year alone, I started to think depression was on the horizon. I say well know in 3 months"
So how fucked are we exactly?,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/14qxdpq/so_how_fucked_are_we_exactly/,"We are headed towards the perfect storm. Environmental, geopolitical and economic failure. A good place to begin to better understand this mess is ""Limits to growth"" by Dennis Meadows.
We're about as fucked as you've heard. Like world war fucked. It happens... all throughout history. It tends to repeat. But getting that fucked  doesn't happen over night.
Keeping a society functioning requires intellect.  As math and reading scores show, these skills and the brains behind them are in decline.  Planes crash or barely miss each other, the electric grid gets more fragile, cities turn increasingly into violent hell scapes.

Imagine what happens when in the future no one knows how to grow food, purify water, repair a generator, or perform an appendectomy.  That’s our future.
I think it's easier to describe what's going on then let you decide for yourself.

Our current system is built on the idea that capital is invested to get back more capital. Money is loaned with the expectation that the principal + interest is paid back. Stocks are bought with the expectation that they can be sold for more later. Employees are hired because the expectation is the employee will earn more for the company than they are paid in wages. There are more examples but I will stop here.

Always getting back more means growth. If we look at the numbers we are actually looking at exponential growth where the doubling rate is at around 25 years. Exponential doubling means every 25 years we use more of x (fossil fuels, iron, concrete, etc.) than we have previously during the entire existence of our system.

If you don't think we have enough stuff for another double, what breaks? How do you think it will break?
I’d give it a seven.
Dont forget food shortage... Alot of meat producers are having a problem with drought and cant feed their animals. Also Anyone heard of the BRICS which are all leting go of the USD, so its only a matter of time before the dollar start losing value. Also so many food processing factory have been destroyed in the USA in the last year so...
We’re at a breaking point for credit. However, if you are invested in real producing assets then you’ll be fine as these are foundational to modern society. 

For example, if you are invested in electric energy using fossil fuels, then you’re kinda fucked since it requires oil, which is depleting. However, if you own a solar or wind farm, then you are winning since it’s practically a one-time cost without recurring expenses and you generate real electricity with that asset. It produces revenue with little operating cost.

Most of society is fixated on investing in asset classes that don’t really provide a product or service foundational to our society.

Things such as investing in NTFs, hype retail stores, and other highly indebted corporations with negative cash flows.

Commodities such as agriculture, clean water, electricity, metals, etc. are what it takes to continue growing. Services such as farming, water delivery, power generation, metals refining, etc. do the work required to drive society forward.

I believe if you don’t want to lose, buy into the future by positioning your work to revolve around the commodities required to sustain human life. If you feel that your job description isn’t producing real value, then re-think your future trajectory.

In conclusion, I doubt we’ll go into Mad Max type shit because even in Mad Max there was a refinery.
People have been saying the great depression was coming since the last great depression, then we had the great recession which was pretty fucking bad for many. 

But alas here we all are still alive, most people still busting ass to make their corporate overlords richer.

So what are you even talking about?

Just do what people did to survive the last great recession, get unemployment, food stamps, have savings , have a useful job, grow a garden, keep your bills extremely low etc...
If it makes you feel better, every time someone predicts a catastrophic collapse, the exact opposite happens and business as usual ensues. This has been consistently happening since 2008

Works like fucking magic.
“ Children wielding baseball bats are reportedly attacking and robbing helpless mothers and nannies in a wealthy San Francisco neighborhood known for its young families.”

The Great Collapse is just beginning.
Different parts will fail at different times and places. It won’t all go to shit all at once (unless we have a nuclear apocalypse in which case none of this will matter).

The most fragile and perilous part in my opinion is the fragility of our food supply chain. My advice is to encourage local supply networks and making friends with farmers. 

The next big danger that will confront us is climate change. This one’s a little bit trickier to deal with but moving to a location that won’t be too adversely affected by climate seems to be the safest bet. Petitioning governments and protesting for substantive change isn’t bad, but it has proven to be only a moderately effective strategy.

Peter Zeihan’s The End Of The World Is Just The Beginning is a lucid and easily digestible analysis of where we stand now and possible paths forward. But be advised, while he has excellent data he wears his biases on his sleeve. Plus as the title suggests, it isnt the most upbeat reading. Best have a strong drink ready
I've lived through several recessions, the S&L of the '90s, the dot-com bubble, 2008 financial crisis; Covid.

I cannot recall any of these affecting me in any meaningful way at all.

However, there is a moment in my life where 10 seconds completely changed my future.  If that hadn't happened, I can imagine myself having become homeless or at least desperate.

So when you ask ""just how fucked are ***we***"", the ""we"" is kind of meaningless.

Dedollarization has been happening for decades.  The failed sanctions against Russia has somewhat accelerated that phenomena.  But this isn't some process that is going to destroy the American economy overnight.  It will still take decades more.  You might consider looking at the arc of the British Empire.

There's a youTube video on the arch of empires that I recall was produced by Peter Thiel.  I looked for it for about 15 minutes, but can't find it.  I know it has been posted on Reddit by several people including me.  Anyway the conclusion is the American Empire is in decline.  (it was neo-liberalism along with the collapse of the Soviet Union that -- IMHO -- lead the Oligarchy to think they were ""smart"".)

There is no single source for you to determine the answer to your question -- unless you want to listen to some talking head like Cramer or Zeihan.  Their job is to scare you or embolden you to make short term decisions.  In two months they'll be giving you an entirely different take to push you into yet another direction.

Michael Hudson is one of the economists that I find makes the most sense out of what will be happening.  He has an [interesting history on empires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4DkZ3CWFOk).   He has decades worth of analysis that is available.  He doesn't tell you anything about short term events.  It is all long term.  So anywhere you find his stuff is a good place to look.

You can find a lot of Hudson on the [Geopolitical Economy Report](https://www.youtube.com/@GeopoliticalEconomyReport).  Ben Norton has a periodic video that explains the BRICS and SCO and dedollariztion.  

There are several channels from there, I totally recommend Aaron Good's American Exception series.  It puts the American Political system into context since the Nation's founding.  I'll sum it up like this: ""The USA was founded by crooks and is still run by crooks"".  There are over 20 hours of video backing up this claim that include the Mountain of Gold in Indonesia; Nelson Rockefeller in the Amazon; why central America is called ""Banana Republics; the reasons behind the JFK assassination.  I don't find these videos to be hysterical because they are grounded on solid facts.  When speculation comes up, it is presented as speculation.   Good explains the ""Deep State"" much better than anyone else has.

Richard Wolff is also a great resource.  His ""[Democracy at Work](https://www.youtube.com/@democracyatwrk/videos)"" channel is excellent.

Anyway, ""collapse"" isn't going to happen.  But decline is inevitable.

The Oligarchy in charge can't figure out how to stop it.

Naw were fine . Building back better. We did it .
Unless the US government eliminates debt, we are for a rough 2-3 years!
It's all about at what point will people snap. Unfortunately, using other countries as an example, as long as it's done slowly people will dig through and eat trash before they will pick up a stick/gun
A slow burn is more likely than a sudden collapse, IMO.
If you wait long enough the universe ends. Right now things are pretty good.
A: US banking and economy short term. Lots of hype about inflation ended up with a soft landing. A few tech firms had trouble pivoting away from the pandemic advertising bubble had to lay people off, but most firms are thirsty for labor. Labor cost is starting to pan out and AI is 2-3 years from taking away most desk jobs so that will be a fun wall to run headlong into. Housing is still bad and will be until states can regulate municipalities on STRs like VRBO zoning. Counties moving out of the USD is troubling and could cause trade Issues. 

A2: The first thing I see really breaking is office real estate. Retrofitting will cost more than tearing down and doing a full rebuild. City tax revenue on these offices are pretty significant. It will be very interesting to see what form federal assistance will take if any.

B: mid term global 10 year outlook : ai will start moving people out of desk jobs soon. You can either do labor, art or ownership and only one makes real money. Starship Superheavy is going to make the cost of going to space plummet in ~5 years. If Russia and China don’t nuke everything over dumb territory disputes, they should recover well.  I wouldn’t buy Oceanside property if I were you.

C: long term: we have all seen the flood map. Assume it’s 10% worse than that. Assume every major coastal port needs to be fully rebuilt every 4 years from 2030-2060. Assume boats will have difficulty navigating residential neighborhoods and shallow waters. Assume we poisoned the land enough that once it floods, what lives there won’t be edible. Assume it’s hot, and that potable water is scarce. 

C2:Even if we stop using oil and coal right now, we have already done this amount of damage
I imagine it’s all about timing. Blowback from today’s activities gonna stack on top of blowback from yesterdays activities, and the day before that. Eventually the feedback loop will probably blow it up
I don't know which is worse, our 'coolest' summer this year or multi-region crop failures very soon. 2024 looks to be shaping up to be a hellscape. The Nostradamus prophesies are playing out to be true. Enjoy life while you can, sensibly.
The rug was already pulled with interest rates raising. The things will unravel following this.
We are so fucked the last chapter will surprise even the flat earthers
I've read a lot about collapse and after several years, I've come to disbelieve that human society will collapse.

> Was wondering if somebody could point me to resources to better educate myself on just how fucked we are

Short term..... we might be a *little* fucked.  There are some serious issues with the sustainability of the national debt and demographics.  We're also undergoing an energy transition away from fossil fuels to more sustainable sources of energy.  These things will require fundamentally restructuring society in ways that challenge vested interests, and will lead to conflicts and recessions.

However, this is no different from any period in human history.  This is no different from 1794, or 1848, or 1919.  Humanity survived those periods and only improved, and I think it is likely that trend will continue.  Why do I say that?

**1)**  The resources exist to allow humanity to last for many centuries in its present condition.  [With uranium and thorium alone we could power humanity for roughly 1000 years](https://whatisnuclear.com/nuclear-sustainability.html).  Likewise (and you can google this) the amount of energy the Earth receives from the sun every hour equals the amount humanity uses in an **entire year**.  And we have the technological capacity to access that energy with wind and solar.

Many countries get a lot of their energy from nuclear.  France gets almost all of its electricity from nuclear power.  Sweden gets 40% of its energy from nuclear power.  And renewable energy is going parabolic in many countries.  So the energy to power civilization is there, it's just a matter of building new infrastructure to collect it and systems to distribute it.  Which again goes back to what I said about restructuring society.

**2)**  Climate change is simply not an existential threat to humanity as a whole.  It will damage parts of the world badly and reduce economic growth.  But even with climate change, the overall impact is slower economic growth, not no growth or negative growth.  

There are studies on the impact of climate change on economic growth.  [They find that climate change will lead to a 10-20% reduction in economic growth by 2100.](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-global-economic-costs-from-climate-change-may-be-worse-than-expected/)  But this reduction in growth is relative to **what would have been in 2100** without climate change.  So if we would have been twice as rich in 2100 without climate change, we would be only be 80% as rich with climate change.  To quote the report I linked to above:

> To understand what climate change might bring in the future, we combined these historical estimates with projections of how much temperature might change by 2100. We found that under a business-as-usual warming scenario, the global economy could be more than 20 percent smaller by 2100 than it would have been had temperatures remained fixed at today’s levels. This does not mean that the world will be poorer in 2100. It almost certainly will not, as there are other factors that will cause economies to grow. Instead, it means that the world will be substantially less rich than it would have been had temperatures not warmed

And even then, it's worth pointing that colder parts of the world will actually benefit from climate change.  And it's [also worth pointing out that the world is adding on renewables on a massive rate](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Environment/Climate-Change/Renewable-energy-capacity-on-track-to-rival-fossil-fuels-in-2024), which will makes a worst case scenario less likely. 

So in short, climate change is not a show stopper for human civilization.  Damaging yes, but something resembling our society will 100% survive.

**3)**  The alternative to collapse isn't futurism.  The future will never be perfect and you will never live in a world like star trek or the jetsons.  [The more mature perspective is something called **longtermism**.](https://ourworldindata.org/the-future-is-vast)  

We are at the early beginning of human history and the majority of the human population has not been born yet.  As such, it makes sense that most of our religious, philosophical, and political systems are flawed and incomplete.  This doesn't mean ALL new alternatives to them will be better, because new systems have to prove themselves first, and old systems have centuries of testing behind them.  But it does mean the best, most optimal systems or versions of our current system, probably lie in the future.
I thought this was a satire post, lol. 
We are possibly at the start of next economic boom. wtf.
Go to pornhub, page 3 video 6.  We are precisely that fucked
Depends on your definition of ""we"".

Look at the Presidents since 2000: Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden

They're all doing ""just fine"".  I'd say of this list that Trump has the greatest affinity with the American Working Class.  And that is abysmal.

I'm ""not fucked"".  Sorry about so many of the rest of you.
We, America, continue to be saved from total disaster due to our amazing ability to technologically leap to the next revolution. We're still doing that, and things will still be fine.
I'd like to point out that even if the ""only"" problem well face is the environmental one, the other two will happen too just because of that. The other two will happen on their own due to systemic problems inherent in them which will probably come to a head soonish but because they all are tied to the others they'll amplify eachother, which makes it the perfect storm.
Also,'Overshoot' by Catton. It is a feature of civilizations to r/collapse, not some exception. Ours is one of many who thought theirs was the greatest. Professor Guy McPherson says we will all be mostly gone by 2026. I lost count of the amount of feedback loops that they keep discovering. There are no techno-fixes and it is irreversible. 

Cheers
This book was published in 1972, coincidentally the year after we went off the gold standard. There’s a lot of parallels there, and the perfect storm could be reversed by moving to a money that isn’t predicated on infinite growth on a finite planet.
However: The causes of collapse this time are not going to reverse themselves after some land reforms, overthrowing a couple of governments, or rebuilding our infrastructure after the bombs have stopped falling…  The environmental impacts will be with us for a very very long time.
That's the world depicted in the film Idiocracy
>Imagine what happens when in the future no one knows how to grow food, purify water, repair a generator, or perform an appendectomy.  That’s our future.

Yet we are simply a YouTube video away from knowing how to do any of that. We’ve come a long way even in the last 20 years or so, what makes you think that reverses? Humans not learning or building? Has there really been a time in our history where that has been the case? Why is right now when we’re the most technologically advanced as we are any different?

I don't think these are the holy grails people hope them to be in the future either. A solar farm is nice and all but the grid can't handle it (at least here in Europe, but the us isn't know for it's top notch grid either). Too much is being generated at peak moments for the grid to handle so they'll cut you off when you're at peak production so the grid doesn't melt down. This will be more common going forward, especially once new solar comes online.

Agriculture is in a pickle too due to a variety of reasons. There's droughts more or less every year, more diseases of crops and more extreme weather events which can decimate crops. There's a lot of oil input in agriculture too which is needed to keep producing the amount we need.

I don't think there is any more room to grow.
I work in residential, fixing old properties for landlords and the rich. I’d eventually like to buy some real estate that can produce a cash flow for me (duplex) and hopefully use the equity years down the line to do more of the same. 


I really hope I have a shot at this still, I’m a year or 2 out from being able to afford it, and in the mean time I’m wondering if I should just scrap my ideals and run for the hills. 


Looking at spending a decent chunk of change to get some equipment to make more money so I can get to my goals faster, don’t even know if it’s worth it.
You’re correct, but eventually it will happen
My parents are farmers. I just hope I can get to their house if shtf
Are you maybe confusing the Thiel video with this one by Ray Diallo? https://youtu.be/xguam0TKMw8
thanks for the link, nice doom page and seems to post almost daily. I'm wondering why /r/economicCollapse didn't grow over time. Remember coming here 5 years ago when it was all just a theory...
What about Great Lakes region? Will that flood the way the oceans will?
I remember reading a bit about Nostradamus when I was way younger, can’t remember much, what are his prophecies for the foreseeable future?
Will interest rates ever go back to normal?
The real dilemma is not the ""If"" but the ""When"".
> There are no techno-fixes and it is irreversible.

Agreed, but once again not the ""if"" but the ""when"". I think a realistic timeline imho would be 2030-2035.
Then why hasn’t the human civilization not yet collapsed? What is preventing us from being a Type 1 or better civilization?  You say that there’s no techno-fix, yet we are absolutely capable of becoming a Type 1 civilization. I have a theory on how we reach that, but it won’t be happening for a few decades
Not sure what you're referring to here?
Also in that movie everyone wore crocs…… 😨
Yes.  In Ancient Rome, the slaves did more and more of the work.  Why repair an aqueduct when a slave can be made to do it?  Why plant crops and tend the crops when a slave can do it?  Both slaves and owners became dull unthinking brutes.

Look at South Africa today: the electricity is on 6 hours per day.  The people who knew how to make potable water are gone.  The roads are falling apart because no one knows how to repair the roads.  The structure is running on autopilot.

Societies work best when intellect is rewarded, or we wind up with collapsing societies (kind of like today).
Sorry about that lol
Don't do Kazakhstan dirty like that
Don’t become a landlord.

Literally anything would be better.
I honestly think that ship has sailed. With interest rates and housing so high, I imagine it will take a long time to pay off the principle before you could even consider renting it out. Unless you are putting a large amount down, I don’t think banking off of peoples living is the way to grown wealth anymore.
As long as you produce an improved level of real value from that investment then I say go for it. 

It has to be rational as in the ratio of money in matches the ratio of improved productivity. Eventually you run into things like the law of diminishing returns.

yes i was
Normal as in 10%+ or the new *normal* 0% ?
We are actually in a stage of descent. People are dying from heat and we just saw the hottest temperatures 4 days in a row. This is just one of many symptoms of Overshoot, characterized by too few land, resources, energy for the existing population with insatiable appetites. One all the ice melts, guess where that thermal energy goes to. The El Niño phenomenon has set ourselves up for a real whopper. It only gets hotter from here with more floods, fires, drought, and mayhem. Many tipping points have already been triggered, which makes things worse. I wish this boat was not sinking.
>Yes.  In Ancient Rome, the slaves did more and more of the work.  Why repair an aqueduct when a slave can be made to do it?  Why plant crops and tend the crops when a slave can do it?  Both slaves and owners became dull unthinking brutes.

We still advanced as a species so I don’t get the argument.

>Look at South Africa today: the electricity is on 6 hours per day.  The people who knew how to make potable water are gone.  The roads are falling apart because no one knows how to repair the roads.  The structure is running on autopilot.

There’s states in the US that still go through rolling brownouts and blackouts today during extreme conditions. It’s not because no one knows how to fix it, we just simply don’t have the will or incentive to do so. As long as Wall Street is going up, nobody really cares. 

>Societies work best when intellect is rewarded, or we wind up with collapsing societies (kind of like today).

I agree somewhat. I think the main issue nowadays is less critical thinking and less responsibility taking to learn and grow from mistakes.
“ Load shedding is the now-routine practise of scheduling power cuts to keep the country's power grid from collapsing. South Africans have become used to load shedding for over 15 years. However in the 2020s, the government has had to resort to progressively higher stages, leaving households without electricity for up to half a day at a time.   
Locals like Dlamini are worried that in the coming colder months the power cuts could get worse, with the government now proposing a load shedding schedule with up to 16 stages — meaning the lights would only stay on a few hours a day. “

Why?
I’m not here to argue your points are wrong, but I do think it’s a waste of time  focusing on all the problems. What are the solutions? Where do the problems stem from? 

Imo it starts and ends with the money. There isn’t too few land, resources, and energy. It just seems that way because the money is infinite, it makes everything else scarce. The insatiable appetite? It’s a product on an inflationary money fueled by debt. We measure “growth” as GDP (goods/services that are produced/sold), basically consumerism. Our economy runs on consumerism and the financialization of that consumerism to try and grow infinitely on a finite world. 

The currency we have today literally puts people on a hamster wheel till they retire or die. How do things only get more expensive? How are we not working less with all the technological gains we’ve had? Imagine how much less you’d do out of convenience even if you were able to work 20 hours instead of 40(+)? Imagine if we could get back to only a single worker household? 

Fixing the money would fix the “growth” model which would fix much of the problems of the world.
Societies collapse for a variety of reasons but those are often rooted in lack of intellect.  Historically, rulers punished Innovation because they were happy with the status quo.  Religious authorities despised thinking and promoted faith, to keep their power.

We face the same thing today: humanity is becoming more stupid.  Even Flynn (of Flynn Effect fame) has said IQs are dropping all around the world.  Highly intelligent people have fewer and fewer children, while there’s fewer disincentives for lower IQ people to have lots of kids.  Why worry when there’s EBT, SS disability, section 8 housing, and welfare checks for having lots of kids?

One day, there’s no more money for all the free stuff.  Then, just like Rome in 450 AD, dissolution and destitution follow.
in addition to the other response below, it's just a historically shit way to make money. 

it is the definition of ""rent seeking"" behavior. the whole premise is to leech off the income of others in exchange for simply a place to live. 

and this whole notion of ""passive income"" is a huge lie. talk to anyone who ""manages"" properties — there's nothing passive about it. this is all assuming you have good tenants and not headaches. 

and good luck to your wallet and soul when the time comes to evict someone. i know someone who recently had to toss a single mother out on the street. are you ready to do that? you are the decision point as to whether another human becomes homeless. is that how you want to look for profit? 

housing, like healthcare, is something that should be detached from the profit motive.
If you do better have an iron clad lease and also in an area where it’s known not to have issues with tenants. The town I live In is horrible if you are a land lord. People don’t pay and destroy rentals, and nothing happens. 10 minutes from me the situation is completely different. I know people that have done what you want to do and said never again. They have bought in my town. I have a friend who is a landlord here and other places and his big issues are our town. If you do it do background checks and vet. And don’t feel sorry for people, that is always when he gets screwed, the people that give these sob stories are the ones that end up giving him the hardest time.
>Societies collapse for a variety of reasons but those are often rooted in lack of intellect.  Historically, rulers punished Innovation because they were happy with the status quo.  Religious authorities despised thinking and promoted faith, to keep their power.

Very much agree. We’re actually seeing it now with AI and the regulatory moat some want to build around it instead of just allowing the open sourcing of it.

I could see this all becoming true if we continue on the path of inflationary money. We don’t even know the true cost of anything as prices are manipulated higher and higher over time. What happens when technology replaces every job in that scenario?
I know there is nothing passive about it, thus me working in residential. I want to work on my own properties. 


Also, I am not a leftist, I could really give a shit if I’m making money off of people living in my space. It’s a fact of life, I’d rather be on the money making side of things.
communist bs 🙄
>I am not a leftist, I could really give a shit if I’m making money off of people

I didn't say anything about being a leftist. 

Just, you know. All things being equal, probably better to not be a bad person.
Spoken like somebody who's never left the comfort and privilege of a capitalist country, or knows nothing of history, at all. 

As someone who's parents lived through the utopia of government housing in a former soviet state, please stop. Just stop.

Paying for housing is not immoral or wrong.
Paying rent is a fact of life. The alternative, government funded housing, could be much worse, especially in the us of a where everything that is government funded usually goes to shit and has budget cuts. 


Rather live somewhere the landlord lives, who knows how to fix anything that could possibly go wrong in the house, and will be on it if/when it actually does go wrong, doesn’t charge an exorbitant amount for rent, and generally doesn’t snoop/doesn’t snitch for weed smoke/minds his own business as long as you, ya know, pay your bills on time. 

It’s just the basic facts of life.
""because one time a thing was once anecdotally bad it is impossible for that thing to ever be improved on and the alternative is always good and never bad""

got it.
The sheer scale of the failure of communal housing (Millions of people here), that is completely lost on you, should be a warning to all. Don't listen to this propaganda AKA - ""TheY JUst DiDt DO iT corRectly""

Millions of people over decades is a ""one time thing""????

Why is it that people who didn't come from communal housing love it so much, yet the ones who lived it in real life are willing to give up their lives to escape it?

EDIT: Forgot youtube links get you banned here. Just simply google it.
… What about the sheer scale of the failure of for-profit housing?

The plight of millions of impoverished and homeless people is completely lost on you, and should be a warning to all.
This is the propaganda. Even ""terrible"" housing in the west is 10x better than communal housing.

Water rationing (Or simply no water at all), lines for a bathroom, violent roommates you can't remove, organized housing gangs that demand extra rent for ""protection"", etc, etc."
Guy explains how everything we purchase winds up profiting a handful of megacorporations,52,https://v.redd.it/9wqvupcnge5b1,"They are the new aristocracy and we are the serfs.  All they did was change the names.
Blackrock and Vanguard are investment companies, they don’t run the companies he listed. They take their customers money and invest it for them as a service, including a lot of regular working people who invest portions of their income for retirement or w/e. Those numbers represent a collective of people all investing together under a particular firm. If this guy thinks blackrock runs American because of those holdings he’s an idiot.
This is very misleading. Vanguard and Blackrock manage mutual funds and ETF, which people like you or me can own.
yep!
And called it capitalism instead of feudalism. And told us we're free. So we stop complaining about not being free.
well if they own much of america might they also run it?
i'm r/homeless
That is true, however if anything that makes it even worse. Vanguard and Blackrock get huge voting powers at all of those companies. Say you invest all your 401(k) money in vanguard. Do you get a vote or representation in those investments? No. These companies get tremendous voting power using other people's money.
No, they represent people and invest for them. Blackrock or vanguards total stake into a company represents the collective investments of thousands of people. They just take a small fee. If your ever feeling optimistic about the economy you can give your money to these companies and for a surprisingly small fee they will invest it and give you yearly earnings or you can let it compound for retirement

Okay the vast majority of Americans are not homeless and many have money in these index funds. Which means they collectively own a portion of these companies the video is claiming Vanguard and Blackrock control.
the american empire is breaking up.

investing in the future is a scam.
that makes them part this.

remember enron
No, it does not. Look I get your homeless and all, but that doesn't excuse ignorance. You can buy Vanguard or Blackrock index funds and own a slice of Google, Raytheon, or Berkshire Hathaway.
and?

enron was also publicly traded.

enron burned everyone involved with them.

the reason we are descending into the next great depression is corruption.
And? It means the claim the video makes that Vanguard and Blackrock secretly own all of these companies is false. Their customers own them by buying index funds, and those customers can be people like you or me. What happened with Enron is completely irrelevant to the claims made in the video.
i do not trust these companies.
I never said you have to trust them and you it doesn't require trust to know how these companies operate and know this video is false. Using false information to support your argument only makes it look weak, even if it is correct.
what it stopping these people from pulling ""an enron""?
I'm really not sure why you are bringing up Enron. What happened with Enron was they lied to their investors through fraudulent accounting practices. That has nothing to do with what this video is about. This video is claiming that Vanguard and Blackrock control/own most of the world's companies when that is simply not true. Their customers do.
their investors are suckers to trust corporations that have put themselves above the law."
