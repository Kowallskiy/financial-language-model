Finance is the study and discipline of money, currency and capital assets. It is related to, but not synonymous with economics, which is the study of production, distribution, and consumption of money, assets, goods and services (the discipline of financial economics bridges the two).
Finance activities take place in financial systems at various scopes; thus, the field can be roughly divided into personal, corporate, and public finance.[a]

Finance is the study of businesses and investments.

Finance, or The Fascinating Game of Finance or Finance and Fortune, is a board game originally released in 1932. The game is based on The Landlord's Game in the movement of pieces around the board, the use of cards, properties that can be purchased, and houses that can be erected on them. The game also has railroads; however, these may not be purchased. The game is a predecessor to Monopoly.

The Finance Business Daily (Slovene: Poslovni dnevnik Finance; Finance meaning Finances) is the only daily Slovenian business and financial newspaper. The idea to publish it had already been proposed by Iztok Jurančič before 1991, when Slovenia declared its independence. However, it was realized only in 1992. At first, the newspaper was published by the company Gospodarski Vestnik. Today, it is published by the Časnik Finance company, which is owned by the Swedish Bonnier Group and also publishes several other publications; for example, the magazines Manager and Moje finance, the healthcare newspaper Medicina danes, and the web portals Finance and Mojevro.[2] As of 2008, the Finance Business Daily accounted for three quarter of the Časnik Finance company income.[3] Before becoming a daily newspaper in 2002, Finance was issued twice weekly.
