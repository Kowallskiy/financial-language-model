"You hear about the kid who put in $500 into a memecoin and made 100k, but you don't hear about the hundreds who put $1000 and are left with $0.1",53906,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n7rl2y/you_hear_about_the_kid_who_put_in_500_into_a/,"My buddy (who's a successful business person with a few Ms) put 2300 in doge four or five months ago, he just cashed out 1.2m. Meanwhile I'm sitting here poking my LTC with a stick saying ""do something""
You also don‚Äôt hear about me turning my $20 into $21.04 üòé
Survivorship bias is real and it's everywhere
I'm one of those guys who fomo'd in 2017 and ended up half my coins  not even listed in exchanges.    Guys Do your own research and it's fine to take a quick profit just don't get too greedy!
Everybody talks about the Amazon that they thought about  buying but didn't,  but nobody talks about the blockbuster that they were thinking about buying but chose not to.
You also don't hear about the early Bitcoin investors who have already made millions probably because they have better things to do. Most of us are still here posting because we haven't reached our life changing goals yet.
You never hear about people like me that started off with $400 in crypto who now have $500 in crypto
This isnt an reddit post anymore. This is life advice.
Yeah imagine being the one to buy at the top of dogecoin's run üíÄ
The need to ‚ÄúWin more‚Äù (greed) is a weird quirk of humanity. I didn‚Äôt buy into BTC until 28k. I passed on every opportunity when it was $1, $5, $100, etc... because I didn‚Äôt really understand what was happening. I was around when 4chan users were tipping each other in BTC. I sold my BTC at $50k. I could‚Äôve bought in sooner and I could‚Äôve held longer, but I DOUBLED MY INVESTMENT in a very short period of time. That‚Äôs the DREAM in most investments.

Think about a traditional investment. If you make 20% in a year on a stock, that‚Äôs a really amazing stock. Take your profits and move on. Don‚Äôt agonize over how much you could‚Äôve made with a different decision.

I think it‚Äôs because with cryptos, people are investing very small amounts. $50-$100 at a time and expecting $1000 or more in profit. If you put in $100 and get $120 out, you‚Äôve done VERY well compared to almost anything else.
I turned $0.06 into $8.28
I am newish to crypto and i bought 100 into doge and cashed out at $1800 the other day.  Bought myself an electric longboard as a congratulatory present

Survivor bias. 

No one talks about their failures but we always want to repeat the one-in-a-million success.
 **but you don't hear about the \*thousands\* who put $1000 and are left with $0.1**
I turned $500 into $915 in less than 2 days. To some that‚Äôs not much but to me that‚Äôs plenty
Yep, when it is a bull market like now, you have all these fairy tale, positive posts. And then when it‚Äôs a bear market, all these people suddenly disappear.

I lost 5 figures investing into cryptocurrency right after the Jan 2018 mega crash but right before that Fall brought a multi year bear market.

Cryptocurrency isn‚Äôt a safe investment stategy. Some win, many lose. I‚Äôm one of those many losers.
Kinda hard when you see another ‚Äúmeme coin‚Äùshibtoken going up 600% and now at 26 on coinmarketcap. Loads of kids gained hard today.
Exactly the same reason you only hear from a winning gambler.
You also don‚Äôt hear about someone investing $100 in decent coins and getting $1000 return
I used a combination of day trading, swing trading, hype gambling (on doge) and simply buying ADA and staking.

I was able to double my portfolio from about 11k USD to 22k as of the current moment in about 6-7 weeks. 

I probably would have done slightly better just buying Doge 6 weeks ago at $0.08 and holding till now. But i dont think that is ever going to be a reasonable expectation. The rise of doge is a black swan event, and it would be another black swan event if it doesn't collapses back to $0.3-0.5 territory eventually.
You ever hear the story about the guy who raffled a dead horse?

For real, he set up a raffle for a horse for $5 per ticket. Thousands of people bought tickets, the guy was elated. He happily pulled the ticket to select the winner.

When the winner was drawn, the horse seller called him up to have him come meet him at the stable. When the guy got there, the raffle guy showed him the horse. But the horse had been dead for weeks, and was in really bad shape. The raffle guy realized this guy didn't want the dead horse so he gave him his $5 back. 

Legend says he laughed all the way to the bank with his $25,000 cash.

Moral of the story, dont bet on a dead fuckin horse!
I wish i read this few hours coz i can't liquidate 10$ worth of shiba coin xd
DOGE has over 30Billion in 24h trading volume and it hasn't even pumped today. That's quite a bit of liquidity.
Or those whom had Doge act as their crypto gateway drug; doubled their money, did research, and have now pulled out 75% and put it into Ether and have their home PC now setup as a mining rig.

I suspect Doge will act as a entry point for alot of folks new to crypto. Stay positive!
[deleted]
I bought 80$ of Doge when it was .0025 a coin I cashed out whet it was about .60 a coin I now have over 19k in my bank I didn‚Äôt have before seems pretty liquid to me.
Honestly nobody knows. I thought doge was a fun coin to buy so I bought like 50 bucks for funsies, that netted me about 20k. But my god the regret that I potentially couldn't tossed in a couple of 1000s, for a million coins. I would've been able to buy a house right now. But it is what it is. I used the profits and reinvested in the top three cryptocurrencies. Thanks Doge Family and Elon.
You'll hear about it lol, just nobody remembers.

WSB was nothing but sad bagholder posts for weeks after GME took a nosedive.
actually I read it all the time here
I was so scared of turning that 1k in .01 that I didn't invest in dogecoin 3 months ago... and I didn't invest in gme at $43 cause I was sure it was going to crash the next day. Fuckkkkkk, I could have bought a house
I once turned $500 into $800 then into $200, you don't hear about me
Yes and that‚Äôs why I only invest what I can afford to lose.
But when do I sell üò≠ I didnt put much in, but it is a lot now so idk when to sell because I want to make more but we don't know when it will crash üò≠
If anyone wants to know. I put $1000 in Spankchain in 2017 and was left with less than $0.1, because it went down 95% and then Cryptopia shut down.
My friend put 1500 into Shiba Inu and now it's worth 30k and he tried to post about here because I told him to and he got his post deleted and then banned. Soo you don't hear about whatever the mods here don't want ya to hear about, and a lot of those failure stories are prob weeded out by them honest guys controlling the sub
Sir this is a casino
Some college kid in wallstreetbets turned $10k into $10 million within 2 years of yoloing on meme stocks. But look at the loss porn there. Just because someone made it, doesn't mean everyone can make it.
I originally got into crypto with Doge. The more people learn about crypto, as I did, the more you‚Äôll have people jumping out of these over-hyped coins. 

Yeah, I wish I could of made 100K of Doge, but real sustainable crypto that will survive for the long-term is what I am all about now.
I‚Äôll take that risk. My other option of working a 9-5 and slowly investing into an IRA until 65 isn‚Äôt much better. 

Youtubers, digital nomads, social media influencers, entrepreneurs, etc. all had to take a risk or gamble, this is the risk I‚Äôm willing to take.

I‚Äôm not a big or even smart investor but I will always live by ‚ÄúNever invest what you are not okay losing‚Äù if you invested $1000 and came away with $0.01, that shouldn‚Äôt phase you. You should of said goodbye to that $1000 as soon as you bought the crypto. People yeet their retirement and/or kid‚Äôs college funds into stock or crypto and are devastated when they lose it all, yeah dip shit, that‚Äôs the other side of gambling and that‚Äôs all this shit is
[deleted]
Thanks, I needed to read this.  
I had to dump all of my Dogecoin at a loss to cover things after my Husband got into a wreck in his truck then lost his job.  
I'm feel'n this survivorship bias strong.  I keep beating myself up on not waiting a while, to sell but I have to remember there was no way to know. Bills were more important at the time.
Yeah
We get it, /r/cryptocurrency hates dogecoin. Do we really need these posts 10 times a day?
Nobody has lost money on this ‚Äúmemecoin‚Äù unless they sold too early.
I‚Äôm one of those who mined doge when it first came out. Forgot about it. And now are digging through files on old computers cause I have no idea how much I had.
Survivorship bias, the foundation of the American dream. How many LeBron Jameses did not make it to pro bball and will die poor?
I've turned a few hundred bucks worth of Bitcoin Into cocaine and mdma

Lol doge made me 5k from 500
History is written by the winners. Never forget this. You want to spread your story of success, not the multiple times you lost.
Doge is gonna create a new generation of bagholders
$1000 to $0.01 seems like good gains.... right guys?... ^right?...
Im up $0.1. God is by my side
NEVER invest what you can't afford to lose. That's just gambling.
That's where did this kid's 100k come from. Wharever you earn is from someone else pocket
You always have to remember there is absolutely no value generated here besides fees for exchanges. Any gain is just somebody else's money.
You don‚Äôt hear about me turning $500 into $550 and cashing out only to see the price go up another 25%
Remember the phenomenon 90/90/90, especially with trading platforms and brokers

90% of all new investors will lose 90% of their money within 90 days
Crypto and stocks are simply crap this week when compared to last week. It‚Äôs not just that particular ‚Äúmemecoin‚Äù. So it isn‚Äôt over until it‚Äôs over. So damn depressing though. I see it as buy time. Discounts across the board.
As someone who turned a 4 digit investment in a ""meme"" coin into a 6 figure amount. **The important thing is being able to tell the difference between a community driven crypto, and a meme coin.** Doge is community driven. Hoge is community driven. Safemoon is community driven. A community driven coin is going to make you fucking rich. A memecoin with a small shill-based community is going to pump and dump and make you sad.

This subreddit as a whole has an irrational bias against meme coins. Do not be like them. Nobody puts their favorite water or electricity company logo as their facebook avatar. They put their favorite sports mascot. Community crypto will not be going anywhere, ever. Utility coins can die overnight when their utility is rendered obsolete by newer tech.

Do not invest in meme coins. Invest in community driven coins. They look alike, but there is a huge difference. This is the ""DYOR"" factor on ""meme"" coins, investigate the community surrounding it.
All it takes is brass balls and spreading them on every coin within your financial means. Then you wait. Anyone can win in this bull market. This is ultimately technology, so lets draw an analogy to ‚Äò01 tech bubble. Crypto is like tech back in 1995, still in it‚Äôs infancy. So much growth ahead. Institutional investors are in. It‚Äôs insulated.

TLDR; This isn‚Äôt a gamble, its a guarantee. Hodl, and you shall see.

![gif](giphy|Qs75BqLW44RrP0x6qL)
I hate how meme coins are literally defeating the purpose of crypto currency. These ‚Äúpump and dumps‚Äù are all ridiculous.
I feel like this doesn‚Äôt need to be said, except for maybe people who haven‚Äôt traded often or are new. It‚Äôs common sense to know that there is risk in anything that holds value as one day it may not. You‚Äôre pretty fucking stupid if you invest more than what you can reasonably lose. If you don‚Äôt know this by now, only invest what you‚Äôre willing to lose. That being said, hold, even if it‚Äôs for years until you reach an amount where you don‚Äôt have to lose. This shits essentially a game and you just have to get lucky or know how to play it.
The ones who went through 2017 learned the hard way! ICO pump and dumps &  BITCONNNNECT..... 

So will the 2021 crowd have to learn the hard way. The DOGE pump and dump will be the most epic pump and dump I have ever seen.
The only people that have lost money on DOGE are the ones that cashed out in a dip. Someone making a bad decision isn't the currencies fault its the person choosing to treat an investment like a casino gamble. Why would anyone want to hear about the guy that did it wrong when they can hear about the kid that kept his cool and didn't panic sell.
... or the times coins drop by up to 5% every single time I buy. I'm pretty good at losing $5-50 within hours on every crypto or stock buy. Ask me how!
Go to TripAdvisor and read Vegas trip reports, it‚Äôs amazing how much money everyone on that website wins. It‚Äôs almost like some of them (most) are lying.
Why so much FUD lately on the crypto boards?
 who is that? cause most of us got in under $.10 so its alllllllllllll profit. and when its as a stock despite all the crankiness about the trading companies and crypto, you can liquidate 24/7 boom boom boom. 

but yes this was for shits and giggles my husband refused it in his trading account so dont be a dummy about it. I spent a weeks worth of mobile gaming once and am up 2k in 7 weeks im not upset
Maybe if your hands were made of rice paper you'd know

Ya only lose money when you sell
Imagine having sympathy for people loosing at gamblingü§£
You gotta use the memecoin as a infinity money glitch. Pull at the right time.
Is there an actual subreddit that discusses crypto instead of these moon farming feel good bullshit posts?  Jesus christ scrolling through this garbage is pointless.  Where is the actual content and discussion?
We heard all about it when bitconnect tanked.  That‚Äôs all we heard about. Every day for weeks.  These people ignored warning after warning and they got burned.
I had 100k Dogecoins. I sold them all to fail at trying to turn a couple hundred bucks into a few thousand on Robin Hood. You didn't hear about that. And how I would have 70k right now.
It‚Äôs like people who gamble. They will tell you how much they win one time but don‚Äôt about the other ten times they lost all their money ü§∑
And you haven't heard about how I turned 4000 into 400 in one week by day trading either. It's an epic tale of determination and survival.
Why the fuck are these people putting money into coins that have no volume anyway.  Sounds more like these people have no idea on the basic numbers to look at.

I keep putting 500 in and and then slowly losing till I sell low and buy something else only to find out it was at its peak and it starts dropping too so I sell and rebuy what I had before but slightly lower and then it drops again‚Ä¶basically I‚Äôm the guy who switches into the fast lane only for it to slow down and then the lane I was in speeds up. Just with money.
LiteCoin did me in 2017. Lost 80% of my total crypto investments while I was sleeping the night. #FCKCharlieLee
Back in 2011/12 I brought 4 bitcoin for ¬£12 each. I had recently heard about this new currency and figured I would see if they would ever increase enough so I could cash them later. 

Stored them in an offline wallet on my laptop, and backed it up on a USB drive.

Anyway, I ended up forgetting about them until just before Xmas just gone. Looked up the price and thought holy shit, I got money... go me.

Then I remembered that the hard drive I had the wallet on died about 2 years ago. Fuck.... Wait a minute, I got the usb backup. Go me.....

So I find the usb drive, plug it in, and my heart sinks. 

At some point over the years I obviously forgot what this drive had on it as it had a load of random files for work, spreadsheets, documents etc. But no wallet file. I must have formatted it. I tried everything I could to recover the file but it was gone.

I still have the dead hard drive, somewhere. Who knows, one day I might even work out which drive it was (I have many old dead drives). Then I can sit and look at it and imagine what life could have been like if wasn't so stupid to create just one more backup.

Or I might just frame it, titled ""My greatest mistake""

I still have one Casascius physical bitcoin 1btc that is unredeemed, but I refuse to redeem that as i promised it to my son when he turns 18.

I turned $300 into $170.
I had 13,870,000 dogecoin. Had. I slap myself everyday

i turned 600 dollars into 50 bucks

watching youtube videos.

it still hurts. makes you want to give up.
I can show you how to turn 10k to $10
I lucked out a bit with ETC the other day. I bought $25 worth awhile back and it spiked the other day; I made over $1000 off a $25 investment.
The key is to get in early when the price is low. I bought Doge when it was .003. My investment was less than $1k and I made $27k so far. I‚Äôm still holding some.

I also invested in Safemoon when it was .0000008. I‚Äôm up $24k on Safemoon so far.
Guess what? This is going to surprise a lot of you. Children are always in tune when they are young, they know things straight up differently than adults because they don‚Äôt have bias and that‚Äôs a gold thing, they can see things for what they are. That being said, the reason the kids ‚Äúwon‚Äù is because they didn‚Äôt randomly throw 100 in a coin and forget about it a bunch of these kids are finding out that communities are what make a coin survive. If you‚Äôre just picking each and every meme coin you can find then you‚Äôre playing odds slightly better than that at the casino. Find yourself a project where the developers are transparent, they have goals, they have liquidity ideas early on, and new tokenomics. The next coins to pop fully will be those with primo tokenomics paving the way for crypto. Think about it. We don‚Äôt want centralization. We already have Wall Street being whales and manipulating prices. The tokens which do these transaction fees correctly, allow the buyers to be protected by whale proof code, and those that have a dev team / community oriented meetings will be those to survive. Also if you‚Äôre down, please do not sell. Lol. The entire market is only psychological movements.  Do yourself a favor and change your red and green colors on your chart to something like white. Also if you‚Äôre investing and not trading, stop looking at the chart you have no idea what you‚Äôre doing
I bought VET last year at .004¬¢ racked up almost 55000 and now even with the dip I am up more than a thousand percent. Luck is one thing but investing in solid companies usually pays way better in the long run. I didn‚Äôt buy Doge then and not buying it now. It‚Äôs not impacting the monetary system like cryptocurrency is supposed to.
>Survivorship bias is a dangerous thing.

This subreddit is peak survivorship, if anyone takes financial advice from this sub, you‚Äôre 100% fucked financially. God the amount unintentional ironic circle jerking you guys do is next level cringe.
just say you missed out on the hype train of the ‚Äúmeme coins‚Äùüêï and now your taking out your anger on this reddit post and move on
A Ponzi scheme has winners, but most that participate....
$1,000 isn‚Äôt a lot. Losing $1,000 isn‚Äôt a big deal when you have the chance to 200x your money. Risk/reward. The risk is well worth it.
That's true, but you also don't hear about people who made millions, because they have better things to do
Probably because if they say say anything, the usual redditers will just descend and do their normal insulting.
I always miss out on beating myself up.
Exactly this. Good work
That‚Äôs the stock market, money is not made, just transferred. Someone must hold a bag for someone to take a bag. It‚Äôs not just crypto.
Yeah? Maybe bc that doesn‚Äôt happen. Show me all these memecoins that dropped 100,000%
Can someone expand on the last point? That meme coins are far less liquid? Does this mean that you couldn‚Äôt withdraw your funds as soon as you wanted to? (disclaimer: i‚Äôm not a doge pumper. Just a curious newcomer).
Can confirm my friend put $8000 USD in crypto which is now worth $2000000 (yes thats 2 million dollars). I put $3000 in crypto which is now $300 after 3-4 years
Just buy bitcoin and move on lol
People will always be left holding the bag. That‚Äôs the way this game works

You are full of truth my friend. Think 3 times before investing and also do your research.

I bought DOGE when it was $0.1**
Winning is loud - losing is quiet.
Don‚Äôt invest more than you can afford to lose, and don‚Äôt be ashamed to take your initial investment once you make profits.
Crypto is zero sum. Literally all the money in the system comes from people buying the coins. If you think the pyramid will continue expanding, you're fine. Otherwise you're at the base of the pyramid and there's no one to buy your coins above what you paid.
You also did not hear about me being not able to withdraw my Electroneum because of the KYC
To be fair, you hear about the people who lost everything non-stop on this sub. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Wait you cant sell DOGE for cash?
If investing were easy, everyone would be doing it.  

When investing, either become a due diligence god, or show up to the party late and leave early when a huge boom shows up.

Most people are very happy with double-digit gains in the course of a year.  Doubling your money in the first half of 2021 via these coins or GME is a fantasy previous generations never even dreamed of - it never happened to regular people.

Don't invest what you can't afford to lose, and remember that once everyone knows about which train to get on, it often slows down rapidly.
So what I hear is: ‚Äúput some lunch money in and not your entire savings and you‚Äôll be fine‚Äù.

Hell, you might actually end up being able to make a profit to buy more Ether/bit.
I turned $225 into $265! Go meeeeeee
There is a psychological effect called ‚Äúregret avoidance‚Äù which is highly prevalent  in crypto and other high risk investments that makes it really hard for people to cash out. People would rather ride until they‚Äôre broke than cash out and take a massive profit because they fear the regret of cashing out too early.

For those with RSUs, this is a serious trap. RSUs are a cash bonus the company automatically converts into stock for you. It takes one button push to get the cash back. Almost nobody would invest an entire cash bonus in company stock in one shot but somehow the regret avoidance keeps them from pushing the button to get the cash. 

Sell them as soon as they invest and put the money in the broad market. You are crazy to have your savings and your job fully invested in one single company.

One time I turned 24k Into 9k with Refinable ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Yes, I‚Äôm trying very hard ***not*** to hear about them. Thank you very much!
> but you don't hear about the hundreds who put $1000 and are left with $0.1

When did that happen? Never? Is that what we don't hear about it?
I turned $10 to $100 and I‚Äôm pretty proud of myself.
I mean, generally if you bought crypto a year or more ago, you've made money. Where most people shoot themselves in the foot is trying to swing/macro trade and selling their profitable holdings to chase pumps.
One of the dumbest things I constantly hear is ""I don't care if I lose it all, I'm holding."" Why would you not care? I would much rather have $1000 than zero. I'd rather have $20 than $0. Being able to afford losing it is different than not caring if you lose it. You should care, and you should be doing everything in your power to make money.

Quit being stupid thinking it's getting rich or going bust. This does not have to be a lottery ticket. There are an infinite number of options between broke and rich, and aiming for anything other than broke should be the goal. Too many people are relying on one pick to set them up for life, when the vast majority of winners got there by making lots and lots of picks over years and decades.
I put some money into Bitcoin in January and deleted the app I used - thinking I‚Äôd withdrawn everything. 

Opened it up today and saw I had ¬£160 worth of Bitcoin üí™

I went from 160k to 40k the day robinhood locked us out of selling gme. It happens everywhere.

It‚Äôs risk. Know about it
You don't hear about him because he didn't have money to pay his internet bills
During the height of the GameStop stuff, it was hard to get this across. The implication was that you were out to get the little guy, when the opposite was true.
Checking in
I was skeptical of doge for months and finally felt I had enough confirmation of bullish momentum last week. I made 1k last week while working my job and riding the wave. Today I put half back in to make a potential 250-500 more, but cutting loss if it dips to 55 cents to limit my loss and planning to sell at 80 if it runs up. The most important thing to remember about investing is that any positive profit is a success. It doesn't have to be a million dollars. Always plan a realistic strategy for realistic returns and an exit limit if it falls below your risk threshold. This is not a movement or some moral quest. It is a money making strategy and that is all. That being said, #DogeCoinToTheMoon! #HodlTheLine!
Meh, I put 400 into doge this weekend because musk is gonna be on SNL and I expect him to pump it. It‚Äôs all profits I‚Äôve made, so I‚Äôm not worried about it. Put some other dollar into ADA and then some rando > dollar coins, they go up a little I make a lot, they go dont a lot I loose a little. Don‚Äôt play with money you can‚Äôt afford to lose and you always win

I‚Äôve turned $100 into $500 üòé
Thank you for putting this out there. I bought 323,058 (approximately $1000) dogecoin in early December and sold them after after I made  $250. I feel like I am being kicked in the ass everytime I hear the latest milestone it crosses and instantly do the math and feel sick to my stomach. So, thank you for putting this out there, it makes me feel less alone.
Welcome to investing. It‚Äôs all a risk and nothing is guaranteed.
I mean anytime you put money into the market or try to invest, there's a chance of loss. I put $300 into a memecoin early on and it's now about 6K. I've also lost on a couple things and one time blew $200 at the slot machines in Vegas. It's all risk and reward baby!
On november 20th, i had 5‚Ç¨ left in my coinbase wallet. Just for fun i bought ETH at 444‚Ç¨, with a .99 fee. So i had 4.01‚Ç¨ in ETH. Currently 28,91‚Ç¨ stonks.
Most of these coins won't even stand a chance in the next couple of years. Another Bitconnect situation is bound to happen.
That's the fact, crypto is becoming mainstream and a lot of people throws money in it. Just because everyone wants more money and is fooled by the social and the posts in it with ""i have become milionare/extra rich with this.."" and so on

Don't spend more than you afford to lose
Once the liquidity in Dogecoin disappears, it's going to be a bloodbath.
To me it's really simple: if a coin has no value and its value comes solely from the hype... eventually it's going to fall down.

If you're taking profit, someone else is getting fucked at somepoint if the coin will turn to shit. I don't want to be a part of that
Lack of liquidity is a thing. Rich on paper, but you can't do anything with it.
Exactly. Same goes with stocks. Everybody wants to brag when they get a 100% return but they don't talk about their losses or overall gain.
That kid was Barack Obama üòé
What are your thoughts on Shiba Inu? I bought some a  about a week ago and my investment did a 13x or so. Id like to keep it and hodl it until it reaches around 1 cent or a little less. But im not sure if its just going to crash hard and slowly die after this weekend. And i should just cash out?
Actually, you do, in the story about the kid, because that's literally exactly how trading works
This is why you only invest what you can afford to lose. Funny how all our 401K's are automatically invested in stocks.
$30 into $28.73 üòé

If you were buying into march 2020 lows and HAVEN'T made at least 100 grand then you're doing something very very wrong.

There is already no skill involved in buying in at bottoms in a market that only has gone up and if you failed to do even that then you're seriously missing something.

The real skill in this market comes down almost entirely to when you exit and actually realize your ""gains"" because the only thing that will be gaining at the end of this cycle will be a negative percentage PNL.
You also don‚Äôt hear about me turning $50 into $49.75
Best to stay away from Meme coins like doge and invest in meaningful projects that are doing something in the crypto space like ETH.
You know what I do hear about? The same posts warning about Dogecoin. We get it.
I had millions of doge from mining in 2014, I had the world's first crypto currency podcast. I have recipts now 20k+ on gambling on dice rolls. I have nothing. Ay one time my robot was 350,000 doge coin from giveaways in the early days
You have been banned from /r/wallstreetbets
What coin went down from $1000 to $0.01?
I bought 200$ of doge at 10 cents. I sold at 30 cents. Then I bought 200$ more of doge every time it hit 20.9 cents and sold 90% of that every time it went above 32 cents. I kept the little 10% that was accumulated each time in a separate wallet.

I made pretty decent money doing that. Not 10,000 dollars. But I made probably 1000 or so? And I still have a solid amount of doge. Like 6000.


Meme coin or not. A simple strategy like this is always going to make money. You can't not make money. If you buy something at 20 cents and sell it at 32 cents, you made money.

I think the idea of ""going all in"" on a meme coin is super ballsy, borderline stupid. Maybe even just plain stupid. 

But setting up a workable strategy and working it is worth while. Doesn't matter if you are selling bottle caps, blowjobs, or doge coins, sell high, buy low, make money.
Can someone elaborate on ""memecoin liquidity""? 

That's genuinely interesting and not something I'd thought about
I put 100 in it turned to 300. I pulled out the hundred and just play with the earnings. The only people that should be investing in meme coin are those that can afford to lose it all. It‚Äôs a major gamble.
I turned $10,000+ into $10
See never wager any more then you are willing to lose. I threw in 50 bucks and I‚Äôm up to 55 now. Even if it were to plummet I‚Äôve lost nothing.
Has that one guy shouting,‚ÄùNFTs!!!‚Äù, turned up yet?
Pro tip: Don‚Äôt use anything you read on this sub as advice. ANYTHING.
Well yeah no one wants to hear about that.
Gambling logic. If people stop and think about it then its an obvious thing. This is very evident over on wallstreetbets.

Ty for the reminder. Only fork out what u can afford
All crypto are gambling tokens. Bitcoin was lucky, it is fundamentally worthless.

Memecoins are more honest!
$15 into $1,000. I‚Äôm set for life.
Was this thread in reference to a particular Meme coin? Just wondering since I am still wet behind the ears and haven't seen a person put $1,000  and end up with .01!! That's got to be a bad taste. I hope my luck never runs out
The whole bone liquidity stuff is weird for me .  Usually you can swap it to Bitcoin or ETH then liquidity it
Thanks this is exactly what I need as someone who bought Doge at 0.06, sold at 0.04, and has watched it go up every day since
That's why I put only $50 in. All these people dropping $10K, $5K, $1K in Dogecoin this week, power to ya but that's money I'd 100% put into something else.
This is true for more than just investments. An obvious example is a famous actor or artist telling you to just follow your dreams. Well of course they'll say that. Look where following their dreams got them. But try asking the thousands of failed actors/artists working in low skill job barely scraping by what they think about following dreams.

Always make back your initial investment ;3 that way the extra is risk free for you to play with
I'm different from your average meme coin investor though. I've successfully managed to break even over the last 2 months on the $500 I randomly splashed around in stupid shit for fun. It's a perfectly diversified memecoin portfolio.
I put in 1300 into doge, I‚Äôm at 3800 that was two weeks ago until today... I lost money in everything else I lost money on Bitcoin, I lost money on etherium, I lost money on about three other small crypto, I made back all I lost and made a profit with dogecoin. Insult it all you want, but it‚Äôs where I‚Äôm making money, and I reinvest the money into doge and make more later...... so ya I‚Äôll just keep doing that for awhile
put 93 cents in doge when it was just under 1 cent and now it‚Äôs 70$üòé
If it was that easy for everyone to get rich, everyone would be rich... And when everyone‚Äôs rich, no one‚Äôs rich. You‚Äôd have a true communist system lol. As the economy currently functions, money doesn‚Äôt just grow on trees. Wealth can be created, but it has supply, demand and limits. Those who make money on stocks and crypto (something my stepfather aptly said is essentially gambling with the current bull market as we discussed our crypto/ stock gains/ losses, FOMO, and regret for missing out on some cryptos/stocks early on) are essentially going to be making it at the expense of others who sell at losses or buy at peaks, as implied here. Play the gamble and take the risks, but don‚Äôt dump so much in that losing that money financially ruins you. And realize that as with all investments/ gambles, there‚Äôs a hell of a lot of luck involved as well. That said, to the moon! üöÄ
If someone puts in $1000 and ends up with $0.1, that's not the cryptos fault, as it kept setting new ATH. It's more like that person panic sold during a correction.
I put 18,000 spread across a variety of meme imvestments and they pretty much all failed. It's a gamble.
I‚Äôm gonna be happy with my 800 in eth that turned into 1600. Annoyed I didn‚Äôt buy more a couple months ago, but oh well.
And there‚Äôs those selfish ones that want you to HODL
In the current bull market it is almost impossible to turn 1000 to 0.1. But that time will come indeed.
Can someone explain what ‚Äúthese meme coins don‚Äôt have liquidity‚Äù means? Serious. Lol like they can‚Äôt cash out their huge profits?
Invest what you can afford to lose.  Anything more and it's gambling pretty much.
Only risk money you can afford to lose is always the way to go. Survivorship bias is exactly right. People only look at the success stories, not the numerous failure that accompany them. No one could anticipate BTC blowing up, just as no one can anticipate dogecoin blowing up or at what level it will stop or regress. It‚Äôs a type of gambling and that‚Äôs okay as long as you know what you‚Äôre getting into.

Something a lot of people forget as well is that crypto very much has the same problem that the stock market does. You need to have money to make money. Going from 10k to 15k isn‚Äôt life changing. 1 million to 1.5 million is. Crypto is only an opportunity missed if you have the numbers to take advantage.
Oh well buying more SHIB n hopefully I‚Äôm the guy that makes 100k lol if not nothing changes for 500 ¬£quidsüöÄüöÄüöÄüåùüåùüåùü¶äü¶äü¶ä
This post hit the nail on the head. I got caught in the hype and lost all my rent and spending money on doge. 

Of course going all in is always advised against but to be honest, people who are going through depression like me are less likely to care about losing it all (if i cant pay rent, i'll be evicted, and in turn lose my job) but want every opportunity to gain something, hoping for a light at the end of the tunnel.

My hope for fortune has made me lose it all, my landlord already hates me because they do a crap job and i always call them out for it. Only a matter of time before I lose my job as I need to work from home but soon wont be able to. 

I dont want this to come across as a sob story. It is what it is. But everyone like me who is depressed and hoping on fortune, please dont follow the hype of influencers promising gains. They are effectively part of the scam. They got in early and need your money to push the price - OF COURSE they'll promise unrealistic targets of $5 or times ten.
Yeah people keep hitting me up like ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you hold on to your doge?!?!?!‚Äù 

Because in the time I could have held onto doge, I‚Äôve bought a Litecoin, an ethereum coin, tons of algorand, tons of cardano, some cosmos and lost some money on a few projects I would say have as much of a chance as doge to succeed

I would have made..... 1,300 on my original 100 doge investment, from moving my crypto and trading other coins I‚Äôve got an account worth 2300 now

Yet still people call me an idiot for dumping my doge at .45 cents like waaaaaay back

All I know is this, I‚Äôm not holding the bag, and I made money off of doge, in my opinion I won, maybe not as much as many but I didn‚Äôt lose money, and I learned something
What is with the DOGE coin hate.   DOGE coin will likely outlast 99% of the other ""Better"" cryptos out there.  


DOGE is more than a meme currency now,   if you cant see that you're blinded by bias.
Yeah bro, I'm satisfied with the 10x I cashed out on this coin 

*keeps checking the charts kicking himself every time he sees the coin beyond 1000x*
Too true. Best video on how to devise a crypto portfolio where you never worry about the dethroning of Bitcoin again.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LNIU5iJfnb0
Introduce me to apps, mining and investments please.
All the people who dumped $10K into gamestop because of memes too.... That's why I wouldn't dump anything worth worrying over into doge!
And the many who put in $500, stayed up all night for weeks in end sweating buckets, saw their portfolio go up to $600, cashed out and felt great until they raised they could have made the same money working an extra shift or two. ü§¶
think that we are in Meme coins period for huge gains!!!After SHIBA, ACITA INU etc i think that  LEMUR FINANCE(similar project with few holders) has the potential to go to the moon üåòüåò  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ!!!
Huge potential!!!
Bough Algo nd It went boom then bought safemoon it went boom for 30 dollars flipped it to 500 dollars then bought refinable and lost basically everything lmao
Actually feeling suicidal over being rugged so often 
I shouldn't care its just money and overall I'm way over my initial crypto investment but damn its heartbreaking
Paper hands
Requires patience and the blessing from Elon Christ lol
A lion never looses sleep over the opinion of Sheep! Y‚Äôall are very concerned with what others are doing!?!  Best of luck to everyone
If you hold it till next cycle it isn't an issue. Don't be dumb and sell you just have to wait longer
Don't worry, Polygon will save us.
Only put in what you can afford to throw into a fire. 
Nothing more.

If you risk your safety net you are stupid,.
Is that's how you judge things? Is that that what a parent tells a child? Yeah Johnny up the block is successful but many failed and barely have $5 in their pockets in this neighborhood. During the Dot.com Era only a few stocks became successful and darlings of Wall Street many disappeared do we talk about the ones that didn't make? People lost alot of money. For ten years Microsoft was at about $25 if you got tired of waiting and sold does not mean Microsof was a bad investment?. Facebook after its IPO went down for awhile many sold were they suckers? I know that's stocks or equities but the same has to be done in crypto you have to DIVERSIFY invest in a few and see who comes out the winner in years to come
Last week i put $100 each into two brand new cryptos (safegem.finance and HakunaMatata.finance). Gem turned my $100 into $25 in a week, and TATA turned my $100 into $1100 in a week. I‚Äôm HODLing both, but if they both die, $200 was an ok amount for me to lose. Treat crypto like the casino. Only put in what you‚Äôre willing to lose.
Clucoin get in on the early stages.
You don‚Äôt hear about it because no one cares. No one cares to see a grown man cry because he put 10k in and now he‚Äôs down 90%. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called ‚Äúholding on for dear life‚Äù. So hodl your paper hands as quit bitching! If a little kid did it then so can you.
It‚Äôs really important to know Shiba it‚Äôs a long term investment, long, long, long put you money and wait may 2, 5 or even 10 to 20 years
Remember, for someone to make 1 million, someone else has to lose 1 million, and obviously you will only hear about the one who won!
Yeah. Just hodl
It's what I did
And I'm that ""kid"" 23
It‚Äôs luck for most buy the right coin at the right time overnight millions. FOMO in after a huge rip and lose at least short term and then you either gotta HODL and hope for another rip down the road or take the loss if you need the cash. That‚Äôs how I learned the hard way not to buy at all time highs. LOL
Hey guys Is ETH 2.0 a new coin? If it is how can i buy this?
I put in 70$ and it bubbled 10x and I took the money out and it was on Robinhood. 700$ I made. Hear that? Pretty good for just throwing in 70$ when it was at .05
Fuck ‚Äòem. They stupid for buy high and sell low. Fuck ‚Äòem.
For some to win many others must lose
Ksi üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Tell me about it. 5 years ago I had about 50000 xrp and cashed out long before it hit $1
Play at your own risk.
This is why I don‚Äôt put in that much money
I only follow what I believe.
I put $100k into Sandalcoin and lost it on Cryptobeach 
Now I‚Äôm in hot water
I hurried myself home to buy the dip, did a fast hi to my grandmother and in the end the dips keeps dipping, regrets.

Wish i stayed abit longer with my grandmother
You also won't hear that if you report crypto on your taxes, you have to write down every single transaction. And you get charged per.
This post really depends. You need skill to search for this shitcoins as well. You can lose on every market. I have never gotten a loss with 10 of my shitcoins
100% I swear these meme coins are a trojan horse begging for regulation by being open pump and dump that normal people fall for. People who don't know anything about the markets or how crypto actually works or basic economic principles on coin Supply and market cap
The latter is usually the case. Most love that lotto scenario.
Sounds like a bunch of boomers with fomo tbh
For every Doge Millionaire, must be hundreds of Doge Paupers (hopefully no Doge Bankruptcies!)
Help.

I was an alt maximalist
i don't recall doge ever experiencing a 99.9% dip. maybe they aren't taking about it cause it never happened?
Id love to win the lottery too,  sadly I'm not willing to drop 500 on a random shit coin thats worth 0.009
Damn if you bought this small dip with some big money you gained already alot
$500 in dogecoin comes out to about $100k for a broad portion of last year and this year.

This is odd to interject but I would like to add there is a demographic in common on reddit, between certain stocks and cryptos.

And it looks to me like reddit memes benefit from each other.
Emax anyone?
I dont have to hear about them when I sit next to them at work. Crypto in general is just a constant struggle to suppress FOMO.
How does one earn moons? I‚Äôm new here please help!
Very well said
At some point, the crypto markets will have to mature if they are going to get widespread adoption and larger investment into mainstream financial instruments like mutual funds. Traditional markets don't routinely lose 70-80% of their value for no reason, that kind of movement undermines trust in markets.
I was a Dogellionare that sold in December/January for Bitcoin. I thought I was all smart doing that. Figured I‚Äôd put it into a serious coin.

Shit happens man. Sometimes you wish you just hodl‚Äôd. We all wish we bought at the bottom and sold at the top. The thing is, the top‚Äôs always get surpassed. Not saying it don‚Äôt matter when you buy, but just hodl.
That's why you split the shitcoin investments. I like to split 100 USD into 10 shitcoins at 10 each. The one which doesn't tank will usually cover your losses on the rest.

Just make sure you so some research first, run the contracts through some initial analysis tools to check for ownership renouncement, that sell functions work, if burn addresses are at 0x00: etc
If you jump in when everyone is talking about it, you most likely will lose money. Buy low sell high. Don't buy anything you don't know anything about. Don't borrow to invest and buy the major dips to cost average lower. What goes up comes down
Hundreds? I'm sure that number is creeping into the millions...
There are 16 year olds that think a summer job is a waste because they can make money off crypto instead. Where will that lead them?
True - this is why you have to manage your own risk. I‚Äôm now involved with a new token on stellar  called meowcoin - only buy a little and you won‚Äôt have to deal with stress.
Hey OP, this is a very relevant post. Interestingly, I just read an article on BBC about crypto addiction that I was gonna post, but it‚Äôs no long necessary after coming accross your post. It is easy to say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt invest more than what you can‚Äôt afford to lose‚Äù, something I‚Äôve said before, but people are different, and it is at least ‚Äúnice‚Äù to sympathize with others. Anyways, here‚Äôs the link for the article if anyone is interested https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-57268024
Turned $200 babydoge into $3000 over the weekend. Yeehawww.
Stop investing in meme coins, and do your due diligence on projects you invest on !

Go see u/cryptorights ! 

They aim to fight this scam shit...!

Easy to post your winning lottery ticket
People will always be out for high reward gambles. 

Its a reason why being able to execute delayed gratification correlates with IQ. (See ""Marshmellow experiment"" its cute)
Governments now are stepping in to ""protect investors""... It's gonna get ugly
Nah you hear about them too, cause they keep posting their stories to get MOONs.
This guy knows what he's talking about. Do not FOMO in, develop a strategy and put away feelings. And maybe high volatility is not for everyone, just buy index fonds and play it safe. And invest only what you can throw away now.

I learned this the hard way entering GME at 292 because of FOMO. I had a strategy and should know better but I let my feelings win and I lost 2.5k. It has to be enough for a lesson.
I‚Äôm just an average person, So I took a risk and I pulled $400 out of my sons savings account I made for him and I bought Dogecoin With it, and I‚Äôve already got 1,500 so I made 1100 in profit to put back in there. I know it may not be much but he‚Äôs only four right now so I guess every little bit helps right?
Whatever makes you feel better. My co worker got me into ethereum in December. Spent week and after week learning about it and decided decentralized finance truly is the future. Put 10k of my bonus in December 10th and my portfolio is now hovering around 40k lol. One of the largest trading sites Kraken is extremely easy to liquidate any ‚Äúmemecoin‚Äù or any coin. ACH bank transfer from my kraken account to my bank account in 2 hours. You‚Äôre a little misguided my friend. Sorry you don‚Äôt understand!
You hear about the guy who hit the jackpot at the casino and made $1M off of $2? You also don‚Äôt hear about the guys and girls who also go to the casino every weekend and lose there money and maybe even their house? What‚Äôs your point with this post. Shitcoins are a complete gamble just like OTC and SPACs are with stocks. It‚Äôs full on risk and everyone knows this before going into a position. Stop posting shit like this as if people need to have their hands held for their poor decision between risk and reward. You win some and you lose some. If you put in more then you were prepared to lose, that‚Äôs on you no one else.
there is something called stop-loss. Just saying
Underrated post
The way I see it, if you put $1000 dollars into any coin then you should be comfortable with it turning into $0. Dont invest what you can't afford to lose
If you‚Äôre left with $0.1 sounds like a case of should of DYOR.
Not this fucking post again
You hear about the thousands of crypto enthusiasts here with well researched portfolios which are getting outperformed by the village idiot's Portfolio of BCD, ETC , Doge Coin and Shiba Inu coin
Hear me out tho‚Ä¶ next meme coin that hits I‚Äôm putting one weeks pay on it and letting it ride. This shit is insane and I want a piece of it.
Bro the only way you don‚Äôt have money from doge is if you put money in at .74
Which it has been at twice. Lol tf are you even talking about. And who dumps 100k into a spike? They deserve to be broke, don‚Äôt blame a crypto for peoples stupidity.
it‚Äôs ridiculous to me how most people don‚Äôt understand financing/investing basics. people shouldn‚Äôt be putting all their money into one asset like that, especially into something that provides no real service. dogecoin isn‚Äôt trying to innovate, it‚Äôs just a meme. investing into shit with no real value or competence behind it is just gambling. smart people don‚Äôt gamble, they invest... and rich people tend to be smart.
Buy safemoon instead
I haven‚Äôt heard of a lot of people losing much with crypto at all. If you hold it usually rebounds. The people who lose are the ones who sell.
Win some and lose some when you play that game I put 100.00 each into two meme coins on dxsale the next day I cashed out 12 bnb from one the other went full rugpull two weeks later worth 16.00 I can‚Äôt sell it.
Can confirm. I bought dozens of meme coins about 5 years ago. All of them are worthless.
You only lose when you sell.
Yeah you also hear about people who take out loans to buy Doge, that is not gonna turn out well!
I put $4,500 in and last I checked it was close to $18,000. What should I do?
It's like a lottery winner giving advice how to do it.
I‚Äòm so tired of posts like this one‚Ä¶
Buy Doge and stop whining like a little bitch
It‚Äôs called not being a boomer and dropping coin in coin you‚Äôre willing to part with. Don‚Äôt be a paper hands just buy doge. This isn‚Äôt financial advice, I just like the st0nk.
You vs the guy she told you not to worry about:
  
ETC vs ETH
I put $10 each into two memecoins and $700 and $450 in less than a week. 

Does that count? But, I do this professionally. If *you* do it, you will likely lose your money.
Everyone likes to tell all about their wins, but not many tell their stories of loss.
Only really stupid people show their portfolio with millions and open the chance to be recognized, killed and robed.
Anyone who puts $1000 in a meme coin and refuses to accept any amount of profit that isn't enough to retire themselves for life deserves to lose everything
Can't lose if you don't cash out
They'll all burn. Doge will burn and some whales will bank. Or smart ones going out. All others will burn so just stick to eth bitcoin dot or whatever.
I‚Äôve been doing alright, my biggest trick I‚Äôve found is buying small nibbles over and over versus all at once.
Isn‚Äôt it odd how the news never has stories on the millions of people who lose the lottery? For some reason they focus on the few who win. ü§î
And you won't sell at the top anyway you'll probably pussy out at like +150%
Man..I really don't understand the hype around this shit coin
FOMO is a real thing. It happens in every crypto bull run. 2017 was only 4 years ago. I guess people don't (or don't want to) remember.
Sounds like a losers mentality to me
This sub is such a salt mine lmao
I put 300 in doge it's now sitting at 5,100
Same amount in shib which is now sitting at 9,678,
Risking 600 bucks is fine with me will probably cash out the doge next couple of days will give shib another few months and then decide
To add to that, Dogecoin is a very mature coin. Made back in 2013 and has had a strong consistent following and active developers the entire time. That kind of pedigree is rare.
Lol okay kid, whatever you say.

I hate how this subreddit cries about dogecoin so much lol

Ive made over $4000 on dogecoin already and im still holding for the $1 mark.

Ive pulled out over $5000 from my holdings along the way but whatever its a meme coin sorry that it hurt your feelings.

Its still a crypto thus it should be accepted on this subreddit too. Quit crying.
you haven't missed out, dogecoin will be to $5-10 in a couple of years
Y‚Äôall slaty af about doge
Seems like someone is pissed not engaging in the meme coin when it was worth 3 cent eh?
Please tell us about every single person that played Powerball last week and did not win.
Every time I say this I get downvoted into oblivion. 

Good for you getting to be honest but not penalized for it.
Yet every time I call out crypto as a ponzi,  I get downvoted.
Seriously people due diligence. This is just a whiny post in my opinion I lost ten grand when I started. Up 20k and even more don't want to give an exact number. DUE DILLIGENCE. it goes with everything you buy. Even a dam car. How much you spend. Etc.
Just like church. Pastor likes to talk about ""answered prayers"". What a fucking insult to the guy who still asks for prayers but just defaulted on his mortgage, car, and kids braces.

We don't talk about it.
You hear a lot about the guys that either forgot their password or threw out their computer losing potentially millions.  Media turns their stories into some kind of modern day treasure hunt.
A lot people salty because they could have made big gains with Doge but were too busy mocking the people putting money into it ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[removed]
The funny thing is for every winner there are a thousand losers. All crying into their ice cream and swearing off crypto for life. They drift away from the internet and all things technology, planting potatoes in a sad remote field. 
They never post again. The crypto robbers gloat and the potato farmers never invest again. Until Doge hits 70 cents and they fucking Fomo in instead of doing what any sane person would do and buy $fox.
I bought $800 in eth at the peak of the pump in 2018. Then ended up changing 50% of it to xrp. Then sec knocked on xrps door... So then i took the $150 left and put it into doge lol.

Not touching it ever again unless to sell (hopefully).
I'm that ""kid"" bought doge years ago. 500 bucks got me 241k doge. Sold last time it hit .69. Screw meme coins though. I got lucky at best.
Yeah....you do
Glad someone said this.
The only memecoin that matters is doge coin. I look at it more like a nft without any ether gas fees and it is highly liquid. The community is awesome and it really rocks with the Reddit boys.

My only other two coins I really like are ADA and Ether.
You guys are OBSESSED with Doge, it's actually pretty sad. Go get a job or something holy shit, enough with the mindless FUD 24/7. Most of you don't even know how doge works because you couldn't pass algebra 1.
FANTOM BUY AND U WILL BE RICH IN 5 YEARS
You, except crypto is literally a zero sum game, to win, you have to beat someone. Maybe if you're researching all the time, but otherwise gains are luck, if you research less than the average (weighted by investment size, which works against you further), then you need to get luckier than average. If you're just jumping on the bandwagon odds are you'll do worse than average because that's the bare minimum of research short of random trades.
I put $50 into doge futures when it was running from 0.65 to 0.75 yesterday but it dipped before rising and liquidated me so fast. Before that I couldn't bring myself to buying in, but the SNL thing seemed like a sure profit. Will never touch it again.
What coins have hit a high and gone down to almost nothing? The 1000 to 0.1 doesn‚Äôt make sense to me
Dogecoin will be the bear market creator.

Once it falls, and hard it will eventually.. I think that'll be the catalyst for a drop in the market.
I actually haven't heard of anyone losing all their money in crypto. I just hear about it steadily going up. That's how stocks work, they only go up.
Because he panic sold

You don‚Äôt hear about me losing 160 bux from the shitcoin where everybody else made a 10k profit.  

You don‚Äôt hear that.
You call it a ""memecoin"" that the kid put money on. You dont respect it even after It has gone soaring. Youre just mad youre not as smart as you thought you were. Beat yourself up for that.
There are actually people out here buying doge at 50¬¢. ü§°ü§°ü§°
Yeah, that's because it didn't happen. Stop making shit up.
Why are we so sour towards other coins? 
Can‚Äôt a persons enjoy a few different coins? 
Lots of negativity in this sub. 
Just saying.
Turned $15 into $2,000 soooo.
Yesterday I turned my +400$ profit account into  -$110. I am depressed as fuck. üò≠
Uh I pulled out fine without any resistance with the ""memecoin"" over 15k actually but sounds like maybe your mom should have pulled out better since you're such a little bitter human now that spreads false narratives trying to convince people to jump.
TBH. If you're only left with $0.1 after $1000 then you Suck.  Nothing ever went down that much.
Been with doge since .05 and up $4k.  Just wanted play with fun money and gonna HODL. Crypto‚Äôs volatile so not sweating he up and down swings.  Even when I was up to $10k before SNL.  It will recover, just need to wait it out like all crypto.  BTC was in the same boat in its infancy.  It might not be as much at BTC but profits are profits.  You just need to be smart and invest what you can afford to lose. üíéüôåüèº
Sounds like something someone who missed out would say.
Important!
This is such an important point

Good thing none of the apps i use even have the meme coins to buy
[removed]
Buy something serious is the first step to become rich. Avoid cryptocurrencies is the first step to not to lose money
Lmao the saltiness is so fucking real
What is your problem with people making money?
In on butthurt over doge thread 56th edition
I have cashed out many times.  This is inaccurate information.
Don't worry tomorrow you'll hear it from me.
I put 1k in Dogecoin a week ago now it's 2666k
Nobody has invested 1000 in doge coin and came out with $0.1

Do you know how this works?

You don't know how to cash out because you're dumb
Just on a lark, I put $100 in bitcoin through Coinbase. It dropped down to $95 and has stayed there ever since. Yeah...I think I'm gonna pass on these types of investments.
They only lost that money cause they sold and had paper hands. Otherwise they would still have their coins.
Pft dogey boy to the moon
From 800$ to 120k thank you shiba Inu :p
Life changing.
Yes I was rugged before this, but great risk  can mean great rewards.
I‚Äôm literally having such a hard time accepting the fact that I sold my crypto for a loss back in January. I didn‚Äôt even need the money, just sold it because I figured it would dip and I‚Äôd just buy back in. I‚Äôve been investing for over 5 years and have yet to turn a single profit. Thousands of dollars worth of stablecoins (ETH, BTC, LTC) and hundreds upon hundreds of dollars into several alts such as Mana, Matic, Algo, Ada, & Doge. I sold just about everything at a loss except Algo which never even ‚Äúpumped‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm like actually getting depressed. After doing the math, if I held onto it like I wanted to I would‚Äôve been a literal millionaire. I‚Äôve known about Doge specifically for over 4 years because of a forum I frequent. It was very popular a few years ago and tons of money flowed into it.

What can I do to mentally move on from this? It‚Äôs taking such a toll on me that I sold everything at a loss just for it to each new all time highs that would‚Äôve literally put me into the 7 figures. I‚Äôm 21 years old and I lazily passed on life changing money. I actually can‚Äôt sleep.
There's nothing funnier than people losing money on stocks (See: WSB daily threads- LOSS). 

&#x200B;

Losing 50$ on Dogecoin? Priceless.
I work really hard for my money. I can't fathom throwing it into some meme coin. Then again I don't gamble or play lottery and I understand coin fundamentals or the lack thereof.

I'll take my YOY 25x+ gains on real coins over a hail mary meme coin anyday. You don't have to gamble on memes to make life changing money.
LOL üòÇ nice straw man
I went yolo on every overdraft I had and didn‚Äôt regret it.

Big ball plays yield big rewards some times, we‚Äôre just gambling and idec about my credit 10/10 anti horror story, would do again
USD 500 to USD 100,000 in 3 months is luck.

USD 500 to USD 100,000 in 5 years is a skill.
show me just one example of someone losing 99.9% of their investment....
turned 7k into 600k atm with GMR (Gamer finance) , you can actually use it on League of Legends
All of this is a scam.. government should investigate
Yeah we just need to choose the right projects and keep our minds clear on the long term strategy, don't fall into the mania people, we can make a lot of money, don't be impatient
Another thing crypto taught me, although not all will go back to ATHs, hold long enough and they pump again eventually üòÇ
Who?
Thanks for making me feel better‚Ä¶
Sad but true
So proud of my son.
For two years this sub was nothing but a bunch of people in the red.
My 800 Harmony ONE coins will make me rich someday!  Check back in 3 years :)
Weeeeeewho moons and wut not
Hindsight is perfect, but in practice coins do random random stuff at the best of times. As always DCA into the good projects, and only invest what you can afford to lose.
The 100k have to come from somewhere, it's not fiat printed on paper ....wait ...
I wonder what‚Äôs the biggest gain for a meme coin is.
Hmm....there should be a r/cryptobets for this kind of thing.
Wait. We protecting everyone from any losses now? 

Sign me the fuck up.
Always Strange ... If U stay with coins which got a good Marketcap and are Not a Scam U will probably Not loose all your Money. Tbh Sometimes i think the Chance too loose Money By forgetting the Seed is much Higher than Loosing it BC the coin goes down to hell
But, but... I was told there will be lambo. 

Is it just me who thinks doge is being manipulated? Or people put so much money into it?
The same with slot machines. You hear the glory stories of wins bit not the endless nights of losses
Well not so long ago there was a post about a gut that invested 100k into shitcoins i think ans it went to 0.
the two are mutually dependant.
that poor kid got stuck in 6 figure hell.  who would want that fate?
hundreds? of thousands
I Sw
I‚Äôve never been a big gambler, hence why I stay out of DOGE and SAFEMOON and other garbage like that. I would for sure be one of the stories of going from $1000 to $0.1
We don't do that here meme
Well said. As someone who's know to investing in general - not just crypto - this is a universally important thing to consider.
I realize myself how it's not that easy to get into the proper mindset and not fall into any hype/FOMO traps.
Yup
No one likes to talk about failure, which is a shame because it helps others not make the same mistakes and improve themselves.
It is important to not allow [Survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) to cloud ones judgement when thinking about these things.

But one also has to take into account that the only ones that lose more than 98% in the long term are those that go all in on low cap coins, which is basically like going to a casino. Most people that diversify into top coins almost never lose money in the long term (5 years - longer than a single bear or bull cycle).
Yah he did not set it up to pay the tax ...threw interest.
Going that route buy gold
All I hear is how risky crypto is! What do you think they're talking about?
We hear about both.
Good day to hear it considering all my shitcoins are pumping. Taking my (small at best) initial investments out when I'm up and hoping for the best!
This is true. You only hear about the winners.
Whenever I hear about stuff like this I just think of the people who paid said kid probably losing their money.
who is that kid?
Now come on we don‚Äôt want to hear that.. we‚Äôre here to get rich off the casino.. but as of now, I‚Äôm still working.....
Meanwhile here I am almost 30 only putting in $30 and checking the charts every 30 seconds and cheering that I‚Äôve gone up $0.30 in 24 hours :D
They are suckers. Nobody cares
Cries in POE  and APPC üò¢
Survivorship bias is just the worst. So many dumb decisions are made everyday because we only see the ones that made it.
[removed]
i put 1k in on shib lol i dont like meme coins but it got me over 100M coins lol ill let it ride. its free money after the killin ive made with $tel so whatever
Ehh I see loss/gain porn all the time. People lose, people win...
Found the guy who refuses to buy DOGE

these posts should be banned already
$1000 in, left with $0.1 ?  How did you hear ?
And here I am holding doge on exodus wallet not knowing how to cash out (without swapping to BTC, etc)
Why you guys care so much about others money?
I sometimes wish I had invested more but I could only invest what I could afford at the time. I am happy with the results I have gotten.
I made $6000 in two months and cashed out to pay off some debt. I left my initial investment. Hoping to do it again.
Preach. Like meme coin is so boasted about today people jumping in at .70 and not thinking about the downfall. But hey I‚Äôm up $11!!!!!!!
Most likely tens of thousands (if not x10 that) of people have sold at a substantial loss after bull runs because they didn't think it would recover. For every lottery winner there are many more that loose it all.
You also don't hear about the people that made modest 5-10% gains.  There's nothing sexy about sound investment strategy or losing a grand.  It's all about YOLO these days.
Yeah I'm sure the vast majority of people who buy high and sell low aren't out there telling their story.  People don't like to relive the dumb decisions they've made and invite ridicule.
Bad example. Namecoin is not an investment coin, and likely nobody has ever made bank off Namecoin's price. In fact, Namecoin is not likely to *ever* be a good investment.

But it \*is\* a good coin, with good properties, for storing key/value data, and because it merged-mines on Bitcoin, its ledger is extremely secured. (That's why it doesn't need a price and is a bad investment coin. It's already secure via merged mining no matter what its price is.)

So fuck off and don't bring Namecoin into your ""all altcoins are bad"" shit-flinging BTC-maxi nonsense. Namecoin is an amazing coin no matter what its price is.

I swear, what is it with you guys and your fucking jelly whenever alts start doing anything. Jesus, get a fucking hobby.
Ok who? Who put $1000 into crypto and exited at $.01?
I'd like to hear about that.
Well, if you convert meme coin or any alt coin to USD coin then transfer to USD it‚Äôs actually fairly simple...
Okay. But like. Its gambling in all seriousness. So does anyone think that snl will be good or bad for thr shit coin?
Survivorship bias
I put in $20 and ended up with $80 üò§‚ú®
Many people really need a hard lesson to understand the Crypto and safe assets
[removed]
I only put 100 in on any new high risk, was burnt a couple of days ago on happyape HAPE

no one likes to discuss the rugs i guess
Your right just Google searched couldn't find anything about a kid losing it all on DOGE. Did find a bunch of articles of people losing it all on Bitcoin though.
I see the value in Doge as a short-term play but I personally refuse to invest in a coin I don't believe in.  Again, if you're looking at this as a risky short-term investment to try and make a quick profit; you're doing it right and you're probably better at this than me.  I just don't want to own a coin that essentially doesn't do anything.  Still love the meme though.
But with inu coins we all get rich, right?
Tell me more about this can‚Äôt cash out because of liquidity issues. That is my main fear with all this. Seeing my virtual money grow but then I go to take it out and boom, I‚Äôm fucked.
we talking about wolfchaos?
And you see a post like this here at least once a month.
Yeah I mean its one thing to bet on a actual project, something that will achive something. It an other to bet on  a meme, an inflationary coin.....
My fiance is not familiar with cyrpto. We discussed it. She asked about Doge and asked if I would do that. I said no, because I didn't believe in it and couldn't afford to gamble the money. Maybe 1000% maybe lose 99.99%. Figured she'd be annoyed others made a quick buck. She commented if I was going to gamble and possibly lose it all I may as well go to casino where I can have a beer and a burger. Good perspective.
Let me guess, you missed out...
I'm finally start to take crypto seriously this year! I was one of the fools who could'nt jump on board for years. I only have 10% of my assets in crypto I'm playing it safe.
You also dont hear about me cuz I have no funds to invest in the first place.
Only do it if it‚Äôs fun money. Gambling is fun - but you don‚Äôt gamble with your savings.
Then they come brag about how smart they are with their investment when really they just won the lottery.
So you are saying theres a chance?
I missed the doge train booooo cry me a river
Had this conversation with someone about Safemoon. He said he‚Äôs made a lot of gains on it and doesn‚Äôt why I won‚Äôt buy in. I then explained by simply asking him to sell some of it. The conversation didn‚Äôt go much further.
What does ""You also don't hear about the guys who put $10,000 but cant cash out because these memecoins have no liquidity."" mean? Serious question, just trying to learn something!
Posts like this that are lucid, nuanced, and honest are the reason this is the only crypto sub I still follow and don‚Äôt filter out of my feed. Consistently people here show maturity about what crypto really is, and is not. Keep it up guys, too many subs devolve into cults, from Tesla to investing to crypto. You must have decent mods.
You ask anyone thats gone to a casino about it they're gonna tell you with a twinkle in their eye about this huge hit on a slot machine but not about the fact they put all that money back into several other machines the rest of the night.
Exactly, buy coins wisely and know that doge is not a project and is a meme.
Buddy bought shitload of denta coin... DENTA COIN!!!. Somehow he is pretty well off now...
tbf. a lot of those that lost money, would have long made it back. 

Overall, the amount of good projects that people invested in, shows that the market isn't all just pump and dump.

And anyone who puts all their money in one thing, expecting it to be the biggest thing ever, should seriously reconsider their decision making process.
Well said my dude, well said
On a serious note, is it possible to put 1k in and lose it all? I don't know much about crypto but even if bitcoin was to crash right now, it's unlikely it'll drop to 0 right? Even if it dropped 25k you'd still have 500 left right?
This is happening at work right now. This you guy put a lot of money into doge when it first came out and now he‚Äôs earned a little over $1mil. He‚Äôs waiting for it to hit $1 so he can sell it all for $3mil. So now everyone I work with is obsessed and they think they‚Äôll be millionaires too if they keep buying that coin.
I put 500 euro into doge and have made 10k ish but I'm like if I put my 20ish k TSLA stock in, it'd be like 600k but I'm learning not to beat myself up over it and be happy with the little gains! :)
I loaded up my old Doge wallet file to see if I had anything left. Even though I was 99% sure I cashed it out into BTC back in 2016. Seeing how many millions I used to have and what it would be worth now made me sad for a minute, until I realized what I got mining for a couple of months years ago paid for the van we bought when we had our third kid. And all of that money came from ""nothing."" At the time, my goal was also just to help pay for a new vehicle; and it ended up covering the whole thing. 

Don't be afraid to set obtainable goals. Is there a chance you cash out early? Sure. But there's a bigger chance you never cash out. Doge is worth something now, but the millions of Rabbitcoin, Pandacoin, Cagecoin, Spaghetti coin, Nyancoin, Picardcoin, etc. are worth less now than the cost of electricity to get them.
Yes you do hear about it, because this is getting posted everyday
yup. ppl are fomoing into doge now and its just gonna screw them over. I'll wait until the next one.
Another caveat of that is the group of people who watched their portfolio trace down 90% and held for years and benefitting from their patience. This is why you should tread lightly with shit coins.

Anything outside of ETH or BTC still isn‚Äôt proven enough to warrant a confident long term hold (just my opinion)
Don't invest in what you can't afford to loose. Keeping that in mind, invest in whatever memecoin you want.
Casually turned my 500$ into 3k ish in 1 month.

This seems like a post form a guy who is looking for confirmation bias to tackle his fomo
Exactly this is it, although ‚Äúloss porn‚Äù is a thing on Reddit it would be an annoyance. $hit coins are the worst only a few can win.
I'm down 10% on my memecoin.... I'm listing my Learjet as we speak.
So what‚Äôs your point? Like the Age old Wall Street saying. ‚ÄúBulls & Bears make money,  While Pigs get slaughtered‚Äù . We are Bulls and Bears here. If you are a Pig, get out of here and get slaughtered.... hahaha üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Okay - but here‚Äôs the thing. The same exact thing applies to every single cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency is close to a zero sum game. Which means mathematically speaking the net sum of everyone involved is zero.

In cryptocurrency one person is buying and one person is selling.

Therefore the entire net sum across the entire group is zero.

How about - you replace  ‚Äúmemecoin‚Äù with cryptocurrency- because it literally applies to all of them.

Same thing with the stock market
God, there are gonna be so many Doge posts today, I almost want to stay off today, but I also can't look away.
1 word... cobinhood.
 100k matters üòÇ
I needed to hear this
I'm willing to risk 500 on 3-4 memecoins
The Loss Porn is going to be great this season.
sooo‚Ä¶ the ones left with .1 are the ones who also sold at .1 - You technically never lose if you sell. But nobody is talking about that? Ok, got it.
Unfortunately I know which one I will be.
I'll preface by saying this is usually great advice. 

Doge is a joke, but I got in and made my money. I'm not gonna be a snob about where my returns come from. Profit is profit.  May as well jump in while the tide is rising. The key is knowing when to get out.
What‚Äôs this meme coin you speak of? It‚Äôs for research purposes of course
You do, actually, if you frequent r/wallstreetbets
Exactly this. This is what is driving the market right now.
$3500 down to $150 for me. It even peaked at $35,000, before making its decline.

This time around I learned...
Doge is amazing ,. Don‚Äôt let ignorant people discourage you . It‚Äôs on sale right now, better than a savings account if you wanna forget anything else. Just trying to help ( not a financial advisor) I‚Äôll leave in peace !
I wish I could upvote higher. 

This applies to basically every job, too. Sure, there is this guy who is making some big checks by doing a very specialized kind of gardening that requires tools from the himalaya.

But then there's thousands barely living with that salary, doing the exact same job.
>Survivorship bias is a dangerous thing.


It's amazing that most of the people giving advice sold most of their Bitcoin in 2017 at $16,000 and rebought in 2019 at $5,000
Hear about the guy who put in 2‚Äù and pulled out 9‚Äù??
[removed]
This is so true across wsb with people buy crazy otm options and losing it all when they expire worthless.
If you look through all of them you can figure out which ones are straight.
Il literally both these guys, fortunately the 100k made up for the lost 1k.
Nice photo but where is the render ;)
I turned $100 into $80 with Erithrium (sp?) love giving money away...

#BrewstersMillionsTips
What you don't hear is that the kid who put $500 into a memecoin and can't convert it to fiat cash and has $100k of worthless internet money good for nothing.
open the casino
And people on my Facebook are starting to post about ‚Äúwhat a time to be alive, please use my Robinhood link‚Äù because they made like 40 bucks on ETC 

I hate that this is how people are gonna see crypto
I put in $2000 at .30 and lost $1000 when I sold because I panicked at .19. There‚Äôs not rules to Doge. They say don‚Äôt panic sell, buy at the dip, and hodl. Every account is different. Just be cautious and don‚Äôt put up anything you aren‚Äôt willing to lose. I have since then made my money back. Cheers!
Well. I turned my 300 into 330 üòé
Top 20 coins in market cap. That's how far I would personally go.
Good advice. I bought 200 USD of doge when it was at 5 cents and I saw how fast it's climbing now and almost dumped in way to much when it was at 50 cents but held off.
When 1 person gains, there are 99 person on the line who have lost. Just makes me wonder if those people who are randomly investing beyond their paycheck know of the risk that not everyone will be winning.
Precisely. You hear about the 1 kid who started up in his Mom‚Äôs garage and IPO‚Äôd but never about the 1m kids for whom it never worked out and are flipping burgers. You hear about the 1 kid who boxed his way out of the projects to stardom but never about the 1m who just got beat up over and over again. The 1 who made it in hollywood and the 1m who didn‚Äôt. Standard operating practice to PR and sex up.
You also don't hear about those that do their own research before investing and turn $10K into $100K over a couple years because they didn't panic sell because they understood that crypto is a high-risk investment, and only invested what they could afford to lose.
Same with those that just lost on Bitcoin or ETC .. no difference and it‚Äôs being shorted.
I started with just tipped dogecoins from the dogecoin subreddit.

Turned it to 0.01 daytrading in cryptohub and then cryptohub got hacked hahaha.
Well, I have a link to an Ethereum wallet that I think is mine, but can't figure out how to access it. I enjoy seeing it go up, if I knew how to access it I would have missed the 100x gains.

I'll do a forensic investigation of the computer (image) I mined them on once hit hits $1 million...
I fed $50 to my Dog and he still hasn‚Äôt given me change.
Exactly what I said in the beginning of the week.
The meme coins technically do have liquidity, lol. You can just trade it for Bitcoin and cash right on our. This post sounds super salty.
I am struggling to have any kind of sympathy for anyone who has $10,000 to drop for fun. Lmao
And you do not hear about how that shill lauren across the street be bumpin with Chad from accounting.
This is exactly why I'm definitely not ready to invest a lot into crypto. I started learning about it a couple of months ago, and I'm making about $10 per week, which some would say is nothing, but I think is pretty fantastic for a start. This is a volatile market as far as I've seen, and while there are a lot of success stories, I can't really put my head away from thinking of the plenty who have lost it all.
I made 10 bucks. I funded an exchange with a hundred bucks and they gave me 10 for free. Now THAT is profit.
But uhh...most memecoins are legit doing great. SAFEMOON, DOGE, BONFIRE, SHIBA.  


Literally every major meme coin is up hundreds of percents. 

Like, I get it, the shoe will drop.

But right now, you're more likely to lose that money in stocks or daytrading BTC.

Don't YOLO into a memecoin, but if you want to toss $50 here and there, it looks like those are not bad odds lottery tickets.
Look, somebody just tell me how to turn 1000 into a million without me having to do much of anything.  Please.
Worth noting that was just a screenshot of 1 transaction at the time of purchase. Doesn't mean he held that long or sold at the price. \* i could be wrong but i never saw the transaction hash.
This is why you should just invest what you can afford to lose, treat it like gambling without the flashy lights.
Well, it‚Äôs absolutely only ever going to increase so we‚Äôll all be that rich in 5-10 years. Just a matter of waiting our turn üöÄüíéüßêüò¨üòÇ
I lost 22 000 USD yesterday. But I continue believing in crypto as a future payment method and hopefully I will recover my losses in the coming weeks
I hate when people make the claim ‚Äú I hate to be that go that sold his Bitcoin for pizza, what an idiot‚Äù ok so like are you gonna keep the same 3 dollars for 10+ years? No.
Yeah you do, if you live through the bear.
Yeah only too true mate. Go ask the people who hold thousands of Bitconnect what they‚Äôre doing with it.
Meanwhile, I put $50 into DOGE a few months ago and I could currently sell it for $750.

It's not too late to get in. It's going to continue to rise indefinitely. Sure it feels bad buying in at 60 cents when others bought in at .05 or even .003, but it won't feel so bad when it's at $10.. $100.. $1000.
Try 150 into 1.6 million
More anecdotes for... I turned 300k DOGE into ¬£100k+. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
i'll take a moonshot, but don't strategize for it. i enjoy a slow and steady upward grind, with updated stop orders to prevent losing the initial capital.
There's a saying about 100 years old: ""When the guy who shines your shoes starts giving you stock advice it's time to get the hell out of the market""
Doge are the only gains that are truly irrelevant to me
See, this is why I only put $20 in Dogecoin. I mean, it would be awesome if Dogecoin suddenly skyrocketed and I ended up making a few hundred dollars or something, but at the end of the day, realistically I know I'm more likely to lose my $20 lol. Incidentally, I'm up $20 right now, so score!
Don't. You'll end up with $0.1**
You don‚Äôt hear about the family who put $1000 in and is left with $0.1 because it doesn‚Äôt happen. To the moon
Thank you for the reminder !
Agree.. Made some gains in safemoon. Did day trading, going down hill since then but its I am learning a lot of new things which no one ever taught me so its something.
How many kids have got a spare $1000? If they have that much they can probably afford it. If they can't afford it, then they are likely stupid and would have spaffed the money elsewhere anyway.
SAFEMOONCASH is exploding right now. Monday they get listed on their first exchange. We can all be that $500 kid.
I thought both were obvious?  Both happen in all investment markets.
Thank you for this
This sub is all doom and gloom nowadays.  So whiny.  ‚ÄúYou might lose all your money.‚Äù

No shit!  That‚Äôs every investment!  

Now let‚Äôs get back to talking about what really matters.

Wen moon?  When Lambo?  üöÄüåùüèé
 No nb
That is because they bought during an all time high, this happens with every kind of investing. Also as long as they wait long enough, they will end up with some decent gains. Quite being salty and just go buy this so called ""meme coin"" which by the way isn't really just a meme coin anymore. And one more thing, remember that you are messing with a community that REALLY likes their memes. In other words this is not an argument that you can win or want to be part of. I'll be back to taunt you when the ""meme coin"" hits $1
OK...?
Yeah but is Cryptocurrency about cryptocurrency?
True story.
I bought  \~4500 DOGE in 2018 for 30‚Ç¨

paid out 500‚Ç¨ a week ago and still have \~1500‚Ç¨ worth of dogecoins

Now I just wait if they ever hit \~4‚Ç¨ because I would be more pissed of losing potential \~10k‚Ç¨ than of losing the potential 1500‚Ç¨ I ""*have""* now.

&#x200B;

Though I don't really needed the 30‚Ç¨ back in 2018 or the 1500‚Ç¨(or even the 500‚Ç¨ I have) now.

Don't invest your lifesavings, you know the drill. 

&#x200B;

And I also invested \~200‚Ç¨ in different coins that are all basically worthless by now. I am pretty sure I spend 50‚Ç¨ on something that is now like 0.35‚Ç¨
Great advice.
Crypto.com won't verify my info so i can make any withdraw this is dumb AF. lousy platform
Yyyup, thought I might moon on DRGN lmao
Crypto is a form of gambling, yes?
I had 4000 doge in February and sold when it reached like .09 thinking ""well can't get much better than this."" At least I kept 46 for shits and giggles.
‚ÄúYou should try to learn their names!‚Äù
how do you invest in something you cant withdraw... how do you lose that much if you didnt buy high and sell low?
Then don‚Äôt throw in $1,000 if it will hurt you! I throw hundreds around, not thousands. And I‚Äôve thrown a few hundred now into SAT. Get in while the gettin is good!
Straight out of Taleb. The cemetery is full of people who worked hard, did the right things, didn't become millionaires.

The crypto cemetery is full of people whose finances never recovered from their moves into an alt.
Or we hear about it and don't care because it's our money and we might as well have fun with it. If you put your rent money in stocks or crypto or anything other than rent. You are the dumbass not us.
You also don't hear about my new friend who happens to be a Nigerian prince, who randomly selected me to give me all his wealth.  Yeahhh.... me rich...now...
I think a lot of ""investors"" don't know what liquidity means yet.
I turned 24 dollars in 300 cause I‚Äôm a high roller
Various levels of risk are healthy for an economy. 

Participate in risk levels you are confident within, participate within your means. 

Stop preaching about how people lose or win, these posts don‚Äôt help anyone.
STOP HATING DOGECOIN TO THE FUCKING MOON
I have this incredible strategy for making a couple hundred dollars every day. It‚Äôs called a job.
Which meme coin has driven $1000 to $0.1? That is a scale of ten thousand to one. I‚Äôve never seen any coin lose anything remotely close to that.
What did they do to put 1000 and be left with 0.1? Went to the future to buy at 1.0 then travelled to the past and sold at 0.001?
I've turned my $100 into $175.
Yessir. When someone cashes out big, someone else is buying their coins at a high. This is a casino, not everyone is gonna win big.
I turned $1500 into $627k I bet you don‚Äôt hear about that either‚Ä¶ abut I did hear about the guy who lost 3 millions in a Bitcoin scam lol
THANK YOU. Love this post. I literally don't care about Doge.
the ball is important - diamond hands
What is this post even about? It gives no information except fear. Yes dont buy meme coins, understand what you are buying, dont just be an APE, ( I am one) but I still have a brain. Yes you should have fomo on crypto, the right crypto.
Ehh, just YOLO into Doge right? I mean everyone's telling me it's the next BTC. Lollllll
I put some money into ETH last year. It went up. I sold and bought LTC. It went up, and I sold. Bought ETC. It is going crazy. I didn't lose my initial investment but I missed my chance to make $10k multiple times. I'm just in here doing shit, eating money on fees, and coming out with less and less crypto. If I didn't touch the crypto, just forgot I had it, I would be sitting on $10k+ from my initial $300 in August last year. I'm gonna pull out and come up with a strategy.

Have a strategy people. Don't waste money on fees because you get emotional. I did that and lost some gains. I should have focused on trading to get more coins instead of minimize temporary dollar loses. So stupid.
Survivorship bias
Truth is, 80+% of people who got into crypto in the last year made money because of the bull market we‚Äôve had. It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see who‚Äôs still fully behind crypto when the ghost of bear market past comes to visit. 2017 was real.
Ok ? $500-$1000 in the grand scheme of all things isn‚Äôt jack shit. It‚Äôs a lot to me but when you think about it that‚Äôs not that much
I put about 90 bucks into meme coins two or so weeks ago.  And in that time I've nearly doubled the money I put in.

On one hand I massively regret not putting in much more money, on the other hand I realize I had no way of knowing any of it was going to work out positively and I absolutely could have lost all of it.
This all I see on this sub just talk about something else
I turned my 15 dollars into 500 dollars. I then later got those 500 dollars into 1 dollar
Checking in.
I‚Äôve never put less than 1000 dollars into any investment... except doge I put 18 dollars into doge awhile back and it‚Äôs worth 3800 now.  I certainly wish I put a 1000 but at the end of the day this 3800 is helping to even out my other losses.  Cant be mad at that.
I‚Äôm going to need to see some sources on this whole losing out stuff.

You can‚Äôt just say ‚Äútrust me they‚Äôre out there‚Äù and give no evidence. Lol
Lol was talking to an 18 year old about ""investing"" and was taught how it's easy if you always remember stocks go down on Monday and up on Thursday. 

#yolo
My 700 is currently at over 2000...
Reading this post makes me want to buy more doge
Who got left with 0.1 lmao everyone is up money, sorry you missed out. Oh & if you only invest what you can stomach to lose & pull out your original investment what's to lose? üòÇ
I‚Äôve made a bunch of money on meme coins, and you can sell them, idk what that guy is talking about. Yes there are a ton of rug pulls. So if you‚Äôre not safe you may lose all of your money.  I‚Äôve also done that. Get a little too confident, then lose, then begin revenge trading to get it back. Lose again. And again. And then it‚Äôs goodbye 6k should have made better decisions. But I‚Äôm confident that my losses and stupidity have lead me into places I would have not discovered if I hadn‚Äôt been scammed. I‚Äôm just paying for experience man.
Tell us the story then...
Basically everyone saying investing on crypto may pay off, lot of people saying its not worth in the end and nothing grants you you may win some.

***but*** ***nothing ventured, nothing gained***
Thank you for taking the time to recognize me.
Noob I just made three  *Tree Fiddy*  from a $100 investment
Eh if you know what you‚Äôre doing you can consistently make a lot of money.... I‚Äôve made $108k this month off of three different projects without losing a dime. Of course, you have to do your research and make sure you‚Äôre investing in a winner and that takes a lot of trial and error.
Cuz we got tf out!
Yes, I do wish people would seriously post their losses so it doesn‚Äôt seem so magical.
I bet trading was more peaceful before internet boards amplified FOMO/manipulation/misleading info. Imagine HAVING to do some sort of DD before putting up 0.01 ... though i know this os crypto and not stonks, i think most people going from $1000 to 0.1 is user error. Plus people naturally like motivation more than anything else..
stop talking about me bro
Posts about holding and we're in this together. Take your wins people. Don't be the guy holding the back. Reddit loved to pump gme and say there's a squeeze every day but there's people that bought in at 300 plus and it's been sinking everyday since. Nobody here is your friend. Don't hold thinking it's the greater good.

Personal crypto investment strategy: YOLO.
That hasnt really happened yet. The pyramid is getting bigger.
It‚Äôs because people care about the kid that makes profit and not about the one who loses
Every once in a while I buy shitcoins with money that I can burn. It's gambling but with a slightly higher win rate. Only buy with money you can afford to lose.
So true! Same goes for real estate. It tends to increase in value over time, but people still go bust during downturns. And the people who jumped out of windows during the Crash of 1929 never came back to life :(
Buy high sell low
That is one serious moon farmer...
I always set low expectations for my investments, that way I am super happy when I beat them
It‚Äôs just a thousand bucks. Rinse and repeat
Serious question, how are people losing nearly 100% of their investments in crypto if that crypto didn't completely collapse and lose all value?
Its funny watching people pump scamcoins/memecoins on CryptoMoonShots and then trying to trade out of them only to realize they literally cant sell the coins. They dont check the source and get scammed super hilarious
I‚Äôve put some time to mine doge in 2014 and now I pulled 4K from me doing it 7 years ago. I did it for memes and now memes payed off.

I don‚Äôt consider my self wise but lucky lol.
You dont Hear about Them because they are in shame they panicsold
I bought $55 of DOGE at $0.50. I'm hoping it doubles after Elon goes on SNL, get a tank of gas, the kids a pizza. It's a coin to play or do small gambles with. No way in hell I'll invest anything serious on any meme coin
I made 1k with $10 on safemars...
Solution: More loss porn
DYOR, thats the best way to dont get scamed!

Thanks. Cause I loosely feel that way, haha. Always do cause I just watch and read all the amazing stories. But I have real stocks so it makes me feel less bad.
And u dont hear about ppl who lose thousands in stocks or in vegas etc. I dont get the point in  this ""u dont hear about who put 1000"" And in ur last point do u mean that if u invest in shitcoin and it moons u dont get ur money out?
Survivorship bias üëå
That's what I'm telling myself. I made like 1000$ off Litecoin in 2017 (I think). I keep thinking about ""what if I had dropped my savings into Bitcoin last March"". I have a few coin investments on coinbase, nothing big. It's just hard when reddit is shoving the success stories down my throat with ads and crypto being on popular all the time.
People dont understand you only play with money your willing to throw away
FEG to the moon!!!!!
What about the guy who would have made $100M if they bought BTC at $1?
That's what annoyed me so much about this meme coin hype, everyone is acting like an investing god because they go online and say ""look if you put X into Y a month ago you would have made it,... great its also easy to tell someone the winning lotto numbers after the draw has happened.

Fuck all this crypto bullshit, for real.
This is life
What do you mean by "" cant cash out because these memecoins have no liquidity. "" ?
I still don‚Äôt get how one looses money in the stock market. Especially with KNOWN stock memes counts as well. I‚Äôve been trading for 5 years. My worst trades only slow my growth
I'm a shitty newb investor and I've already doubled all my investments this year... enough to pay for a full basement remodel... so not rich money, but it's money.

I'm lazy, I COULD have invested in Doge but I didn't want all the paperwork to set up a binance account and dont want to involve myself with Robinhood app. I wanted to buy dogecoin for years, just didn't have the time or motivation to do it.

I'm so lazy, I don't even know what other options there are... didn't get into GME... just imagined myself buying the stock when it was $18/share.

I have an NFT collection sitting... too lazy to push that pending miners fee through the multi-factor authentication process.

So if I can make money, a lot of people can
Yeap. It‚Äôs like with the one DJ that makes millions and nobody speaks about the other 1m DJs that don‚Äôt have enough money to eat food
You also don‚Äôt hear about people who put a lot of money during their life on lottery tickets and have less chances to get anything
I see some ‚ÄúSHIB‚Äù meme coin being pumped on Facebook recently
That's cuz those 1000$'s are being leveraged.
I‚Äôm up 2k. I‚Äôm not mad about it
U sound negative. Be positive, confident, and research b4 imvesting.
Which meme coin can you not cash out on?? I paid off $10,000 debt this week after selling a portion of my Doge holdings.
I am getting depressed. I sold too soon in March.  Gone through the 2017 ATH and the 3 year bear. I thought for sure it will crash with all these altcoin pumps in March. My holdings would have gone 10 times now. üò™
I turned 3 BTC into 1 BTC by buying 16 USB blockeruptors.

Along with this, I think more people have to be wary about the ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù or ‚Äúsob story‚Äù type posts or any posts that are trying to gas you up emotionally.  Those stories about hodl because ‚Äúmy dad is a hard worker‚Äù or those corny ‚Äútake care of yourself and hydrate!‚Äù posts just wreak of manipulation.  People want to make money and would choose profit over your well-being 365 days of the year.  That includes Redditors on your favorite finance subreddit.  Don‚Äôt fall for those stupid, low-effort emotional manipulations - they typically have an agenda.  But make sure you drink water, take a deep breath, meditate and get enough sleep üòâ!
I am out of here. Putting my money back into fiat.
I turned $15 into $8,000 with Dogecoin so far. I bought quite a few years ago and forgot about it lol.
What??
I used to own 300k doge a few months back. I'm done.
Or the guy who YOLO'd his entire retirement and sold near peak.

Good advice you got
14yo boy takes small 200k loan from parents to invest in coins.. doubled his money! He now sells you 995$ course through zoom in his moms garage to show you how you can too...

That‚Äôs why you put in $5 to $50 and either you make $100,000 or you don‚Äôt lose much.
The shibu inu address that is now worth 1billion, can easily go up several in the coming weeks.
That reminds me, we haven't seen any suicide hotline posts for a while... We truly are in a bull market right now
Let people have their sunshine man some people touched money they never ever seen before. Some people was able to pay a bill. People lose and people win that‚Äôs life let‚Äôs not rain on people who having fun because you not having as much fun
Contestants on gameshows like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire or Let's Make A Deal confuse me sometimes.

There is marginal utility to money.

If you give me 300K and a chance to risk it for 1M, I'm liable not to take it. 300K gives me a paid off home and some luxuries. 1M gives me a paid off home, some luxuries, and a comfortable emergency fund.

I do have to remind myself that even if I had bought awhile ago I would have cashed out. Paid off my student loan or bought a house sooner. I think a lot of people did that.
This as fast as a post on r/suddenlygay
That's why loss porn is a thing. Acceptance of failure enough to share with others.
Found the spreadsheet with my moonshots from 2017.
It actually would've done better than my consolidated portfolio, but checking it regularly would've been a nightmare. 

10% of tokens are at 0
Another 30% lost value. Some are at the original value and then there's stuff like Bnb, vet, eth
They‚Äôre called bag holders
s/memecoin/crypto/

The above applies to ALL crypto

Crypto only increase in value due to speculation
The real FOMO hasn't yet started. Wait some more weeks or months. We will have the first wave in July.
I'm really good at turning $100 into $80. AMA
I put ~100$ in a shitcoin and now it's worth ~24$
But what will you do now to turn all that moon coin into $0.1?
so you cant just sell these meme coins?
Yeah that's how any kind of gambling gets you.
The people that bought Jaguarswap at 5500$ then an hour later to 700 then to 76$ is ridiculously funny. Do your homework people.
Of course I know him, he's me
Well I think that is going to happen to Doge as well. Before Elon started pumping some wallets bought large amounts. Could these wallets and Elon be linked? When will they dump?
I have to thank you for this. I‚Äôm seeing Dogecoin go up and I‚Äôm over here thinking I should of invested in the meme. Even $100 would be doable. There maybe some success stories but we rarely hear about the failure stories.
All markets do this. Capitalism is horrible overall.

Every bull run in crypto *or* stock has a large mass of people who are clueless but hear about this great opportunity to make endless money. They hear there's some risk but figure meh, doesn't apply to them. They fomo in at a peak and wait for the inevitable windfall and then the market tanks. They hold on, and they hold on, and are convinced it's just a correction, and eventually they land at rock bottom and finally give up and sell. 

And then the coin may recover and they wait far too long to buy back in and repeat the damn cycle, more or less.

Don't be that guy.
The thing is that you wouldn't be losing money if you you had entered the market earlier. 

Understanding WHY one loses money can help them avoid schemes where they chase the market due to FOMO.

I wouldn't touch GME, AMC, Doge, in their current state. I bought Doge at 0.69420 though. Only $500 worth but it's given me much better returns than any other scheme I've ever done, and that's because I bought it at a relative lull before the memers started in full force. Keeping my eyes open for the next great thing.
People need to stop marrying their coins unless it‚Äôs top 10 and even then I‚Äôd narrow it down to top 3. Nothing wrong with steady gains, yes sometimes you miss out on the real top but more often than not you should take your profits and be happy.
There is so much FOMO going around, especially with all the ads for crypto being pushed out
Thats why I am not trading, but staking  eg SPDR with NESTS program, since it offers the best VPN and DAO solutions and 80% APY
[removed]
Doge definitely isn't going to $1 today. Lots of people were counting on it. 

Even further, a small few people own most of Doge, right? Surely they wouldn't just dump the market one day...
Well I got my doge for free in a faucet so I really don't mind if it dips
Every time I see posts about crypto, my brain goes through a rollercoaster of thoughts....aaand it ends when I realise I'm broke either way.
Of course I heard about people who lost thousands! I am them!
Probably many here have had the experience of being left holding the bag
Fishing for moons at its most terrible. Well done.
We tend to gloss over the majority of people and love to hear success stories. If you do not understand how trading works very well, you are basically gambling.
Coz they‚Äôd make shit films the big short doesn‚Äôt show you the guy who lost his house just the guy who made a billion from it
Yeah but how tf u gonna get it out
This is misleading, people didn‚Äôt drop from $1000 to $.1 unless they bought high and sold low repeatedly, seeing as how every major crypto has exploded recently the only way you‚Äôre down is if you bought and sold poorly and that‚Äôs not the cryptos fault.
The market is built on fat tailed events. Buy some and hodl. Obviously dont buy more than you can. Dont expect it to happen overnight. But buy and hodl and sell at 1000
Hahah i just find it hilarious how you can even day doge in this subreddit its comical or you will get downvoted
I had 200,000+ DOGE back before the old Coinex and Cryptsy were hacked/exitscammed/disappeared. Was left with nothing.

That was probably before it was under $0.01 or something.. and I only started buying & mining again in the past 18 months.

As for why I never bought it back: Banano is my new memecoin of choice while being 100,000x more energy-efficient... but I won't get into that here. I'm still a long way off having my former holdings though :(
I spent 10 ETH on this scam:  https://www.coindesk.com/sec-charges-shopin-ceo-with-fraud-over-unregistered-42m-ico
Some people look for opportunities on the ""Top Gainers"" list to buy in.  Bear in mind that by the time it is on the Top Gainers list the pump might be over.  Just be aware of the risks.
Buy now and HODL. Why miss out? It's not too late.
a buddy of mine got hosed by doge trading worse than ive ever seen.  panic sold and bought for a month.  ended up LOSING 10,000$ but the twist is he had enough doge that he wouldve had well over 1,000,000$ worth right now
I bought and sold about $500 of DOGE last year when it was trading at .004/cents for months.  I sold the last $50 of my DOGE coins at around .0045, for a profit of around $15.  That $500 bought around 125,000 shares in December, which x $0.643 would be worth over $80,000 now.  I didn‚Äôt lose any money but I sold before I could have made $80K.  No biggie.
no, you don't hear about that. I mean what did they buy cumrocket or something?

any of the popular coins today would be amazing investments five years ago. that's confirmed by the price today. five years from now? who knows
Who exactly?
You only end up with $0.1 if you don't hodl! #paperhands
That‚Äôs because we need a wallstreetbets version of crypto where people post loss porn
Yes you do, because of people like you who make these posts. But be realistic - people don't care about the people who turn $100 into $0.01, they want to believe they're one of the lucky ones.
I heard about not putting $1,000 into shitcoins from myself
Did you hear about me? I put 1200 in and turned it into 20k. Doesn‚Äôt help your point but I wanted to tell strangers that.
For the cost of a cup of coffee per day, you too can help out a needy memecoin investor.
[removed]
You also don‚Äôt see that these people are often the ones who forgot about their early investments and got back to them later. Easy to be diamond handed when you‚Äôre blind to the market news.
Yeh, didn‚Äôt hear about any of that. Fact is. I invested as a novelty. And the meme coin took it seriously! Made a butt load.
What you do hear is the constant whining because people are moon farming and some feel jealous about it

u can hear about it right now: i lost $134 to $DILDO.
if you want, you can hear about me not even being able to buy anything
Also if some kid has $500 to throw into a meme coin, he has a lot of money elsewhere and 500 didn‚Äôt mean what it does to a normal person.
Because its more pleasing for mind to read or get to know positive news rather than keeping your head spinning with all the bad news out there.
so  so many junk coins being spammed on r/new
Very valid point! Most of us have been in the red and even worse been in the green then held through it to end in red
true, but you will start hearing this soon as the bull market ends.  everyone that has been here before 2017 knows what is going to happen.
and all the people that put in $200 and lost their keys

I‚Äôve been in the hedge about investing in cryptocurrency or miners, but I don‚Äôt want to invest in expensive hardware that produces pennies or lose a bunch of money on a bad investment. The desire to make a quick buck is eclipsed by that little voice that says there are no get rich quick schemes that work.

this is powerful
It‚Äôs a casino what do you expect?
I mean in a world where Kylie Jenner can become billionare, anything is possible, so after enough cycles the kid who where left with $0.1 will be the kid who made millions
Treat crypto like stock. Look for value or why it would be worth something or a practical use. Haven't made a fortune, really only have my feet wet, but haven't lost money either. But I look for long term more often than not....
Sorry..

But fuck the stockmarket
25 into 400 wasn‚Äôt to bad for a return.
I mostly hear about the man that bought at .28 and sold at .48 like why the fuck didn't I just hold till Friday fuuuuck
My current 2-month exploration into CryptoCurrency specifically DogeCoin has my total cost at $254.26 with a total profit (after covering my cost) of $721.01. Now, this would have been significantly different if I wouldn't have sold 10200 Dogecoin much earlier (An emergency that caused me to have to sell almost $600 worth). This would have brought my total cost to $822.58 with a total Profit (Once again after covering my cost) of $6896.93. I started this little experiment after doing almost a year of research. Regrettably, if I would have spent that money much earlier my profits as of now would be well over twice what I make in a year. The key is to invest money you don't need. I cut out sodas and Junkfood significantly and that yields around $50 a week for me to invest into this experiment

Edit: Spelling Grammar and indicating what Cryptocoin I have invested in.
Yup
THANK YOU 

im fucking going crazy because i keep missing this shit, and i KNOW when i finally learn about it, its too late to buy it. It feels like ive lost millions of dollars because i didn't click a button the day-before-yesterday.. but i still have more than enough.. and i was happier before i started worrying about missing out on the winning lottery ticket every other hour.
SHIB Dog Millionaire!!!!
Amidst the pursuit of transparency, /u/spez's silence becomes a barricade, hindering the community's ability to find common ground and work collaboratively towards shared goals.
Put money on some coin called 8PAY but it turned out to be a scam. My money value went to 1%
I invested a bit in Doge as a temporary thing when it was 2 cents, as I predicted it going up, but I have no delusions about it being a 'good' investment. It's a dumb coin, and I have no idea who the naive wagon-jumpers are who're buying it at 70 cents, but I'm grateful to them all the same. It's gonna get to $1 and then tank forever. I've already cashed out enough to cover twice my initial investment, and I've set the rest to sell at 95 cents, as I expect it'll get that high soon, but I'll be shocked if it ever reaches $1.01. The meme is to get it to a dollar, and that's all it'll ever reach. I just feel so bad for all the millions of people who are gonna lose money on this. So many people in the Doge forum seem to actually believe that the token has longevity.
I‚Äôve turned $100 into at least $1000 more than a half dozen times in the last few months simply by finding early projects with ‚Äúcatchy‚Äù names. Not saying it‚Äôs an investment strategy or whatever but there‚Äôs plenty of money to be made in this space.
Someone‚Äôs gotta win. It‚Äôs a lottery afterall
Hold on doge, we can do it! Lets get into some money. Power to the players
? What is this post ? Dumb tbh maybe kinda of ??
The 100k profit comes from buyers who are probably too late to the show.
oh look,another salty bitch post about doge
YOLO
Still at the end of the day. Everyone who invested into dogecoin early on made huge profits. So everyone who trashed talked dogecoin on here early on is just salty. You guys missed out.
Because it is sad story :()
I feel like you have to be educated on all this, and if you aren‚Äôt you shouldn‚Äôt play. Who puts $10k into something they can‚Äôt cash out? You know this going in if your paying attention.
Rule of gambling: Set a limit and stick to it

Rule of investing: Invest what you can realistically afford

Rule 2 of Investing: Set a stop limit

The Rule of Gambling and Rule of Investing apply to Crypto. Unlike stocks though you cannot set an autosell to cut your losses. Massive fluctuations are not uncommon with Crypto and riding the wave hoping for a bounce may end with your savings in the valley.

Just be careful. Regret from cashing out early or for taking the money for something that is required is much better than losing it all.
Some1 is salty
There's shitcoins then there is just straight up scams, new coins designed to steal money.
There's been a few with smart contracts that don't allow you to sell or charge a large tax pumping the price up.
Like casinos
That‚Äôs why you should focus o  the main coins like bitcoin and hold until you make a decent amount of money.
I juts figure that‚Äôs everyone else.
That‚Äôs why you should focus o  the main coins like bitcoin and hold until you make a decent amount of money and NEVER sell at a loss.
All people I know that got into dogecoin made a profit
Holy shit someone said something smart. Everyone you know who is buying DOGE is an idiot. There are 0 exceptions.
If you mean doge, the only way anyone‚Äôs lost any $ with it is if they‚Äôve sold, it‚Äôs always recovered
Instructions unclear, put $500 into a kid. They are now offering a $100,000 reward to return him!! Success?

I turned 5 Eth into less than $100 by buying into blockarray aka freight trust. ""CEO"" Sam Bacha drained it dry and won't communicate with the community. Had a new project called Manifold Finance which is going to have a public sale soon. STEER CLEAR of that project. He got $2.5M from private investors and he's investing in early hype/marketing.
Did you hear about me turning $1000 into $30,000?
This shit has been brutal on me lately. I bought into DOGE back in 2017. I held it for two damn years and decided after all that time it just wasn't going anywhere so I sold it in July 2020 at .0045. That was 91,000 coins at .0045. My wife keeps telling me to let it go, it happens, it's part of the game but it's absolutely killing me inside knowing I missed out on almost $70,000 from my $300 investment.
What do you mean by no liquidity? Say, for example, if you use the first example, the kid would not be able to withdraw say, 50k? 
Curious
Y u make me read the same sentence twice
We turned $140 into $1500
Just for fun, I dumped 15 bucks into a couple memecoins.

I've gone between $20 and $10 more times than I can count.
Every single poster who asked about taking a loan out to by crypto in the 2017 bull run deleted their accounts.

As far as I can tell.
And you don't hear about the guy who had 59,000 Doge and sold at $60 aka me üòÇ
This and GME and AMC. People were/are lighting their life's savings on fire when they have a family to support. People who bought into the moon hype spread by those who already lost half their portfolio to try to keep their accounts afloat. These people have been spreading ""short is gonna happen this week: here's why"" bullshit. Quite frankly, it's become a cult.
Well, that kid had to take someone's money.
I had $500 in doge at $0.0017. Cashed out at $0.003. Damn
If you have billions to spare, go ahead, but otherwise it it is pretty poorly thought out. What Elon and Cuban don‚Äôt understand is..   
memes die, usually after a couple weeks.    
Surprised pikachu? Good guy Greg? Disaster girl?? All your base belongs to us??? All dead memes. The 50 new crypto coins that launched in the past 6 minutes‚Äîalready dying.
*Someone* owns a mansion off of Beanie Babies. Don't throw away your life on dumb gambling to get someone else rich.
Gave my mom $400 in Feb 2021 for Dogecoin, and she now has $5k.

I guarantee you that the \*thousands\* that put $1000 into the same coin didn't do it at the same time that the kid with $999,500 profit did; or at the very least, they didn't pull out in time.

&#x200B;

Timing is everything.
Financial FOMO is not an investment strategy.
It‚Äôs because we take our dime and keep our mouths shut about it. No one wants my dime‚Ä¶ NO ONE!
> **you don't hear about the hundreds who put $1000 and are left with $0.1**

I haven't heard 1 story where someone put in $1000 and was left with $0.1. What meme coin lost that much value? Can I hear one of these stories?  \[sits by the fireplace next to grampa\]
Hey man, you can‚Äôt loose money if you don‚Äôt sell üöÄ
True, but sometimes it's kind of frustrating to see the memecoins explode while the real projects goes down tbh.

But well, i suppose that's our burden to carry.
Seems like you hear about those people all the time.
you have to pay for a bank account?
I have sold more than 70% of my doge holding at .71 

Had put 200 bucks and it gave me 1400%+ 

Took a profit and will add into some link, dot, Ada.

It's sad a lot of people are ""holding"" doge in RH too when in reality they don't own any doge and can't transfer/spend it only sell.
I'm still holding PRL üò≠üò≠üò≠
I keep telling people how to make money but they don‚Äôt listen. 

You go back to 2013 and mine a bunch, then forget about your wallet until it‚Äôs worth something because a rich tech billionaire memes it.
What coin went to .1?
[removed]
Be safe with what you spend
That's the one kinda good thing about WSB, you're encouraged to post your losses. So its very obvious people are losing a ton of money. However I think they go a bit too far and kinda support people that make these dumb plays and lose money. Wish there was a sub where people could post about their losses and try to explain what they think went wrong with their logical, but supported but not like WSB high fives.
Unpopular opinion, doge was a meme, it was never meant to be a currency or hold any value. it is no different than reddit karma. Literally no one saw this coming and those that had a fuck ton of doge were either people who just had it for the lulz (like myself) or people who had a metric fuck ton of money to throw at it early price launch. 


This will not sustain, I can promise you this. BTC, ETH, LTC, and a few other coin have proof of concept and application for decentralized currency. Doge is just  a weird ass phenomenon. We are all chasing the dragon here, and in some cases, this too is just a casino.
No offense to anyone, because I also have no clue what I‚Äôm doing. But if you‚Äôre going off a public forum for advice on stocks, maybe it‚Äôd be good to not spend $1000 of essential money. Definitely take a risk if ya got money to throw away. And I feel like that‚Äôs what the majority of people are doing.
Can some one tell me, I never knew till just now that ""chairman of WSB"" is backing and pumping doge hard.

I mean that's it then, he's going to pump it and that's it?

Can they actually be beat... Kind of over crypto now that it's a celebrities popularity contest. Fuck..
They are all negative sum (each coin costs money- often large amounts- to produce and use and they have no intrinsic value or use outside of their own system) so the market has to be losing money- every dollar someone gains is someone else's loss PLUS whatever it takes to produce/use that coin.
I was going to buy dogecoin but I don't want to end up losing money because not FOMO
Yeah the amount of professional grade pump and dump is approaching nuclear.
It‚Äôs not a full crypto experience if you don‚Äôt learn what is Bagholding
Wait, you can lose money on meme coins? damn, tiktok vids say only to the moon!
What do you mean this thread is full of people like you telling us every five minutes
The first $100k is the hardest part.
That's the name of the game....
Dur hur doge coin to $1,000
.1 and a dream
Or turning $420 into $69!
So glad to be heard

Actually I hear about paper hand investors all the time.
Thats normal you always hear about wins same with casino , you always hear their wins about how much money they did ‚Ä¶ but how much they put in there no‚Ä¶
Yeah important reminder that people aren‚Äôt keen to share their stories of it not working out... so most of the time you‚Äôre only comparing yourself to skewed, tip of the iceberg stories.
[removed]
People keep saying stuff like this as if everyone involved doesn‚Äôt realize it. As if people don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre gambling. Those who lost money are not just some gullible suckers, they are rational actors who took a calculated risk. Can we stop acting like there‚Äôs a bunch of poor starving families out there getting evicted because they thought sh*tcoins had no risk?
you could be like me, study and obsess over crypto for years. Make a few thousand  of doge but mostly trade ETH.X, ETC.X and BTC.X. 

Buy a million doge at Xmas when Elon pumps it from half a penny to a penny and sell. Buy again on superbowl Sunday, make a few gs and figure its done.

Fast forward and while I have made a few grand profits on doge and put into other coins, I still look back and am pissed at myself for selling for $5k USD instead of near million I could have sold for a few months later.

Pissed at myself for not seeing doges potential but I am happy for the average Joe who made life changing money on a meme coin.
Lol obviously, that's how this all works, we aren't children.
I like to sports gamble...although I like it, I‚Äôm not very good at it. In fact, I‚Äôve lost a lot of money. Enough money to be ashamed over...So you know what I started doing? Every time I want to gamble I instead now buy either BTC, ETH or Chainlink....best decision I‚Äôve ever made.
This is honestly trying so hard to be bias againts dogecoin it's sad. It literally is accepted waaaay more in buisisness than any other crypto lmao. 

I get it that it is a bubble and all that but. Don't go this low lmao, you just salty cuz you can't buy under a penny no more.
*continuously slaps wrench into palm* Tell me about this kid who turned $500 into $100k...
True. And everyone needs to remember that numbers on a screen don‚Äôt mean profit or loss until you actually sell. At some point there‚Äôs gonna be a lot of pissed off people left holding a bag thinking about how they could have turned $500 into $100k if they had sold.
Ether, Christ you're so smart, look at ether. lmfao.
Buddy had $20 to $22k at .68 best gains I‚Äôve ever seen. If it hits $3 he accidentally made himself a millionaire
I got abused by some turd who told me I deserve to be poor if I refuse to invest in crypto. He must have been some kind of incel.scum, because after I explained I'm a.single mum with no expendable income, he went to posts of mine going back months ago, and made a bunch of nasty comments to me. Oh, he also offered to ""fix my financial.situation"" by giving me $10 to invest, but only if I would ""humble myself to him"" (I suspect that was something akin to the blowjobs he gets from homeless toothless prodtitutes, but I wasnt game to find out)

It was a whole ordeal
I started in June 2017 with a couple thousand dollars. Every move I made was a stroke of Genius, even the ones I lost money on. I was a financial Guru to rival Warren Buffett, eventually swinging my way to $175,000 in 6 months.

This was January '18. Retail investors were here, buying our bags. We were all going to make it.

Six months later I had lost everything on what I soon learned was actually degenerate gambling. 12.5 Bitcoin down the drain. Someone else has my $750,000 now. I had to start from scratch during the bear Market, building myself back up to just over 2 Bitcoin. I am a much more seasoned investor now, enough to recognize that I am not always going to make the right decision. I'm not always going to be able to time the top or bottom of the market. I'm only going to be able to siphon some profit out of an irrational market. My trading stack is much smaller compared to 2017, and I regularly siphoned some off to add to my Bitcoin holding, and to purchase things that I need in my day-to-day life.

My word of advice to DOGE holders, or anyone in general; if it seems too good to be true, it probably is, and you should start looking for the exits.
This is the truth.
I‚Äôm hodling Lite coin, not because I believe that it will get to the moon but because I‚Äôll just end up losing money selling. Been hodling for years and had to leave the subreddit because the whole ‚Äúkeep holding, this so just a setback; it‚Äôs going to Moon soon‚Äù stuff is not real.
im still poor asf
I got trapped in the old ZClassic to BTCP (Bitcoin Private) fork scheme, lost pretty much 80% of my ‚Ç¨2000. Lost another 10% to a staking coin called REBL that had the plug pulled, my last 10% was in ETC (I had 10). I sold my ETC last month for ‚Ç¨35 each, it hit over a ‚Ç¨100 this week...
That‚Äôs nothing I put 1,50 in Vancat token now worth 25$
Speaking of memecoins, can we get r/cryptocurrency moons to $1 after dogecoin stops pumping? Maybe get an Elon tweet. I think the whales on this sub with 100,000 moons plus would really appreciate. Hey, I‚Äôd appreciate it and I have under 3,000 moons
I hear ya, but I'm still depressed about my $5 turned $900. Like why didn't I put in $20 or something üò≠üò≠üò≠
At this point just some serious greed if you haven‚Äôt cashed out your initial doge investment. Sadly for me that was at .35 which was still 5 times the price I paid. I sometimes think if I waited even one day longer lol
I doge understand
Doge to the Moon
SCARED MONEY DONT MAKE NO MONEY
I was trying to buy safe Moon somehow I ended up with 100 bucks in ethereum classic. Ended up being worth $800. My best returns were an accident.
[removed]
I turned my 2k into 20k, so ya it's worked well for me so far.
Gotta question, what if I just let my $10 sit there? How will I know about the liquidity problem you brought up as I'm uneducated in it?
I got into an argument on reddit years ago. I was convinced bitcoin would not replace currency. A guy who was convinced bit coin would become money, not just a fancy collectible, tipped me through a reddit app a fraction of a bitcoin. I sold that before the last bitcoin for  427 dollars.
I'm still waiting for bitcoin to become money, though.

How to avoid this - don‚Äôt sell at the dip
Im ready to put in my 2 week notice on Monday with my 20 doge.  Go back to school and finish my degree.
Nice
^

This man has a STORY.
I thought about this crypto stuff. I really needed to see this post!  At the start of the pandemic, I moved all my 401k into *stable-value fund* (I guess that means its not invested, but just sitting there?). I don't understand investing at all. My company matches us up to 8%. At 50+ I had about 450K. I was at 300K when I panicked & moved the $. Everyone who didn't touch it rode the wave right back to where they were before the drop. My dumb ass has no idea what to do now. I guess I could go back to the previous elections. I was getting \~15 to 20 % returns.  I was thinking about this crypto stuff but I'm the dummy who would lose his shirt...
You don't hear about me turning 30 soon with 30 years of wisdom.
True, good perspective. Everything looks like a no-brainer looking backwards
Very well said
The biggest thing to remember is to invest only money you can afford to lose. I took the gamble of investing in ETH when it was 700 and again at 1000. I held my 2 coins through the bubble crash and now I‚Äôm up. No plans to sell anytime soon. If it goes bust that‚Äôs okay but if it goes the way of BTC and hits 50k I‚Äôll be ready to cash out!!
What? Which coins did this poorly and why would anyone invest that much in them? For people who don't follow crypto closely like myself, Im only familiar with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin. Wouldn't have even invested in doge but was bored at work one day and my coworkers all discovered Robinhood and figured what the hell why not throw $10 in the trash. Confused as hell as to why my 10 is now 1k but I'll take the free money... Thought it wasn't even a ""real"" currency.
Only ever invest what you are willing to loose.
I was telling a bunch of Crypto dummies that someone needs to lose for you to gain. Crypto is like stocks where you invest in hopes of getting a bigger return.
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single point you could‚Äôve put your money into dogecoin , the main meme coin, in the last two years and pulled your money out for 1 ten thousandth of your starting money. You‚Äôd have to be very aggressively day trading incredibly poorly to get those ‚Äúreturns‚Äùif you‚Äôve stayed in until now then the only time you could‚Äôve invested and lost is literally earlier today lmao, and I promise you wouldn‚Äôt be down to 1/10,000
You heard about the person who started a company and became a billionaire but you don't hear about the millions who start companies and go broke 

Or the millions in poverty

Or the millions struggling to make ends meet

Or the millions who are consumed by these products and services

Your argument goes for everything and anything
But did you hear about the kid who made millions after he learned about deflationary currency through HOGE.finance
I turned $20 at $0.03 into $172 at $0.27 on dogecoin. Yeah, it‚Äôs be more if I had stayed in, but it‚Äôs a meme coin, and I had zero confidence in it.
[removed]
FUN FACT...

the only people who put in 1k to a meme coin and are left with .01 didn't invest in DOGE
Everyone of us after our first bear market.
This
doubled my investment in Shitcoin in my country, and then the bubble burst. $2 to $5 :3
Me! It's me!! I lost like $200-$250  in Doge I can't exactly remember now.
Yea well I turned a penny into half a penny, beat that!
I am both of these people
i made 3 cents
Moral of the story is don't buy into hype.
Clearly you haven‚Äôt been on wallstreetbets lol
You also don't hear about the guy who put a malware and $10 Million.

You know I‚Äôm somewhat of an investor myself.
Thank you. I needed to hear this
I needed to hear this thank you
I turned $250 into $5K on ETC, took most out of ETC right before the dip and bought ETH and staked some ETH 2.0. 
I‚Äôm not mad about that at all. Literally gave me the ability to buy into a better coin. 
I haven‚Äôt put a lot in, but man that was a game changer. Grateful.
How did you get so many awards for spouting such crap...not even disinformation, straight up crap. Can't cash out because it's memecoin? Lmfao what?...tell your ass thanks for the info.
Yeah you do.
I put 124 i made about 450$, money is money i made profit i am happy
Crypto is a zero sum investment. Stocks and other investments that produce cash flow are not zero sum investments. But commodities and crypto are zero sum.
Ok i did beat myself because i pulled out at 5 cents at dogecoin and its as high as it is now ... i missed out on thousands. On the other hand though im grateful i broke even basically
Oh people TRY and talk about it.  Every time there is a dip there is a post on this sub that goes something like ""Shut up new people.  If you cant take 100% drop in your portfolio get out of crypto!!""

Then a few days later there is a post about ""Be nice to new people"".
I once yoloed 20k in FB 1 day to expiry calls and lost it all
Be it crypto or stocks, someone has to lose in order for you to gain. Pretty much the loser pays your earnings while ur loss funds the next winner
*Survivorship bias is a dangerous thing.*

I was trying to move ETH from MetaMask using Kovan test network and the transaction says successful. However, it‚Äôs not showing up in my wallet. Is there a way to retrieve those?

I'm too poor to afford losing what I have.
I purchased VET at 0.05 and now it‚Äôs 31c
Can you not cash out doge?
Never invest more than you can afford to lose...
It was $639.00 in y case and the take was $11k, not $10k
I lost 700k selling naked gme calls
Not to mention the fact that people that made such gains did the initial investment as a complete joke and completely forgot about it till the pump.
you also don't hear about people who's account got locked on Binance for no reason and support never progressed their case, but we're coming!
This belongs in r/selfawarewolves
Right now I'm hearing about SHIB.
You also don't hear about turning my $500 and sold for $1000. After few days, that project went parabolic. It's like they just waiting me to sell my bags before lifting off.
Have u not been on wsb. Those apes be losing money daily.

Fuck man, thanks. I feel like shit every coin I called before is up as fuck. I was in neo at 15, dot at $3, fucking Bitcoin at 10k, but no BALLS to go all in. I‚Äôm not losing matic though, time to quadruple down. Been in since .17. No guts no glory. Best to all
Or it seems like you don't hear about people who put $10 in, it goes to several thousand, but then they think it will get even higher, and people don't sell out of fear of losing out even more money, and then the prices crashes and they get nothing.
I'm still waiting for my bbqcoin to take off.
Am I the only one that realizes that every single time a new cripto becomes available to buy on coinbase that they all have gone up hundreds of percent over the previous month leading up to being able to buy on coinbase. Don‚Äôt tell me that people don‚Äôt know ahead of time . You know insider trading on news it will be on coinbase soon. I‚Äôm telling you every one. One came out today and it‚Äôs flying today 40 percent but 400 percent for the past month before coming available. The 40 is for new coinbase buyers but that‚Äôs bull crap that everyone that‚Äôs new goes up so much before the official announcement.
Always invest what you're willing to lose!
ROFL
Wait you can't cash out meme coins?
You don't know what other people hear about.
I waited a year with a coin that never moved, but I didn't lose hope. Turned my 3.6k into 18k in a month or two though. 

Patience and a little wisdom gets you quite far.. I'm in it for the long game.
I‚Äôve made 6$ off a 4.70 investment. Seems cool. Also terrifying if I had invested more. Also terrifying because I‚Äôve seen people literally lose everything and become homeless

Stop selling at a loss? If you can't watch it loose value you shouldnt invest that money
Oh you do, but you have to search.  We call it loss porn.

Actually friend's 17year old brother actually threw in $800 and TEL and he made $100,000.
Check out Shiba Inu. Buy millions of coins for under $20 it will be the next Doge been up as much as 500% in the last 24 hrs
I have 100k Fuck tokens so I have 100k of something. I got that going for me
I've been day trading ETH and XLM for 3 weeks and I'm up $48. I put $100 in originally, still have $100 in because when I sell I transfer the profits to my regular stocks account... Sure had I just held this whole time I'd be up more but I'm happy with having 48% more money in 3 weeks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Why would I want to hear about such losers?
I'm still up a few hundred percent.

Anybody with knowledge on DeFi tokens feel like teaching me how to buy things with smaller Network Fees? I spent 0.01846 ($71.69, nice) in ETH to purchase 0.006 ($21.01) of a small market cap DeFi Token. 

How can DeFi tokens be sustainable when network fees are this high, and how is that an attractive market? BTC/LTC holder since 17 dipping my toes in the ETH side of the market.
I turned 500 into 2200 in about two months with dogecoin.

I have zero clue why it turned from a 1 cent coin to a 70 cent coin, I sold early April.

Do not ever believe in the hype, there's no justification for it sometimes, and that's dangerous.
What meme coin left you with $.1 after a $1000 investment?
OF course you do...they're all on reddit.
You also don't hear about the ppl plowing millions into meebits and got no rare ones, because they have nothing to brag.
Lmao I literally read up on it and said fuck it. Bought up 1.3 million shib just for the giggle. If it hits 0.01 I've earned 13k.
You‚Äôre really worried about memecoins out of everything to be critical about?
Considering I can't even get into my app, I just hope my 500 meme investment is still there in the morning.
Damn you guys are so salty it's hilarious. Literally can taste the salt with my tongue and it tastes good.
You're about to....
I spent $600 and have over $3K. Thanks DoGE
Turned 1200 into 6800 ü¶çü¶çü¶ç

This is stupid though, never invest with money that you can't afford to lose
What about the people who make (essentially) riskless 60% interest on pancakebunny, heard about those? (BUSD or USDT staking.) among other riskier higher interest ones =)
The fomo is real though
Thats how shitcoins works in crypto. 1 will give you x100, other 99 will give you -99%
For once I actually have that kinda story. Not 100k

I put in $20 in doge for jokes. It's worth over $1.5k now.
r/CryptoCircleJerk
I agree, it's just like gambling.
when you say no liquidity what do you mean? like if its on pancake swap can't you always just convert it to something like BNB and then easily turn that into USD? the idea of not being able to get your money out is scary...
The vast majority of people putting money into memecoins and most crypto lose money. 

It‚Äôs the same story for those who buy individuals stocks trying to beat the market because of FOMO.

People buy crypto as an investment but really it‚Äôs like buying a lottery ticket - just with better odds of winning.
Oh...yes you do..have you been over to r/dogecoin yet?? Porn loss everywhere...
Uhh yeah. Are you new to society?
Same with the stock market. Even someone in net negative will boast about his gains and not his losses.

ICO is the most non risky way. At least one or two of them you invested, will shine. Was hyping in 2017, and now again. If you cash out, i exceeds all different investment you did. Ok, it's not real trading. This is the way of doing nothing.
If I ever hear that I should invest in a certain product I know not to because they wouldn't say it if they had nothing to gain
Because someone had buy that coin for 75 cents.
Does this remind anyone of Elf on a Shelf? ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen crypto - BUT‚Äù lol
Well i made 20$$ on my 200$ in 5 months.
Who's really giving up dollars for these coins lmao.
Moon pumping all day with the meme coins. If I dont see 10+ paid Dogecoin adds before the end of my shift I will eat my shirt.

lol and there are a few who have done both of those
The real untold story is when you convert $500 into $1000 and then your reality splits where one version of you just sells half and chills and the other version sells small then when consolidation hits, doubles down and then pulls out all hair when everything comes crashing down
And you don't hear the story of me buying a physical BitCoin. Anyone wanna buy it off me for $1000?
I lost a few thousand on the scam $TNC.  I'm slowly building back what I lost but it's not easy as I got burned pretty bad and refuse to put any cash into crypto.  I learned that sports betting is a better ROI if you know what you're doing.

I'm waiting till a certain meme coin his 1$ and hopefully get my 800 back lol
This whole year got a little overboard for me. I stopped following all this meme stock/crypto because I always thought why didn't you do it and stuff like that. Felt pretty bad. If I would have done something like doge or gme I would have probably left with 0$.
Truer words have not been spoken
Its like no one ever tells you they are shit at betting. Or that they are a bad dog owner or bad driver. Or that they were the bad partner in a relationship...its just not the done thing!
Thanks, i need that some times
That's how Ponzi schemes work
And now this post is full of cryptocurrency success stories. Ironic! 

I do think it can make good money but I'm so worried for the environmental issues it causes though
I turned $4.96 into $70
With any investment there is someone loosing money for every dollar someone is making. It is a 1 to 1 relationship. With crypto investments the person loosing money is the person selling as the popularity and price drops. A good thing to remember for any investment stockmarket or otherwise. 

For long term dividend stocks the money is coming from customers.
The example I always come back to was an atheist philosopher in Ancient Greece iirc. When presented evidence that seafarers who prayed to the gods were never killed by a storm he replied ‚Äúwell show me all those who prayed and sunk to the bottom of the sea!‚Äù

You would get banned for posting this in r/bitcoin
Turned 160 in 2000 cashed out yesterday
So many people miss this. This is all paper gains/losses. There are fees, taxes, etc involved in al these speculations that they simply don‚Äôt disclose because that would be to honest and real. We‚Äôre being forced to put money into a market that we do not control and I‚Äôm not okay with that. Cool your stock doubled? How much are the taxes and fees if you wanted to access your money? Dividends? Hahaha
Not enough liquidity for a whale to sell millions of doge coins today?
Welcome to investing.
Lmao what a dumb post.
this is the same I'm repeating everyday on twitter, most will lose this lottery anyway.

this is how its played, in Vegas works like that. 

House always wins.
So, serious question by someone on the outside:  
Seeing the top posts and stuff I see from these surbreddits and communities, this whole ""reddit doing stonks"" thing looks very unhealthy and culty. 

What are the impressions of those on the inside? Is there some truth to that?
This you 2d ago? https://np.www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n6t503/serious_question_why_are_you_guys_so_salty/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
I got out at $0.40, it started sketching me out
Turned $170 into 17k within 3 weeks but 95% of the time you're losing it, essentially it's roulette with these pumps and dumps meme coins (Spore Finance) in my case, bought 9 Trill worth $170

Me who put $300 and got $10üòè buy high sell low
[removed]
I've done my first foray into crypto and I'm up $700. Not too shabby.
You also don't hear that you can get one of these Elon Musk's [dogecoin](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094H4L9LR) definition tee ü§£
It really is as simple as 1. Buy and 2. Hold, thus far.
I turned my 3000 to 25000 with eth
Thing I don't understand is why people are investing in a crypto currency if they haven't ever traded a standard currency,stock or a commodity ...get some years under your belt before you get into trading anything live or if you dont want to fuck with a demo then go very small .. the key to trading isn't risk management contrary to most people's beliefs but it's a good start üòä....you won't be in this game long risking too much it's really not for the faint hearted ....but stick with it and really learn how to properly chart you trades out and you will thank yourself later believe me...
True that.
I have turned my 3200 dollars to 1700. After months of sweat and tears, I'm finally at -400 from where I started. Risks can pay off, but they also can lose you a lot.
Probably because no one would tell people they went into the market and lost that much, but a win like that would be shared to the mountains üòÇ
Sell the dip, lick the tip
Doesn‚Äôt happen
How about the guy who made $2500 on one Reddit post
I put $0.01 down as an initial investment.  Lost everything....
Yup been there... my portfolio was -95% for nearly four years. I'm finally back in green but jeez, that's some serious PTSD.
One's news and the other isn't.....
Who is stupid enough to catch out on a loss of $999.99 you sound salty af. Anyone would just hold.
I mean Im up $5,000 first time I've ever put money into any stock üòÜ talk all the shit you want but Im still holding DOGE
I wonder how many of those who have been burned badly by Crypto will have returned and played it safer the 2nd time round. If you invest in meme coins you deserve everything you get out of that shit imo
not learning about liquidity isn't really anyone's fault but their own, im a novice investor and liquidity was one of the first things that occurred to me with some of these 'assets'

also how would you go from 1,000 to 0? someone held through a 100% loss?
Should have held then.
Already seeing the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm down 5-6 figures‚Äù over in r/dogecoin. And they still don‚Äôt get it. Delusion are hard to break.
People should do a research and decide on a strategy to avoid FOMO and decision in panic.

But... You don't hear about people who put 1000$ and left with 0.1$, because it never dipped anywhere close to this. 500$ is much closer to true numbers than 0.1$.

Edit: Ofc this is about Doge, I despise all other coins that try to go up on Doge's hype.

Edit 2: And no, there aren't much more people who lost a lot of money on Doge than people who earned a lot. The numbers don't add up. Even 500$ I mentioned is with an assumption that SO MANY people bought at ATH and then sold at the deepest dip. After SNL it didn't even (so far) dip  to 50% of ATH, so 500$ is too low number even in extreme cases.
Someone stole this word for word and put it on showerthoughts lol
If any community should know this it would be this one.. that crypto is volatile??? 
This memecoin has become popular in like the last 2 seconds. You don‚Äôt lose unless you liquidate. People shouldn‚Äôt expect to get rich over night and others shouldn‚Äôt be spreading negativity towards another coin. Like for what? You can get your bag too??
So your saying only start with $500 and I‚Äôll be a winner?
$1000 into a penny?! That‚Äôs some skill idk htf you do that üëÄ
That's when people suicide..
Invested 2.4k in 2017 when btc was $1800 and eth was around $20-60. I lost it all trying to hit big in altcoins that year instead of holding for a few years. Hindsight is 20/20 man.
This is a zero sum game. For every winner there‚Äôs a loser
This has aged quite well
Still just have my original $6.00 investment I put into doge in 2017, haven't put anything more in. Obviously wish I put $1000 or something, but definitely can't complain. Was just putting a couple bucks here and there to see what would happen. Mana and Neo did pretty good for me as well, well others definitely did not.

DD and done!
You only lose money if you sell...
Duh
Cashing out all of my shitcoins and going to invest in real crypto. ADA and ETH the way to go?
Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt happen if they knew how to buy these coins and properly sell, people never give you the proper guidance on these things
I put 7k into an investment and walked away with 3K. 

Take my advice - don‚Äôt listen to me.
You c ant have a debt to the universe! There.....
U don‚Äôt hear about me turning 750$ into 13k
Bahahaha! Sucks to be you!
I just got in not to long ago and watched 1000usd turn into 920 in a day, after transfer fees and market shifts. 

But after all my research that USD is better off there than inflating and ""gaining"" 1.5% rotting in savings.

Been lurking for over a year, feels good to move the chips in finally.
And I am up 2000% because I don‚Äôt listen to you paperhands üòÇüòÇüòÇ
We all like a good story.
I honestly feel like a lot of these people investing into cryptos are going to lose their shirts. In most unregulated markets there‚Äôs only space for one competitor, which appears to be Bitcoin. Ask yourself, what‚Äôs the functional reason for Ethereum or Dogecoin to exist beyond speculation?
Yeah man etherium and Bitcoin need to be stoppedüòÇ
I thought crypto was supposed to be the alternative to standard fiat, not its little hedge funding bitch
My Doge is going to make me rich ü§£ü§£ü§£
Well, my friend put 500$ in shiba 3 months ago and now she is sitting on $ 1 M. Meme/shitcoin are like any other cryptos IMO. The earlier you get in ,the more you gain. Only difference is they have no fundamentals. Otherwise it works the same.
Doge to the moon haters get fucked
Lol no ine hears about me who out 70‚Ç¨ and got 99.98‚Ç¨
Still happy that I turned $150 into $1500
Bought in at .008 and now have realized over $18000 ü§∑

I had it up to $25,560 last week.

Is 29 a kid? Tell that to my fuckin' back hahaha
explains where that kid's 100K came from.
Lost 5500 euros trying to mine the bottom of ETH in 2018. Thank God I didn't stay around for $80 per coin.

Btw Ethereum usage isn't up since then: [https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-activeaddresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-activeaddresses.html) Idk wtf people are doing with their money.
from 10 bucks to 12 bucks im really feeling the btc drip
Anyone not securing their initial investment are just a dummy
I took 20k profits out of doge before SNL and reinvested. The remaining 80k can ride, I got more than my money back anyway *shrug*
I turned $300 into $3000 in 2 days on the crap coins. Lol
You'll never hear about me if i don't start putting down some money ü§£
Gotta say been dragging in the ETH gains non-stop
simp
Too many noobs, that's the problem.
Hmmm
Mmhh ... maybe this subreddit isn't as bad as I thought (huge crypto skeptic)
Congrats, this post should get you about 60 moons.
So all these shit coins, cant actually be cashed out for their 1000x Gains? Some people keep saying so but I hve yet to see proof. Maybe shiba Inu u can actually convert back as it listed on major platforms. But honestly I don‚Äôt know!!! Any ideas

Cost nothing to hold
Great post
Margin trading up a rebound is so fricking yummy
We need to stop promoting HODL culture for all and only HODL culture for those who can afford it. The Dogecoin daily discussion has a suicidal mentality in terms of money standing.
I know a few who lost on this. Buying high, panicking and selling low. It's easily done if you're new to it.

Not a rich quick. You buy, hold (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year... ect.) until your up a good amount. Buy on dips when can. Do your research. But never sell at a loss.
I never had $1000 when I was a kid
I bought etc when it was like 40 bucks a pop sold at 150 so not bad made a g off of like 400 bucks

A little over a year ago I have about $25 worth of doge. Then I sold and closed my Robin Hood account. Cause, fuck Robin Hood.
I‚Äôm here ¬£1000 into Shiba, now worth ¬£450.

I fomo‚Äôd hard on this one
I completely pulled out of Shib, it's not worth the stress over 20 fucking bucks.

I bought a #butterflyLabs 5gh/s with all the Bitcoin I mined in 2011 so I could mine more coins faster but by the time I got the ASIC it was cheaper to just buy the coin than to mine IT... 
But did I even buy some (2013)

No I did not.
I turned 100 bucks into 2k. But i still gotta work soo waaaah!
It's just a big piramid scheme.
What?
They all gave it to the kid
Sounds like something a hater would say. Do only good everyday baby!! Doge to the moon. And everyone is welcome on the rocket.
Very well said OP! That‚Äôs exactly what happened to me. I heard those stories. I bought at ATH because of FOMO. Then kept losing $100 every day since last Wednesday. Almost losing $800 now. Such a hard lesson. Please warn those new inexperienced investors. Even you treat this as a gamble, start small and test it out.
Worth the risk

Last 30 minutes-ish. 1 minute candles. Bitcoin. Descending bullish channel?

I learned all about liquidity with POL on kucoin. Anyone can be a whale with that one. If you want to buy a lot youve gotta take your time, watch the order book, don't flood in all at once, because if you do you'll move that price quick and people will run with your money. Once you are in however it will randomly shoot up from some dumbass whale with tens of thousands of dollars who just a market buy order and if you're watching it when this happens you can absolutely sell all your POL and make a killing. It's so slimey. It feels exactly like steeling from someone. I went from 6k to 20k in 2 weeks doing it though. It has since fizzled out. 

Anyways, the point is with no liquidity the amount it says you have in your wallet (estimated in usdt) is pointless. If you have enough of it, by the time you got done unloading it you'd have lowered the price on yourself. Volume is key. Always have someone there to buy your coins
I bought some dog money.  Husky and ASS and Shiba Inu and Leash.  Now they‚Äôre worth dog shit.
I've just developed Cat Coin. The little old lady down the road has invested her entire life saving in it. TO THE MEOW... sorry, I mean MOON!
You could say that about any coin or stock for that matter, especially on long term compared to short term.
I‚Äôm gonna put 10k in a meme coin. Which one
I seen coins go up 10000% in just two days it‚Äôs always been like that I started buying crypto late 2017 and been rob by a few of them in the likes of bitconnect  or titanium shit like that and I have never sold a crypto for a profit I still holding all my coins I‚Äôm up a few k and I fact I just give it away to my kids
I bought $50 in doge before SNL then cash out before the drop for $55! 10% sounds good and then I found $20 on the floor so I‚Äôm up $25 üòÅ
Yes you do. 3 years ago. If you're dipping in without much care of doing DD by now it's really no fault but user error at this point in time.

Theres SO MANY stories you can youtube right now of people losing entire life savings in 2018.
Yes. Seem people forgot that one man win come from lot of other losses

Turned 950 to 2220 and sold with DogeCoin, hope to do it again
I put 100 into Shiba when it came out and got to 45k. 
Pulled out at 28k and bought into a few others and now have about 1.5 eth left. Lmfao! It's wild how this shit goes.
Literally this whole week is devoted to the opposite. Someone even as stupid to think Elon was spending his personal time asking a rando teacher for 9k in crypto.
I thought I was smarter than the Dogecoin fools and put my money into Bitcoin. GREAT CHOICE üò≤ü§£
That the great things that can make magic in your port when you buy a coin that actually pumps. Just like I bought Smitty coin and fyz by fyooz in uni swap. I'm much confident in this new coin that is really underrated but truly a hidden gem

I just turned my $8.21 on futures with x125 leverage to 17.10 in 20 seconds.
But then i tried again.
Now you know.
True to this comment, I read through those posts on cryptomoonshots on the other sub reddit and they are just over hyping those new meme coins.
The thing is. People follow hype. Never chase a runaway stock or crypto. Do due diligence, understand what and why one is investing. Try not to buy in on fomo. The other thing is plan to hodl and diamond hand. This is not financial advice. I eat crayons all day long.
500 in 11k out doge
I turned my 2700 chump change into 58k with doge and reinvested it
WeBULL doesn't allow Crypto trading between the hours of 17:30 and 18:30...such  BULL crap

They will cancel a buy or sell that you have set at 17:30 (5:30 pm) Twice now I've had a price hit my buy or sell point but it wouldn't execute Twice now. 
Thoughts? Why?
I just put down 13k on a coin one of my best friends has a lot of confidence in and I'm down 9k. I'm not stressed, you're stressed.
How much did a post like this net 50k upvotes in moons? Not to mention the awards. This isa nuts
Thank you
I'm that kid thank god
I think certain types of people are more inclined to take risk.If I only have $500 to my name I might as well invest it in something that could make me $500k what is 500$ really going to do for you after 3 days it's gone.

Further more some people like me feel like there's always ways to make more money if you blow it all on onething make more and try something else.

I went to several friends with investment ideas they where all to scared,and wanted to play it safe.So I did it on my own and no regrets.
Today im buying pizza wich will be payed by fiat, because my crypto thumbled so savage i cant even afford a Tic Tac  with it.

Good point.  Thank you.
I bought 11,000 doge at 0.004 over a year ago then lost about half cos of daft exchange delays. The 6000 coins were worth over $4000 last week. Now they are worth $1700ish. Im happy holding cos I think long term it will go up. Part of me is kicking myself for not selling at .70 though
Thanks for this!
I hate the rags to riches story because they are so ridiculous and everything you shouldn't do. People put what is a relatively significant amount of money in an extremely risky investment. Then they get extremely lucky and it pays off. They are up 200-300x now they have a really significant relatively life changing amount of money and they're like ""nah lets keep playing and don't lock in any of their gains.

 It's like playing the lottery every day, one day winning, and deciding to spend all your winnings on more lottery cards.

It doesn't reflect reality at all.
I just heard about a dude taking a second mortgage. So sad. 

It'll be back. But if you thought a jump like that was to the moon in any way that would justify a second mortgage I have a coin that was literally made as a joke to sell you...

Wait a second ...
150$ to 83$ so far. 

Haven't figured out all the fees. Pretty sure I'm going to lose the rest on fees.
I think it's gonna fall to the low 20s tbh before it goes high

I'm not rich and I invested in January and February a little at a time and got over 20k doge and I haven't lost anything. I'm up several thousand and don't plan on cashing it out for quite a while. It's kind of good I'm beginning to gamble a little more because this actually seems like a better investment than the casino, it just takes a little more time. It's almost a savings plan... not a get rich quick scheme like some keep trying to push. Don't forget it took Bitcoin YEARS to get to where it is now...
Next coin #stopelon
I turned 23k to 30dlls... fuck me right?
The thing is that crypto markets are a negative sum game, someone has to loose money in order for someone to make money. Even if there was a 0$ fee for trades or blockchain transactions, the best you can hope for is a zero sum game which still needs people looking money to have people earning money
You can literally say the same for anyone who goes to Vegas
You hear about it all the time. Media always saying we will lose our money. Watch mad money. Most ppl know the risks but if you have been broke your whole life and have one shot at big gains your gna take that risk.

I made many mistakes early doors, from going through brokers that would call at 3am to go to an exchnage from fiat to crypto, whereby I'd lose loads in the handling.

Move on to swapping crypto to stable, to my local, to fiat and losing because I didn't realise that a lot have pairs direct to my fiat currency.

At one point I even transferred eth from an exchnage to a broker then to fiat because I didn't realise I could withdraw direct to fiat from the exchnage.

After all those lessons learnt, I'm happy to say I've taken an $8000 investment to $60,000 in four years, taking profit along the way.

I'd love more, but I still hold down a full time job and have a family. I don't check the charts everyday and I dca my portfolio picks with $50 a month, no more, no less. 

Don't be afraid to make mistakes, learn from them and always take a bit of profit from time to time, you owe it to yourself.

Who's the kid?
Sometimes I wonder if investing in a Meme coin like Doge or Shiba of Akita or whatever Inu is worth it.  You look at the amount of tokens and it is insane.  I‚Äôd rather now invest in coins like NKN with low volume‚Äî this way when it picks up it is explosive growth and can hold well.

No pump to be had there
Yeah there's a part of me concerned I'll lose everything I put into various coins but I went into it with the mindset of what I was willing to lose. Sure it'll suck but at the end of the day it isn't going to break the bank for me.
Annnnnnnnd here goes by first comment on this sub. I usually do not post a lot üòÖ
Retail investing and the opening up of crypto from a shady, niche market limited to a select few tech savvy enthusiasts into something anybody with a phone can get into is definitely neat. Democratizing finance and trade is a wonderful thing. It enables average joe to get in on the games that made the titans of industry into what they are.

It also allows some broke ass minimum wage subsistence level earner to blow his rent on something he saw memes about on reddit and make his situation way, waaaaay worse.

Bottom line, don't invest anything you can't afford to lose. If you are sitting there saying ""aw geeze, should I pay my bills and buy groceries for the week or put another $500 onto some shit-coin?"" the answer is, pay your damned bills and buy groceries.
Even if people get in now it is never too late. The price will always eventually go up over the years.
Of course people only talk about all the success stories everybody wants to hear. Not many people enjoy talking or reading about money they lost. I do like reading people‚Äôs mistakes so I can learn from them.
Guys let's create a mirage, let's all look at the charts upside down and convince ourselves it is real.

I have the same level of sympathy for someone who spends $1000 on lottery tickets I don't expect much if anything from the memecoins I hodl
People only hear what they want to hear
The lesson here is to put in $500 if you want to profit instead of $1000.

Every big winner also means there was a big loser. Remember that
People such as myself who are, should I say average, who were taught the value of money growing up and being without, whether its ¬£0.1 or ¬£100, I was taught the value of  it's worth.
I was naive and jumped the shib hype train in hopes it would act like doge just out of sheer stupidity of what those coins are, a joke. But even though I only spent ¬£50 and knew that it was going to be a written off investment, because of its volatility, knowing it will probably fail. I still feel butt-hurt that what I put in is only worth ¬£15 now.

But that's how media works
You see the success of the minority but are blind to the suffering and loss of the majority.
Then the tunnel vision commences and situations like myself happen regardless of me being aware of the above situation.

My sympathies go out to all those who dumped their savings  in hopes for a better life.

We see them in the mirror every morning.
That's the thing. He put it in way before there was any sign of getting a rally as large as this. For most putting in 2300 would be a really high risk. 

He was already wealthy. So 2300 is pocket change to him like a dollar would be to most of us.

Except that dollar would grow to maybe a thousand, hardly life changing money but he racks in a million.

Rich get richer example
Damn. Wow.
Do you mean four or five years ago? A quick look at the charts shows that 2300 -> 1200000 is impossible unless you go much further back than 4-5 months. That or he used a lot of leverage.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of claims of Dogecoin millionaires lately, or people who know a guy who knows a guy who became a Dogecoin millionaire. It‚Äôs important to remember that to be a Doge millionaire you‚Äôd either need to have invest thousands many years ago, or invested tens or hundreds of thousands recently.
He must have put more than that in, I bought over a year ago and it hasn't been that low since, if I would have spent 2300 at the time and cashed out at the absolute peak it would be about 900k
LOL. Even if your buddy invested $2,300 in Dogecoin at $0.01 in January 2021 and somehow magically sold it for $0.6 this May which would be a Prophet level prediction he would still got $138,000. This is still amazing but a farcry from $1.2M.
Safemoon. You‚Äôve been told. Don‚Äôt whine when it hits big and you didn‚Äôt invest.
I call BS. 5 months ago at best he would have 100x not 500x his returns.

In December price was 0.003 and 500 times that becomes 1.5 price per coin.

So I say to you sir/ma'am either you're BSing or you don't know math
Well if you didn‚Äôt have millions you‚Äôd be sensible to not invest 2300 on doge.
Cool story bro...u do know the math doesn't add up right?
I read that the little nerds at Litecoin where bidding it up.
Welp, it definitely did something!
He didnt put in 2300 and cashed out at 1.2 mil.. your numbers are wrong
Sure. That's called gambling and it won in this instance. There is no way in the world anyone could have known that musk would shill that coin like he has and if he hadn't that would have been money lost. I thought LTC had had massive gains incidentally.
At least you didn't trade 65k doge into eth late November because it looked dead as hell after holding it for nearly 3 years at a net loss.
You know why he could do that? I think lots of ppl underestimate the impact of wealth on ones behavior. He already got several Ms to mess around. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôd have the courage to do this YOLO. He just got nothing to lose. Rich gets richer.
Would you drop 2.5 k into shiba inu?
I Probably would if I had that mind of money to fritter away.

Most people don't.
Wow he must've timed the very bottom and sold it pretty much at the very top.... What a skillful person....

I did some calculation and based on my math even if he bought it 9 months ago, $1.2m is impossible from $2300 invested on doge. Math doesn't check out unless he kept pouring money throughout or if this was his total realized profit from other cryptos
LTC is a shitcoin
@DopeMeme_Deficiency I feel you bro, I diversified my portfolio equally between btc, eth, and ltc.  LTC is the worst performer in my wallet.
It's okay, definitely there with you. Was going to put in a grand before the hype, but never came around to it as I didn't want to download another app. *cries inside
I mean I feel you on the LTC (definitely a stash that I have faith in) but you're totally full of crap on this $2300 story. 7 months ago to the top and value Doge 0.0033, 2300x 240 is only 552k assuming he timed perfectly and sold the top within minutes.

There's a reason it took the Dogecoin millionaire $200,000+ to get to over a million dollars. 

I'll give you credit for the story being entertaining. At least you dropped the story before Doge dropped back down to 16 cents.
üòÇ
That's cap, you can only make that 500x on doge coin if you bought it like 2 years ago stop
I call bs on that one.

Lowest dodge was sold at 0,02$. With an initial Investment of 2300$ your buddy woulf have bought 115.000 dodge (if he bought them at the all time low). At all time high dodge was like 0.6‚Ç¨ p/c which would have made him 57.5k at the absolute highest‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.  You guys are just story stellers üòÖ
Being in crypto for even just the last six months has been a whack-a-mole for getting rich and I really suck at it. I thought I was making a ‚Äúsmart capital move‚Äù selling my million doge at a penny. Fml
Dude that is completely fucking impossible unless he was using leverage. Either that or you have your timing way fucking off
U mean 23,000?
Lol
Sorry but 2300 a few months ago would not have netted 1.2 mil.
Lol, he did NOT do that 4 or 5 months ago with only $2,300 but I do understand your point. Lol
One time I turned 5$ into 11$ by day trading doge on robinhood. Hit me up for financial advice.

Edit: I didn't think that many people would actually ask me for financial advice. Please don't. I'm just a random idiot who got into crypto a year ago and is still trying to make sense of this space.

Like yeah but they dropped out of *Harvard*, their ideas were products with traction already, and you're ignoring millions of college dropouts who had....less successful outcomes.

Their backup plan was go back to Harvard; if yours is not comparably privileged then you are not making the same risk-assessment that they did.
if anyone does not know what survivorship bias means (like me);

>Survivorship bias or survival bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to some false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of selection bias.  
>  
>Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance. It can also lead to the false belief that the successes in a group have some special property, rather than just coincidence (correlation ""proves"" causality). For example, if three of the five students with the best college grades went to the same high school, that can lead one to believe that the high school must offer an excellent education when, in fact, it may be just a much larger school instead. This can be better understood by looking at the grades of all the other students from that high school, not just the ones who made the top-five selection process.

It is the key foundation of MLMs.
People who lose don't post about losing. It can get terribly depressing. 


 And people who win do. You know, because they won.


People usually don't upvote posts about losing, only if it's funny or interesting.


People like to upvote posts about winning, because they like to think of themselves in that same position or something like that.
Yes but this isn‚Äôt it. Doge is a zero sum game as are all stocks, coins, and any collectible. Survivorship bias would be if he was talking about all Cryptos even the ones that failed. I don‚Äôt know of any meme Cryptos that failed. 

So like if you only thought of beenie babies and didn‚Äôt talk about other toys, not who is left holding the bag on this or that beenie baby. Totally different phenomenon.
No way, I got a job with no college degree in 1973 and I'm totally fine, everyone else who is struggling is just lazy!
True that
How is survivorship bias a thing with dogecoin?

A kid who returned X% of dollars would have the same experience as anyone else investing at the same time. There would be no survivorship bias in this case because everyone is attached to the same crypto's ups and downs. The only externalities would be people who just bought when it was at like it's ATH which would be yesterday. But buying at a higher point then something falling is something that's basically ubiquitous with any investment. So nothing to do in particular with it being a ""memecoin"" or making it behave like one would.

The overall growth of Dogecoin is up. So unless they sold, there would be no survivorship bias.
LinkedIn is the worse for that.
Yup, and it makes loads of people make the wrong decisions in life for many things.
Famous actors always tell you to ""follow your dreams"".
Yup, especially in the self-help or self-improvement world.
There's an amazing story about WWII (I think). 

There were planes flying back with damage on their wings/back and planes that wouldn't make it back at all cause they went down.

In an attempt to improve their planes chance of survival, the military people added armor to wherever they saw bullet holes. Planes went out, about the same percentage got destroyed, the ones who came back had **even more** bullet holes, so the military beefed up the armor where they saw their planes were getting shot again. Rinse and repeat this a fed times.

Eventually the military gets annoyed and calls in a brilliant mathematician to asses the situation. The person says ""put a lot of armor where you see no bullet holes.""

This made no sense to anyone but they did it and, lo and behold, way more planes survived their fights.

The mathematician explained that, due to survivorship bias, people only saw the damage on the planes that survived. This meant that A) the places they saw bullet holes were where a plane could be shot and still function and B) anywhere there were no bullet holes meant if a plane got shot there it would go down, so no one could ever see a plane that was shot there.
It's true I survived I was there
Yepp, ain't nobody gonna learn about that species that climate changed themselves into extinction for made up monopoly money.
What is survivorship bias
What's the story. I'm interested
[deleted]
Same. Then I eventually broke even so I got my ""playing money"" back out of it and bought GameStop at $300, lal.

I also sold the 12,000 doge I mined myself in 2 weeks. For $200. Then when it took off again I told my friends it might be smart to sell theirs too. It was at 0.03.

So now I'm just keeping my mouth shut and buy a little bit of BTC every month, and that's it.
back in late 2017, i was a CFO in a construction company. 

while in a meating with a supplier and our CEO, he bragged how he've just managed to make his bank to transfer 2 mil$ off shore to buy bitcoin (in israel such transfers are handled with suspition due to bank regulation). 

the date was **december 17, 2017** (i remember the date because the same day i signed my first financial report to the public). 

&#x200B;

no need to say what happend few days later.
Cashing out coins to fiat is the hard part
Sounds like a you problem. I fomo'd in 2017, not once did that happen to me. And nobody I know.
I put like $200 in random coins none made me any money but doge
Excellent point! I started reminding myself of that too .. and if I sold something after a spike and then it went higher.. I remind myself that after I sold I used the money to invest in something else. 
At the end of the day.. did you make a profit? Good. The fact that is could have been more if you had a crystal ball or time machine.. is not relevant. Up is up!
Also when Amazon stock crashed in '99 it took 9 years for it to go back up to '99 prices.
Still hurts. like the other day I placed order for ETC at $56 out of nowhere but then said nah and cancelled. immediately launched.
I've made over $1000 since january with 2 trades in blockbuster stock. $bliaq
It's hard to do but you can still buy shares of blockbuster I believe
Yes! I make a point to say to myself ""It's a good thing I didn't buy X"" any time I think ""Damn, I considered buying Y and should have."" One very short term example: I considered buying Cartesi when it got listed on Coinbase a couple days ago. Could have doubled my money quickly. I also considered jumping into Dogecoin at 70 cents, and would be freaking out right now if I had. I ended up deciding both were too risky, so whatever. Investments you don't make are probably a wash.
I still think blockbuster could have been saved if their parent company didn't fuck them over. A RC type of activist could have helped it pivot into a blockchain Netflix
Oh no, I just bought blockbuster
I would however buy a share of the last blockbuster in bend, just because I really admire the owner for working so hard to keep it going.
if I raised some decent money on crypto, I would definitely not talk about it with anyone. For personal safety
Or because they cashed out before bitcoin changed their lives. It's easy to see the uptrend of bitcoin in the long term , it's harder to see when you are a year into the bear market being -80% down.
It‚Äôs easy to make ¬£1m if you start with 100k

Easier if you start with 500k
Most of the bitcoin og's cashed out way before 60k.
I have a theory this is also the reason why Dogecoin OGs don't post on this sub anymore.
Also if I made millions on bitcoin I wouldn't go around talking about it because I'd have to reveal my real identity just for anyone to believe me, which would then open me up to every toxic loser and scammer in the crypto-sphere.
I'll eventually use my crypto gains to wrassle and hustle my way into boiled denims and crow eggs.  

In all seriousness, I think the best portfolio right now is one made up of cannabis, psychedelic pharma, green energy, and crypto.  Young people should focus on increasing their ability to invest in these growth industries by first investing in themselves (i.e. by acquiring skills and credentials that enable them to secure gainful employment.)
This is true. I hardly post now that I made my millions. I used to post so much because I had a dream, and now that dream is here.
If i made millions i wouldn't even be here. Probably in my personal paradise with 10 naked women.
Idk I‚Äôll still be moon farming once I reach my goals.
I'd like to think I would still shitpost if I made life changing millions.

how do you know i‚Äôm not one of those early investors
But you always get new goals. Think of the person who could have x10 his 100$ million if he went all-in on a hunch he had. He who be like ""if only I went for it"". I'm sure this sort of events happen in life much. You can always change your life that's what I'm saying.

Also, it quite likely that there are a fine amount millionaires in this sub. Considering the size... There should be tons of millionaires+ around here.

People have no reason to show off and many reasons to not.
Exactly, like who has to gain by posting these winning stories? Pumpers
I can't hear you over the sound of my jetski engine.
(I wish this was true)
I lost 21 Bitcoins in 2012, but around 2017 I started creating real value to the system rather then just hodl or trading and I hope to end the year with 100 000 CAD on my bank account and 100 000 CAD worth of crypto. 

I think this is a realistic goal. I am looking forward to paying my taxes  next year in april.  The higher the  better. Then my next target is 400 000 CAD in the next 2 years, and then I am going to buy the house I am currently renting in.

I told myself 5 to 7 years and I will own this house without a morgage. 

And I am way ahead of the target  right now.
I'm also starting to wonder if those ""successful investors turned advice givers"" were fakes.
I usually ask myself once I reach that point and sell my stack if I will be able to completely disconnect from crypto or I will eternally calculate how much Woud I had and feel miserable for selling
me someone who bought 2 bitcoin in 2017 on coinbase but have absolutely 0 history of a wallet or a key or whatever it was back then. so i have a lot of money floating into the universe i will never see lol. 

can see my history on coinbase sending it to my wallet. no idea what wallet i used or where it was. i save everything and i screen shot everything. its so depressing üòÇüò≠
Like getting investigated by the irs XD

Not to shit post, but that's a thing in the news this week. Do your taxes properly Americans!
This is such a good point.  Rich people have better things to do than argue on the internets.  Of course there are exceptions, but generally speaking.
So they don‚Äôt have to moon farm...
I lost 4 or so coins and didn't sweat it because BTC was only around 50 bucks at the time. Now, though...I still don't sweat it because there is nothing I can do to get them back. Lol
The truth is, most people that bought at 0.01$ sold at 0.1$, people that bought at 0.1$ sold at 1$, people that bought at 1$ sold at 10$, etc...
Ya, I know a couple guys from college who have never said anything about it directly, but they were already pumping BTC in 2012/2013. Now one of them is a serial entrepreneur who travels all of the world, and the other also travels the word and is a professional slackliner. They are certainly not hanging out of crypto subs in their spare time.
My manager is friends w the guy who bought the pizza with Bitcoin 

Manager talks about wishing he‚Äôs listened to that guy about Bitcoin back in the day
Making millions results in you having more time to shitpost on reddit.
I have a theory that (in the UK at least) there's a decent number of people who made a few million from something or other and are content to live off the interest.
Not take over the world.
Not run a company.
Just exist. And so you never hear about them.
...yet.

Most people never hit that kind of milestone.
Yea, thats why you have to look at some ‚Äúcrypto experts‚Äù with a grain of salt





If they were so smart and ahead of the game why are they telling you about this exciting new coin they found.






If i made millions off of a coin id fuck off to Japan, to never be heard of from again
90% of sub 1k btc investors were drug dealing and buying illegal shit. I remember every highschooler back in 2014 trading btc around on coinbase and SR1/2. 

Never ment one person online with proof of ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù at that stage for btc. Just randos making claims with no proof.
I always wonder what happened to the winners (those who did get rich and/or met their moon goals)? Like do you stop trying to earn free crypto? Do you stop participating in this group? Did you get a new identity that came with a 'too cool for school' attitude?
My group of friend just made a good amount off of ETC this last week. None of them use Reddit, and none of them share their success stories. Stealth Wealth is real, and should be utilized
You also don't hear about the early Bitcoin investors who are looking through junkyards or their hard drive, because even with a job in the technology sector they couldn't just you know make backups or a cold wallet.
Also many got ripped off w/ mt gox
I mean I put 20 bucks into doge and turned it into 500. I fully expected to never see the 20 bucks again, and still don't. But fact is if I wanted it, there's 500 for the taking right now.
You also don't hear about the countless who lost their bitcoin or got scammed into poverty before crypto reddit was a thing
I mined 24 btc for shits and giggles back when btc was worthless.

Cashed out at $15k during the initial spike. Could be a millionaire now off of letting my computer mine overnight occasionally, but I got a house, and debt free out of it cashing out when I did. Worked out well for me.
Bruh, early Bitcoin investors used all of their crypto to buy weed.
They just move over to r/fire and r/fatfire
Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt talk to you people anymore if I was a crypto millionaire
I just want 5 million dollars for creating nothing, is that so unreasonable?
Fuck yeah!
The ones who forgot their wallets and stumbled upon them when cleaning out their hardware closet. This was a common story back in 2013-2015. Some people bought hundreds of coin when Bitcoin was trading at less than 2 dollars. They forgot about it until they saw their old harddrives and the price of BTC.
[deleted]
Oh yes, those drugs traffickers and pedos now enjoying the good life
Can confirm. Buddy of mine made serious bitcoin moolah and we never heard from him again lol
A friend of mine made millions buying btc. He doesn't talk about it in the sense that he doesn't tell people how he got his money. Instead he acts like he's some kind of moneywizard entrepreneur and it's fucking obnoxious.
25% gains are pretty badass

what is your exit strategy? that is my biggest concern. i dont know when to sell, how much to sell.... and what to di with money i get from sale...

its impossible to make this decision because ppl say doge will reach 1$, eth 10k, bitcoin 100k....... if i double my money then i will sell half of my stuff and keep euros on accounts so that i can buy some dips here and there but my goal is to ""play with house money"" and start staking. atm i cant stake cuz most of my portfolio is on coinbase and staking is not available yet
Did you buy $100 more in crypto?
That's about where I'm also at, I'm happy with my current gains and excited for the positions I'm holding long-term.
This is me. I put 600 into GME and walked away with 1200. Put 50 into Doge now at 100. I'm pretty ok with everything so far but this shit is heart attack inducing I can't imagine completely YOLO'ing everything.
probably because you hang out in a sub that craps on the winners
Invested 330 between doge, ada and atom in February and March, also mining ether since February, now I'm sitting on $1200 but I don't know when to cash out
That‚Äôs me lol
I started last week with ‚Ç¨900 and now have ‚Ç¨1070.
lol, that's me, put $400 in in 2017, now have $500
I bought $100 worth of bitcoin a few weeks ago, it went up to $140, crashed to $60, soared to $220 then crashed to $160 again when Elon publicly ridiculed it... I can't be bothered selling yet.
You should have seen this place 3-2 years ago. Dread and desperation all around
Nah, it's a reddit post. A moon farming one
r/lifeprotips
Hijacking this comment to say that memecoin doesn't arbitrarily create and erase wealth - the value fluctuates based on supply and demand. The dude that made millions on memecoin collected millions of everyone else's money, that put money in when he cashed out. He bought coins from someone selling those coins at a low price, and then sold them to someone (s) buying at a high price, at significantly different times.

There is no free money in crypto - you're just taking someone else's money, that they gave you, or you're giving someone else your money, for memecoin.
Be me. First time ever in crypto. Invested in ltc and doge around a month ago.  Made 70 on ltc, withdrew everything and put it into doge at 27 cents. Doge went up to 42, i sold and immediately bought back in like a dummy thinking 420 would moon doge. Doge dropped to 20 cents. I was sad but still held. Now doge is at around .70 and ive more than doubled my money. My point is 42 cents was the ceiling. Now 70 is but for how long.
Imagine being the one buying BTC at the top in 2013
 Last time I got too scared and pulled out when it dropped from .08 down to .05.  Don't want to miss out again, but not willing to push my luck because of the odds of it going down right after I buy again lol.
I bought doge at the top because of SNL ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
That's a great way of looking at it. I put in $400 at .52 for fun. Already have been happy with the money I made, but am definitely staying in for a while to see what happens. Of course I would never do this with money I really needed right then.
Honestly, I made like a 30% profit on a shitcoin and instead of hoping that it would go higher, I just sold. I think the HODL nonsense on this sub is ridiculous. There is nothing wrong with taking a profit. What's the point of money if you're never going to touch it?
[deleted]
That was me with my gme.  Bought in at 75.  Could have sold at 400 and then it craters back to 40.  When it hit 180 I said fuck it and sold.  No matter what happens with gme I'll have almost 3x my investment in the span of 2 months.  That money paid for a brand new fence around my house so my dogs could run around outside for the first time in their lives at my place.

Totally worth it
You did good. Don‚Äôt ever try and predict the bottom or the top. That‚Äôs one of the tricks to getting out in time.

It‚Äôs almost the classic double or nothing syndrome. You keep doubling up and winning and don‚Äôt know when to stop and keep going on until you lose it all
I x16 my Money with the part I sold already. So even if all I have in goes down to nothing I did not really loose anything.

But if I sell now, and could have made another x4 of what it's worth now.. I KNOW that I'd be pissed forever lol
Ambition isn't a weird quirk. It's literally at the heart of human civilization. The modern world doesn't exist without it.
Yup, thank you for this, I only started with a small amount but it's already at 180% of my original investment, cashing a little out and leaving some in as I'm not bothered if it crashes now
I‚Äôve just started this week and I‚Äôve already covered all my fees and am into profit. Not a huge amount but on a 5-10 year plan that‚Äôs a great start compared to standard interest.
This is a great point, it's also important to remember that we kind predict the future. Some people get lucky and make good investments, but if you miss out, you shouldn't blame yourself. It goes for all coins, like those who bought into Dogecoin and have already made great profit, that was a good decision, even if it's a meme coin, real money is in it.

We should respect each others investment decisions, even if we don't agree, we're all going for the same thing, and any profit is a win, even if you believe you could have made more.
I cashed out my Doge investment earlier today after it doubled. Riding the rest so I can cash out after Elon does his talk.

Thank you for your story, it makes the thought of *what might be lost* less painful to bear.
You‚Äôve hit the nail on the head. Crypto is full of greedy investors that expect 5/10/100x on their investments over a few weeks. Patience is a virtue.
I had a few BTC around 10 years ago and ended up buying some DMT with it. Thanks Joe Rogan...
Who would have guessed that BTC would get that big.
People need to stop citing the irrelevant 'x percent' return. 1 percent of 1 trillion is significantly different than 1 percent of 10. Now I can play a game with someone just to mess with their 'successful investor' title: They give me one dollar once; after one year I give them 100 dollar back. And that's it. So 100-fold return. Wow. Are they one of the most successful investors of all time? No. The magnitude of investment and profit matter too.

If I had a trillion of trillion of trillion of dollar out of no where and could invest them with return low as 0.000000000000001%, I'd still get back more than any of us could ever dream.
20% is great, but like.. you can go to a roulette table and you'll make 100% all the time. that is probably a more apt comparison to some of these crypto investments
I remember those 4chan threads and how much spamming they were doing. A lot of tards at the time didn't invest because it was just a bunch of degenerates buying into what looked like a pyramid scheme. Doge and other shitcoins eventually sprang up and killed the momentum for a lot of people.
That's some nice gains!
I turned $10k into $30k in a span of two weeks.

While it's a gamble, it's was fairly obvious that it was going to value like hell in short-term.

Most people butthurt about it aren't due to the fact that it's never going to reach $10, they're butthurt about the fact that had they paid more attention, they could have tripled or quadrupled their investment in just a couple weeks or even days.

Just like you shouldn't take the ""$100 to the moon"" BS like truth, you shouldn't treat it like it's a scam/money pit either.

Smart people make money by being smart at the right times, and that's true for any investment that ever existed.
Check your DM‚Äôs
NARRATOR: It was funny because ... he didn't look *newish.*
I bought Doge at $0.006 and only put down a dollar, so 143 shares. I have made 90 dollars right now. Only if I put down more then
How do I start? Ive been wanting to but I have no idea how to get involved. Im poor so Ill only put 20 dollars in then hold for ten years lol
Laughs in taxes
hey I‚Äôm trying to get into investing in crypto, can I pm you to ask you how ya do it ?
Look at Mr. Money over here
You joke. But some of these people putting 30 bucks in can‚Äôt really afford to come out with less than that 30 bucks
But if you didn‚Äôt leave...
You left with $15 because you sold.
I put 30 bucks in and came out with 720 üò≥
So you panic sold?
I put $1000 into DOGE at around $0.019...a day or two later it hit like .07 or something. I didn't sell and then it plummeted back down to where I purchased it at. Fear of it going lower made me sell and break even. A week or two later is when it started the thunderous rise it's on now. Oops.

My brother would have made around 200k at this point if he didn't sell at the same time as me. Eh...you live and you learn I suppose.

Now I just mine crypto and I'm averaging $20-25/day.
I bought $50 worth in an attempt to crash it but all I've done is turn a hefty profit. Pisses me off, I want my other coins to go up, not tucking doge.
CDC just promoted (tweeted about) a new meme coin on their exchange called $SHIB... might be worth looking into... if you‚Äôre into gambling small $ for millions of coins

Edit: Looks like another dumb money hype coin with dumber money returns lol
Now this kind of joke gets less funny with every zero added to it, doesn't it pal
Not with 30 buch, but definitelly be careful about what you invest in
Instructions unclear. Invested my last 60 bucks in Cumrocket.
Instructions unclear. Invested my last 60 bucks in Cumrocket.
Super early on when doge spiked at 7 cents, I put $100 in, then it immediately dropped back down to 3 cents,  and I lost $11 when I sold it at 5 cents lol so I feel you. Been too scared ever since to retry doge
Only a true financial genius could lose money on a coin that's gained 24,440% in the last year, 1,020% in the last month
Just let it be, it‚Äôs not a get rich quick scheme it‚Äôs crypto it takes time
Damn you must be rich. That‚Äôs a lot of FU money
At least you lowered your tax liability by $15.
I put $5 in doge coin, like 5 or 6 years ago.
Right there with you my friend. Bought at .73 ‚òπÔ∏è
$30 can feed my whole family for 3 months
>No one talks about their failures

I encourage you to visit r/WSB for some loss porn then.

^(/s)
Survivor bias also leads to sunk cost fallacy.
Haha, my biggest failure was refusing to sell TRX at ATH in the last run. Between my initial $1,500 buy in and nonstop day trading I had All-In‚Äôd my TRX stack to a valuation of ~$670k when it peaked... I kept riding the hopium at the way back down to the bottom. I learned my lesson, diversified, picked some winners and losers in the bear market and have gotten back up to a couple hundred k, mostly just through patience and üíé üôåüèª at this point.

Biggest advice I can give is the market will never repeat exactly and as we can see right now, fundamentals mean nothing. Take your profits, play on house money, pay your taxes and NEVER EVER leverage yourself on hopium.
Brings to mind Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy's.  He got his GED later in life because he didn't want people looking him to for being successful without a high school diploma.  He knew he was the rare exception.
You saying that one in a million chances don't repeat nine times out of ten?
People talk about selling at the all time high like there isn't someone on the other side of that transaction. Like the money just comes from nowhere.
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs very few people in the world who put in $1000 and lost everything down to a penny.
could be millions
Dozens*

There are dozens of us
You‚Äôve nearly made 100% of ur money back. That‚Äôs pretty damn good returns mate well done. I‚Äôm similar, put 450 in and now it‚Äôs worth around 690.
$300 ETC into $750 in a few days. Cashed out cus im poor. Thank jeebs i did cus its been getting milked hard.
[removed]
I did pretty much the same and now the 500 are on bitcoin and all the benefit are still on dogecoin so when it will go i'll still have bitcoin.
How ? with doge?
Do that a few more times and you're talking life changing moolah. Exponential growth, cuz.

Seriously tho. If you can double your money over and over, that gets somewhere very, very quickly.
Is there even such a thing as a safe investment?
Did you recover?
The real test is the selling part in my opinion.

You could be up 100x, but as long as you don't sell it's still unrealized gains. Many young investors are probably up a ton at the moment, but if the market suddenly takes a nosedive, those gains could quickly dissapear.

And for the people thinking a stop-loss will prevent this, you could be in for a surprise.
1000% in 24 hours lol. Sold half at that point. These altcoins are ridiculous.
Honestly, for crypto, gambling on tons of small cap coins with some meme/whatever other appeal is a viable strat.

Only need 1 out of every 50 or so to somewhat catch on to end up making a big profit.

The tech aspect of coins is overvalued in a market where 99% of 'investors' barely understand what it all means.
[deleted]
Another meme coin? What ya referring to?
Yup we did
I have my shiba on Hotbit from a month ago, but Hotbit is down and I can‚Äôt sell during the hype. This is such a feelsbadman
Well some of us holding Shiba tokens got in at a low entry point before the market picked it up. I bought at 0.00000227 before I multiplied by 7-8X times that It is today. And we are not selling until a few years down the line.
And 10% Payout fee lol. And then you also have to pay taxes on it.
Ngl I am jealous that their are 8 year old kids out their who put their birthday money in a meme coin and are now richer than me
Or rather, you only hear about a gamblers winnings.
[removed]
You also dont hear about people who actually like the way cryptocurrency could revolutionize monetary markets and pave the way for a more equitable and fair economy. It is just 100% hype at the moment and most people have no Idea what is actually possible.
[removed]
It‚Äôs me: invested $100 and return of $1700 so far
I invested $1100 about 2 or 3 years ago in ethereum.

I raked in my $11k about 2 months ago.

So I'm sad a bit bc it'd be 30K now... But it's real cash now so whatever
Telcoin - has good utility and is up ungodly amounts since last year.
If I day trade I would have to pay taxes.. no thanks lol

&#x200B;

I'm from Germany and if you hold for 1 year+ and sell you don't have to pay taxes on that for some reason.
Love Ada. Bullish and hope it doesn‚Äôt disappoint
Doge is definitely going to collapse all the way back down.  I don't want to be near it once it does.
You could have also just gone to a roulette table and bet on black. All investment is gambling to an extent but day trading and meme coins are essentially chance at this point.
Uhhh yeah be careful huge taxes in US for day trading crypto look into it. My friend made 100k day trading coins but ended up paying so much in tax.
Not back to .00004 or whatever it was? Any reason for that level of support?
Back to ¬ß0.3? lol no. No one would expect Doge goes further than ¬ß0.10. Invest now before it gets to the moon. The moon I'm talking about here is hundred to thousand.
I ofteb trade futures and buy dips using leverage. Turned $1 into $2000 until I lost most of it doing dumb shit. Back in at $1 and up to $5.90, but my main buy eth just skyrocketed so I'm just sitting and waiting.
I got lucky and quadrupled my portfolio with doge.
[deleted]
Why would you?
Yea I was thinking there must be a bunch of other meme coins I don't know about for this post to be true.
Feels like another fake post to scare people away from doge

They‚Äôre worried and it gives me more motivation to buy in even harder
[deleted]
This is what I did!
My Doge strategy was to take all gains each month 50/50 btc and eth. I would have 10x if I stayed in but instead 3x but could sleep at night knowing I wasn‚Äôt going to get recked by Elon
i have mediocre pc (2080ti) would it be advisable to use it for mining or will it destroy/wear it down
And if you can now pay off your mortgage from DOGE gains, more power to you
Exactly when the governments of the world are printing money at rates never seen before larger crypto coins are as stable as bonds, but grow wayyyy better.
Did something similar, went in about a month ago, but still haven't cashed out but will probably do so soon
I'll be honest. Doge is my entry, and I got in late. Any kind of money made from it is a win. Anything I make from it will likely goto something else.
That's exactly my case! I got in at the end of January when Doge was 2 cents, got obsessed with crypto, decided to dip my finger in many pies, and now own a total of 13 tokens :p More than half of my investment is tied up in 4 tokens, though, the others are just there in small amounts in case they spike (as Doge did). I don't have much to invest, but I've nearly quadrupled my portfolio worth in the space of just over 3 months. I'm really happy with how things have gone so far, and once I cash out Doge (I have a sell limit for 95 cents), I'll have covered my full initial investment, and everything left will be profit :)
That‚Äôs how I found out about crypto. I watch stocks M-F and crypto S-Sun. I am an addict.
Where can I go to research more about mining on a home rig?
Hundreds of projects did not survive last bear market. Some 2020 top 20s didn't do so hot.
Yesterday, while walking, i heard two youngsters (they were around 15-16 yo) talking about Doge. When i heard Doge my brain said ""wuuut"" (we never escape crypto), so i picked a few words up : one of them had put money into Doge and was advis... sorry, was saying to his friend he earned a lot, and that he sho... could do the same because it's not too late. 100‚Ç¨ is nothing when you can make 1000. 

I was like, mmh... yeah, ok. Not sure he added ""but idk though"" at some point, i should have spied on them, at least for science.
How do you differentiate a good project from a bad when the vast majority are promises of future services? LTO is one of a handful of projects actually doing things that impact anything outside the cryptosphere, and its flown straight under the radar outside of reddit to the point I wonder if I'll even break even on my investment come another bull market, should a bear market see a 90% drop.
> sold at the wrong time

They didn't ""sell at the wrong time"", they ""sold at a time that seemed sensible to them but turned out to be unlucky"". That's not *wrong* from their at-the-time perspective. They didn't make *bad* decisions, they made *unlucky* decisions. The difference between these two positions is crucial here, because you shouldn't try and assign blame to people for bad luck - and *you're* trying to assign blame to them.

> or picked the wrong projects

As above but even moreso. There is *no* objective reliable method for telling the ""bad"" projects from the ""good"" until it's too late.
[deleted]
All in in Quant for the third year, made most of my gains exactly during the bear market
Yes, you only lose money if you sell
People who play the lottery would be millionaires too if only they picked the right numbers.
Needed to hear this on my PLTR big position at 28.58, thanks :)
HODL is proven to be the best strategy so far
>The majority of people lost their money because they sold at the wrong time

The point is that there always has to be these people for the big winners to exist. Crypto is mostly speculation, there is no underlying value like stocks where you own a bit of a company and you make the capital gains from it doing well.
Rt. If you just held BTC at this point regardless of any time in history that you could have purchased you would be straight
Can confirm. Though even the bad projects I have(dbc) have not lost me any money because of dca. People get rekt because they have weak hands or put in too much money to hodl through a 3 year bear market.
Don't you realize that there cannot be winners without losers? Every win is taken from some dumber person, who thinks they'll be able to scam someone else for more. 

The losers in this game don't know they've lost yet, but they're definitely out there. It's how pyramid schemes work.
Meme talk is the same as baby talk
If you don't sell, you don't lose !
Is NANO the wrong project? Seems like a solid coin, but it's easily my biggest loser since 2018 (hodling for 3 years).
Yeah, my 4k was up to 14k in 2017 and down to 1.5k all through 2018. I'm up to 25k and have taken profits.

If you only put in money to gamble with then no reason to sell on a loss if you believe in crypto as a whole.
Doge is a shitcoin and it's rocketing. In hindsight it looks obvious which projects were wrong but it's absolutely impossible to know in advance.
I‚Äôm finally in the black on LTC bought in Dec 2017!
Don't forget the exchanges that went under (remember [MtGox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox)?), the ones that got hacked, [or the fools who put off setting up a wallet and their mining pool shuts down and their untransfered mined dogecoins go poof](https://no.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/3lfmik/dogehashfastercom_what_happened/).
I‚Äôve held 7000 dogecoin since early 2020. It‚Äôs been good to me.
It's not too late to invest in it. So much salty tears over nothing
To get around that feeling, just realize that you were lucky enough to be apart of it at all. You also did everything right, investing only what you could afford to lose. I could have had $1,000,000 if I invested X amount, but In reality I never would have invested that, so its not worth feeling bad. I made 200x off a small investment and that's still amazing on its own.
[deleted]
Honestly, I'm still ""bagholding"" GME because I genuinely believe the stock will moon. The hedge funders are still trying to suppress it and the manipulation is obvious if you just look at the chart. Interesting how the stock surges, reaches $180 and then immediately goes down (at least 5 times in a row for this past month). Yeah, totally natural market movement... The price also dips 10-15% when you can see there is basically no volume.
Can't wait to hear from all the people who invested their life savings into DOGE expecting to make life changing amounts of money. Lol most people who invested within the last few days in preparation for musk's SNL are going to walk away with either 10% gains or 100% losses depending on when they sell.
Good thing we don't depend on sole shitcoin..

Got 8k of those and counting
Shitposters ain't much of readers themselves
You also could have lost your investment. Anything can happen really.
I bet you also forgot about all the other stocks or coins you read about and considered investing in. The only reason GME and DOGE are remembered is because they did well. I bet there was a stock or shitcoin that you heard about that could have easily gone from 1k to .01.

We only remember the investments that do well. I thought I found a hidden gem once with a stock. I only invested $25 and it‚Äôs now worth $2.03. Most people can‚Äôt time the market and a lot of this is gambling.
For anyone who doesn‚Äôt know the rules: 

#1 Never Invest more than you can lose 
#2 DCA
#3 HODL

Edit: I don‚Äôt know why this is so big.
Without using emotion, using your brain only: pick a multiple to have as your goal.

For example, let's say you put in $100 and pick a multiple goal of 5x. That means if you see yourself hit $500, that's when it's time to sell. Don't get greedy. Stick to what you told yourself you'd do.

A 5x multiple is **very** respectable. Yes you've seen examples of something going 10,000x. But that's not you.

One last note:

Let's say you put in $100 and then made gains. Whether it ends up being worth $300 or $1000 or any number: when you've hit that amount of profit, withdraw 2x your original investment, and turn it back into fiat.

For example:

You put in $100. Its value goes up to $300. You withdraw $200, and turn it back into cash. Now you've doubled your investment, *and* you still have $100 invested. On the investment side of things, you're only back to where you started (which is a great place to be). I then like to look at that investment as ""free money"".
sell when you're comfortable with what you made. Don't listen to anyone telling you to ""hold the line"" its BS.
You will never go broke taking a profit.
So just used his stimulus money. Good for him
Lollll
So just used his stimulus money. Good man lol
There is a lot of memeing with Doge, but it's just indicative of the large and casual community. For a currency, I think it's a good thing in the long term to have a large community.
At what point did you decide to make the transition?
so...why haven't you reinvested in doge? popularity is one of the most important parts of crypto...
[deleted]
so also hundreds
It's 'should have', never 'should of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
That logic scares me crypto, stock or otherwise. You lay it out there you might lost it and I need to understand that from the get go
This is my mindset. Mainly because I don‚Äôt know hardly anything about crypto. I could afford to spend $150 on doge when it was at .011 and the minute that money left my bank account I wrote it off as gone. Monopoly money, to be used for learning about cryptocurrency. If I depended on that $150 to eat or pay bills, there‚Äôs no way I would have spent it.
Isnt it now at an ath?
Amen!
I can spot people who aren‚Äôt vested real quick.
This bull run was all about major community coins, and they can't handle that they didn't catch that trend
Yes.
Exactly right.

I always wonder how many actually sold at all and made those gains actual made money. 

""I'm rich, it's gone x1000!!!!""

""Oh, I'm poor again, I didn't sell and it's bombed.""
[deleted]
> too early

The state ""too early"" only exists in hindsight. Nobody knew they were selling ""too early"" at the time at which they sold. You cannot blame people for bad luck.
I can see selling a memecoin at a loss when it only pumps if Elon tweets about it to try to make more money in other coins.  If you sold DOGE ""early"" and put that in BNB, which has pretty much been a sure thing since it overtook the ETH blockchain in daily transactions, then you more than made all that back.  Congrats to everyone who bought DOGE during the height first pump and held it this whole time, but those people were taking a much bigger gamble in doing that.
That's not the definition of ""losing money.""
Or sold too late.
Most people have the attention span of a goldfish. They wanna lambo next week.
Most of the psa post are garbage.

You havent missed out on nothing. There are more coins gaining traction every year. People look at doge and say damn I missed out... you have so many that yielded the same gains in the last year or two. A simple 2k investment would have you happy rn. I have had xmr since 120 and every month it gives me 100 bucks. I hold 8 coins that's 800 bucks a month. People just dont know how to watch over their money.  üòÇ
So you consider Bitcoin a ""memecoin""?
nothing wrong with the post. you‚Äôre getting upvotes by morons. and you sound stupid
You may have a bad time when Bitcoin Cash replaces Bitcoin
Same I'm at 13k from a 1k investment
Great! You got lucky, you didn't make a good ""investment.""
hope you took at least some profits already
I haven't sold yet, but yeah, massive gains if you invested in 2014
Unfortunately I think you‚Äôre right.  

A lot of people are going to get burned.  This goes for people that are holding other cryptos too but doge is going to be a bloodbath.  

That being said, I think they might actually get it to a dollar+ before that happens.
I was just at the gym and a bunch of 18 year old kids were talking about doge. I think that‚Äôs a sign.

A couple of days I heard another older guy talking about how he‚Äôs making $10k a week with some investment and really shouldn‚Äôt have to work... idk he was referring to, but I think a lot of people are in for a world of hurt.
[deleted]
I have a few mantras for investing. One is I will never chase a stock. I have been burned on some meme stocks after they had a run up.
But then they get to LARP as the OGs in 2025!
Welcome to the jungle ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥
Exactly, there is value behind the right community. Same as how famous brands are made. Supreme is valuable because of the community
Wisest post itt
>and spreading them on every coin 

Might be actually the worst 'advice' I've seen in here, and I can assure you - I've seen things.

Overdiversification in every second shitcoin out there is going to drain your limited capital in no time, while the opportunity costs of the decent projects you haven't been able to research (because you were busy gambling on shitcoins) will be massive. That's where the real long-term gains lie
Im hodling as hard as i can!

![gif](giphy|d0DdMCREQChi3jGymW)
This is what actually needed to be said.
If you want to be sure long term, invest in top coins such as BTC or ETH and others close to the top
Yeah, people talk about how pumped crypto is, but crypto MCAP is tiny, only 2.4 T.

The stock market is 50T.

Also crypto is constantly being worked on and improved, there's definitely a lot to achieve.

And that is looking at crypto as pure vehicle for speculation(which it mostly is), but if crypto can actually get more utility as real currency, there's even more room for capital growth.

I'm personally dropping $50 in an odd mid-level market cap($500m) cryptos with cheap transaction costs, as i believe those have a future actually being used as currency.
That gif is golden lol
A gazillion 95 internet startups aren‚Äôt around any longer. A gazillion car companies around at the start of the car era aren‚Äôt around any longer. Just because an industry/tech is world changing, doesn‚Äôt mean your investment in it will pay.
This is the way.
I remember the Gandalf tune from that one DS streamer with this exact same gif
Did you really compare the crptyo bubble to the .com bubble and then unironically tell people to hodl?
At least if ur going for memes hold the right one
Wow this is terrible advice.

Nothing is guaranteed, buddy.
Rubbish. 95% of them will crash and burn. Dyor, invest in the worthwhile ones, and your odds change from 95% fail to maybe 50% fail. More money in fewer, but sounder, investments gives you a far better chance of a good return. But it's still a gamble. Only bet what you can afford to lose.
Here‚Äôs an angle you may not have considered: those meme coins bring new people into crypto. I have people around me talking about doge now who don‚Äôt know anything about crypto. Some are going to say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a sign of a bubble‚Äù but I think it‚Äôs actually the thin wedge of mass crypto adoption across the planet
At some point everyone is gonna want their money back. And most people use a third party, they don‚Äôt have whatever wallet supports doge. So I feel like it‚Äôs gonna be a weird ride moving forward. Like even if Doge ends up getting dev support again and places start accepting it, I would bet like 90% of people fall into the third party investment group which means they all will have to sell and buy again. I wonder how that will work / effect the price

Im not in and it‚Äôs way too late now. If that shit goes to the moon then so be it.
Jealousy likely the main culprit, people are having a tough time coping that their long term investments are getting outshined by a memecoin.
[removed]
I've been wondering this as well. Subbed to a bunch of crypto subs hoping to get some posts in my feed about new smart contract projects or cool uses for these crypto, but it's mostly WSB type posts
Same here . For dogelon . lol. Man, it hurts. But I can‚Äôt blame on anyone else. It‚Äôs my FOMO and my greed. I‚Äôve learned my lessons. I will be a better investor next time.
üòÖ
Oof
$3940.74 give or take $6...
It‚Äôs never too late! It just cost more to get in it now.
I felt this.
I bought $25 of Dogecoin in 2014 and I'm waiting for it to reach $1.00. I will make over $50,000 off a $25 investment.
You think the meme coin hype is over? I feel like we have 1 or 2 more coins in this bill run to make money
Yep. This is far more likely to happen to all the SuriusCoins thatn the 1 memcoin that can't go above 1$. I get the warning but it sounds bitter from missing out. bad math & false stories.
When you want to sell, there has to be a pool of buyers, or you can't. If everyone is selling, no buyers. In a small market, much greater chance of that situation occurring.
This is true for any market, not specifically crypto.
can someone mention 1 story of the hundreds where people lost $1000 down to 1cent on the 1 memecoin that cant go over 1$?
But if you pull out that doesn‚Äôt maximize your gainz! /s but also I can‚Äôt pull out of anything. Heh
Yeah and end up with 75% less.. *safescam* cough üò∑
Totally correct. Has worked out for a lot of people to go against good advice due to the tech bull market (to generalize about the primary population receiving RSUs). But that's life, you can make good decisions and get punished.
Crypto **currency** is not a stock or a company you invest in, it is supposed to be a currency or a store of value, some people simply don¬¥t like the fiat money system
You mean you didn‚Äôt invest in a crypto that dropped from $1000 to $.10? Shit me either because that never happened lol
Can I interest you in Dutch Tulip Bulbs?
Damn dude, that's rough. Hindsight is 20/20 though man. Nobody saw this coming.
You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about....
Agreed. It doesn't matter if it should be shit, just the hype can easily see this hitting 3 or 4 dollars a coin by mid summer. And if a thousand dollars lost is life changing money, you shouldn't be investing in anything then a high yield cd or the such.
They just made it up. It‚Äôs not real

The doge project is dead. There‚Äôs no core team and the volunteers have barely touched the code in months and for anyone say they have just take a look at the commits on GitHub. 

Unless someone takes charge of the project it‚Äôs going to sink sooner than you think. The coin dropped about 33% since Elon called it a hustle and he was about the main reason why it soared so dramatically.
Which one rugged you?
I have to disagree with ya. Or rather would like to improve on your advice. Treat ""Memecoins"" like the caaino. 

There are plenty of cryptos that have a specific goal, (Algorand, Polygon, Tether, XRP) and use the coins that the entire globe can find a use for. It's important to understand why a crypto is created and it's intended exchange purposes. 

Please be mindful of such tactics as treating all cryptos like a casino.
Search loss porn. Granted it‚Äôs usually a drop in the bucket to those posting but it is still ‚Äòheard‚Äô.  Evidence of it going bad is out there just like the gain posts.
It isn't out yet. You can buy the original Ethereum on Coinbase and be put on a waitlist and they will convert your ETH to ETH 2.0. This is the only way I know. Someone correct me if I'm incorrect, please.
Count me in
I know someone who bought Bitcoin at $15. He has no crypto now and thinks it's a Ponzi scheme.
Nah thats complete BS by todays standards. They did this again and found out that there is no correlation with IQ or waiting for a reward.

You only have 1500 if you sold. Otherwise you have a pile of DOGE. Gains on paper are just paper until realized.

Stop-losses aren't foolproof tho, you can still get fucked while having them set
there is something called liquidity. Just saying
If the coin tanks and thousands try to sell at the same time your stop-loss isn't worth shit. It is good to have but in no way is it a fool-proof way of minimising your losses
Bingo. I have a rule. No more than a $50 investment into any crypto. That way in not losing a whole life savings on a gamble. If it grows, it grows. If it drops, I lost a tank of gas. Lol
It's 'should have', never 'should of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
Fuck off
Would be really cool if it had hundreds of those 1k to .01cent stories. Or maybe just 1 of them?
Well that‚Äôs the difference between gambling and investing, right?
Oh really? How about those that bought dogecoin at $0.7?
the average coin buyer can barely find a way to by DOGE so I wouldn't think is a problem any longer. These >1$ Surius coins with flash webgraphic presentations, confusing technical information and lofty mission statements seem far more dangerious than the 1 memcoin that can't break 1$ atm.  When it breaks 1$ then yeah, it's dangerous.

If you have fomo, just DCA ¬£100 a month or whatever you can afford. Get off the forums, delete the coin price apps and just start building up a normal cash saving pot.
If you keep trying to time the market all the time, you‚Äôll always be at a loss. 5 years of cash savings is better than nothing.
Stop trying to time the market with crypto, just buy and hold, and just turn on notifications if it passes your exit price points.

Look at Bonfire, it was literally at 0300 5 days ago. It has now 14x.

ikr. sill waiting for these hundreds of stories. And when it happens, and it will happen, its going to be with a SuriusCoin that already above $1 and real money can be lost. When DOGE is above $1 then drops below it, then there might be hundreds of stories. But theres not 1 story. He's using the warning story to pile on doge.

And these are the ""smart crypto investors"" subreddit with fake math and false stories.
That's the question, isn't it?
Right, and the word ""investment"" does not apply. You don't invest money in a slot machine, and you don't think of roulette wheel as a short-term investment either. It's gambling, that's all.
Not a great comparison at all bud. 

Yes there is risk involved with crypto, but it is nowhere near as random or predatory ad a casino lmao. You can safely bet the top 100 coins will give some kind of return if you hold long enough.

Look at Safemoon, lots of people claimed it was a scam or rugpull, and then (given enough time) it blasted through previous ATHs making a lot of people wealthy.

You just have to do your own research, find projects you believe in for the long term, and only invest what you can afford to lose.
I hurts to miss the btc train multiple times since 2012, then eth and now doge.
You can only sell if there's someone to buy on the other side, once the initial sell off begins that tanks the price at first, people try to sell but if there's no one to buy, you're stuck. Volume on random shitcoins can grind to a halt and you can just stare on your sell order not fulfilling.
My brother made 6k off of $30 bucks and he's shilling the hell out of it. I tried to warn him I've seen this before this might age like milk but that coins gonna break a lot of people.

It reached 65 earlier today so dumping in at 50 would have been one of potentially the best investments you could have made getting 20%+ returns. I say this as someone who has been talking myself out of investing in doge since it was .00004 and always convince myself it peaked. I still don't own any.
Go back to 2012 and buy btc
Isn‚Äôt that shit a scam?
Well it‚Äôs definitely still a meme lol. And most people don‚Äôt even own it. They have a third party like Robinhood they bought it on. Not in their wallet
Doge is a good meme.

Price rises cause of higher demand. Moment demand of coin is lower than supply regardless of how many people ""hodl"", prices deflate.

It's basically a zero sum game. Only way to ""win"" is to pray on many others losing. Wealth isn't created out of thin air when crypto coins are traded unlike stocks (has intrinsic price of company long term).

You should sell in profit while telling others to keep hodling or buying more. It's the only way to win with most of these coins mathematically.

This entire thing is a 'wealth transfer' system with extra steps and fees for the middle men (exchanges, etc). Mathematically, this is essentially the same as a pyramid scheme. Your success lies on other people's failures.

Dbet.  Had working ideas but Malta didn't want to give out gaming liecence to crypto companies.  Pritty much killed it there and then.
You swallowed ?
You did the right thing moving out of DOGE. No one could have predicted Elon's antics would skyrocket the coin. I looked at DOGE be .05 for months. Never thought anything of it. Moved to DGB, a real growth coin. 

Not sour I didn't buy DOGE and now its .60. Because that wasn't a smart play to throw money into a coin with terrible fundamentals
You will about to hear many with DOGE, unless the project really changes.

Someone has to see enough value in it to buy it from you. If there is no value then who are you going to sell it to?
But the dip!
I will say the only time I sell at a loss is if I know another coin is better suited to make that money back. Then you hodl till it does.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Yup. I bought dogecoins in April last year for around 5$. I already cashed out a few hundred $ and I still have some dogecoins left.
Thing is: 5 $ was a reasonable sum for me to invest into DOGE at this time. For rich people a few thousand dollars are play money just as the 5 $ is play money for me...
This needs to be shouted from the rooftops.

Want to make a million dollars in a month? Simple! Invest a billion.
Like Mark Cuban's 11 year old son being given 10k to put into doge. Kids going to spend his life thinking he earned it. SMH
I trade in the stock market, and there is a saying.  ""Buy the rumor,  sell the news"".
2300 doge was like 10 bucks 5 months ago (assuming it was at 0.005)
That‚Äôs how it always happens. For the ones that are broke and have to risk it all to hope for those gains and Do. Never see them. But the guy with loads of money can throw pocket change and double net worth. Smh
That‚Äôs how it felt about the gme shorting debacle. If you had 100k on Rh or whatever place in a portfolio sure you could buy tons of stock, but it takes 5 days to sign up and verify everything at lease so nobody Kate to the party could get in while it was worth doing.
I'm not really rich, but I put in a similar amount 5 months ago. There were some quiet signs, sometimes we just need to listen.
2300 was madness 4 or 5 months ago, nobody could have seen such an enormous growth with any kind of rationality
Fun fact. It has nothing to do with that. His friend either got lucky with his timing, or he knows how crypto actually works. I promise if you everyone goes back and reads the original white paper/code/notes from Satoshi. You‚Äôll realize it‚Äôs not random. Neither are alt coins. 

Crypto and economics is about being smart. Not rich.
Exactly. Also when something is only worth 0.01c  or so it is easier for it to jump up to 50c than it is to jump from 50c to $25, $25 to $1250 and so on and so on, so the early investors will always proportionately gain more than those who invest 'late' based on past performance and hype...

Another example of ""don't follow the sheeple"". Once you've read about it in the news and 1 man's tweets can fluctuate a market value so wildly, it's already burnt out. Like RUNNN!!! SELL!!!

I pussied out and cancelled my DOGE order for approximately $1,400/ 19,800 shares back in February. 

My reasoning: I made my first money playing stocks in SNDL. Sold @ $2/share when it tanked. How it went from so high to dropping like a lead balloon scared me. 

Had I gone through with my DOGE purchase I would have pocketed about 18k but I got scared off by my previous experience in regards to SNDL volatility. 

My friend bought literally at the peak. I can remember how he told me that I need to get back in and that DOGE is going to ""$10"". I told him my concerns. A lady I was talking to had a son who said ""buy and hold"". She was wise, she said ""there will something new next year"". 

For the reasons first stated, I passed. VERY happy I didn't have FOMO and become a bag holder.
Much wow
Yea the math doesn‚Äôt add up.  Four or five months ago wouldn‚Äôt have net $2300 to $1.2M.  $23,000 would have netted a return like that 4/5 months ago would net around $1.3M in returns.  Let‚Äôs say he bought it at .008805 which was the price of Doge on 01/10/21 if he bought $2300 and sold at .50 he would have net $130,000+ which is right around 5 months range.   Even if he bought in December 22nd at .003788 selling at .50 would net $300,000+ which is an amazing return and nothing to scoff at but not in the million range.  So he either got in earlier than 4/5 months or put more skin in the game to make that kind of number
He got in way before .01... He got in at like .0003
I've heard a few things about safemoon. I'll have to do some did. Thanks for the tip
I was assuming when he got in, because he said it was stimulus money he invested. I suppose it could have been from the first round. I dunno. I do know he showed his account balance and I was jealous
Indeed! I guess it's time to buy more
Quite possible. He said he used his stimulus money, and he showed me a sell order, but it's very possible he had invested other chunks at various points. He's been talking about doge and other coins for a while. His newest hype is safemoon, but he's an active investor. I'm sure this week cost him a lot in theoretical money.
Of course. I never suggested it was some master stroke of investment. Dude plays markets. He wins sometimes.
Yeah. When you have just enough to survive, you don't invest. That's where I'm at currently. I have enough for rent, and insurance, and food, and all the basics. But not enough to invest.

My friend, was a former meth head in high school, and began working as a laborer as he got clean. He found a proclivity for low voltage work, and installed exterior lighting, and then interior, and then audio visual set ups, and then security systems, and it has progressed over the last twenty years. He came from absolute dog shit nothing, and built a 20m/ yr business that nets him around an m, plus his vehicles and travel, and everything he does is paid by the company. I'm proud of my dude. I've known him for thirty years, and he's not the guy you would have guessed would be the boss.
I'm a poor person. I make 50k a year in the SF bay area. I put 600 in safemoon
I dunno man... He showed me his screen with his total doge investment, and he showed me his current value. He filled in the blanks. If the numbers don't match exactly, then sue me. It doesn't matter to me, it's not my money. Nevertheless, I'm happy for my dude, because he came back from meth use in his early twenties, to owning his own business, employing 3-5 people full time, having a beautiful wife and three kids and for generally living the American dream. If I misremembered what the exact number was, or if I looked at the wrong line, I apologize. Either way, the message was the same.
I don't know all of the specifics of his crypto investments, I only know what he told me and what he showed me. Maybe he'd made previous buys. I dunno. I know he certainly was happy about it
As said in previous comments, I don't know the full details of his portfolio, he just showed me his balance and bragged about it being off doge. I don't even know if he sold at peak or anything. It was just cool to see.
My comment was from 6 months ago, and he had invested 4 or 6 months before that.

  


It's been pointed out that he probably already had some in his account from before, but he showed me his portfolio, and it was indeed worth over a million when he showed me, and it was almost entirely doge. I don't know if he sold it at the peak or if he rode it out... It was just amazing to see, and made me jealous at the time
I got you. I turned that free $30 from coinbase into $3. I am the wolf of cryptocurrency
I put $1 into Robinhood and got a free stock worth 4.99. I sold that and put it into DOGE, and was able to withdraw $3.28 back out to my bank from my initial $1 investment. I can‚Äôt ever withdraw the other 4.99 though, so I think I‚Äôll leave it in and live off the gains.
See we all just need to think like apes and risk it all then we‚Äôd all be rich.
I turned the free Robinhood stock into 30$ of doge, I'm literally the next Warren Buffett and my advice is to get fucked up and do no research. All of that thinking only slows down how many trades you could be doing every minute.
If you did your whole life's savings you coulda had 2 whole life's savings.
I bought $15 worth of Doge at 2 cents and sold for a decent return at almost 8 cents.

Kicking myself now.

With those numbers you'll be sliding into peoples' DMs offering to trade for them with amazing returns.
My wife turned her free stock($3.50) into $80 by hitting bitcoin and doge coin right. Seems it's better to not play with it.

Don't listen to this guy. I bought doge when it was at .0028 and sold when it was .0032, made my $20
Next time just use more capital. If you had invested 5 mil you'd have made 5.1 mils. Amateur mistake.
There are seriously people in my DMs asking for financial advice. Please don't do that. I'm an idiot and I don't know what I'm doing.
Thats enough to start educating people on youtube!
That's not financial advice, once I bought $500 doge and now I have 185...
Don't listen to him, hit me up... Don't go to the moon! To the pavement!!!
Can ever dogie reach $1? Just curious I don‚Äôt own any dogie though ü•¥
I turned $11 into $5 by day trading doge on Robinhood. Don‚Äôt hit me up for any kind of advice.
Being very honest here, I put 2$ into doge and felt like a literal god amongst men when I turned into 10$. Then it hit me if I put 1k (which I had) I would have really benefited a wholeeee lot more
My buddy got a free share of PLUG when it was like $4, it mooned to $70 at one point and he brags about that being the best investment he‚Äôs made lol
Just the fact that your using robinhood is enough to never wanna ask you for financial help.

If you become a success at something while being born and raised on third base, fuck you, I'm not listening. Anyone who started at the bottom and worked their way up, let's talk. 

Except you, Vlad of Robinhood. Take your ""boy in Bulgaria"" stories and shove them up your ass. Sideways.
Not to mention Gates has access to his parents networks of industry contacts. While Zuck had wealthy parents. They went to Harvard to network for their companies and work on their product with like minded people. They got success and dropped out because their business was already successful enough to warrant their full attention.
They were also top performing students. Their success was backed by a lot of things, people just really like the feel good story.
Not that.
Also they had the idea, the right moment, the right era.
If there were no crazy credit requirements those guys would have graduated in 5 semesters. They just said fuck it with their final classes cause starting their company was a better use of their time. Pretty sure they took more than 3 years of classes.

Relevant xkcd: https://xkcd.com/1827/
And it also unfortunately gives us all those lovely stories where people claim that a god or goddess saved them from a horrific car accident that they should have ""definitely died in"" 

It's amazing to me how many ""miracle"" stories I had to sit through as a kid in church, I didn't have a name for it back then but it always rubbed me the wrong way because I knew, I *knew* that for every person that was miraculously saved by God from a falling brick or something there were 10 that dies from choking on a pretzel and never got to tell their tale of dying from something ridiculous.
Good modern example could be paraphrased as ‚Äúhands up anyone here who has died of covid. See?  Fake virus ‚Äú.
Thanks for the explanation
My favorite example is thinking the beers left in a fridge are what we should buy more of.  No, those are the ones noone drank, you want to know what ran out first.
Yes, we get to see all the fantastic Roman architecture but you‚Äôll never see what a peasants home looked like!!
Survivorship bias is the reason why I'm a pessimist, and the reason I find some people who only seems to focus on successful people, with stars in their eyes while talking about them annoying.
Good man
Also when you say : ""It happens to me ALL THE TIME"" but actually you don't even realize when it doesn't happen, you only focus on the times it happened
pretty sure daniel tosh has a good joke that represents that:
""you're never gonna be famous. never. you have no chance. I didnt get here because I work hard. i have a gift from god. Everyone gets their 15 minutes of fame buddy...15? thats an average. thats 0 for you, you, you, you, zero, zero, zero, 20 years (points to self) zero, zero, zero.""

Whenever someone points to how so and so got famous and how they got to that point and wish to emulate that. Its takes a lot of risk, determination and LUCK since there are hundreds who did the same thing but missed the last part. If getting rich was easy, everyone would be rich.
There was this kid who won around $200 million on the lottery a few years back who claims he manifested then win because he visualised it beforehand.  But what about the millions of others that buy tickets and pray and visualise great they‚Äôll hit the big one and never win shit? Heh

I've got one about a token I bought that was gaining traction in 2018, it was called Insolar (INS).

Insolar was focused on cutting out the middlemen in the entire supply chain market. Basically no more buying in the supermarket, but directly from suppliers with the implementation of warehouses where people could personally pick up the orders. This would cut the costs of the middlemen and thus create a cheaper purchase for the buyer and more profit for the seller.

It seemed like a niche idea, but I could see it working out on a realistic scale. Due to the bear market and the overall negative impact on image of cryptocurrencies, the project lost several key partnerships. The Insolar team tried to change things up to revive the project, but this pretty much fucked the token even more as these changes caused exchanges such as Binance to start delisting the token.

At the end, the team called it quits and shut down the network. They gave the option to burn your tokens for an airdrop of a new DeFi project launching soon, but at an extremely low valuation. Anyone who didn't migrate his/her tokens through the wallet has basically no access to their holdings anymore on the official Insolar wallet, as it has been shut down and exchanges don't support trading anymore.
I remember my small investments on bounty0x and dragonchain.

Maybe they will pump in 2025? Lol
He fomo'd in 2017 & ended up with half his coins unlisted...
Just projects without fundamentals that died in months or in a year. 

Most of the projects you see launched this monthh won't survive the first year. 

If it includes the word SAFE or MOON in the name, not more than 3 months.
They had value at some point, but exchanges have gone bankrupt, and coins have been totally abandoned/scammed.
Taint coins ain‚Äôt no good
Yup, I sold doge at a break even in February but I've since invested more into really solid projects, if I had kept that doge I wouldn't have bought BTC or ETH, I kick myself for not holding on but I was glad to be shot of it at the time.
Definitely true.  It especially hurts when you calculate out how much one could have made in those situations.  

At that point though, I turn it into a learning opportunity and try my best to understand the most effective way to produce a more favorable outcomes in the future rather than dwelling on the specific time I missed out.  

I've found that works for me at least.
Answer your door, will ya?  I bought this hammer for you....
I think it is fine to still discuss it on forums and with your inner circles. The problem is disclosing how much you own and the value of your assets. How many of our friends do we discuss our exact salary or how much cash we have on hand? Cyrpto and stocks are no different. Yes, we can discuss our 401k, Roth IRA, and other investments with friends or family members but never disclose details.
Probably one reason why we don‚Äôt know who Satoshi is
Yup. Totally agree.
The only time I ever got hacked was when I was openly talking about crypto online.
I don't talk about my mediocre gains in any investment with anyone unless I'm anonymous. Suddenly you're the bank with interest free loans and penalty free missed payments.
This right here. There's a huge field behind my property and if I ever win big in crypto, I'm buying it, pushing my house far back into it and shunning most of the world.
Until reach that goal, keep moon farming üòé

Anyone on this sub isn't rich (yet)
Or, you would post on here about what you would do ‚Äúif‚Äù you had decent money in crypto to throw us off the scent. Nice try OP
I wouldn't share my balance(if i had a large one), but i definitely do share the benefits of crypto. Most are hearing about it from the perspective of btc and doge, so they think the way to make money is get lucky on a coin or simply hold it and they will get rich.

There is so much in the way of defi. Most people don't understand when i tell them you can make more in a week with LP farms than you can on a 6 (or lets be honest, even a 12) month CD.
When I was a kid, my dad always said if he won the lottery, he wouldn't tell anyone out of fear that someone would kidnap us for ransom.
A smart thing to do.
Just gotta keep that blicky on u
I've seen quite a bunch of new people keen to see a new bear market to buy in cheap, but I don't think they realize what they'd be getting into.

It'll be just like last time where people will predict 'bottom', only for it to drop further and further with no reversal in sight. Many will lose hope again and will sell again.

Generally in life it's always easy to talk about what you'd do in a certain situation, until you're actually in it.
The other day when bitcoin slumped I googled articles to speculate and found one from 2018 arguing why bitcoin will never go back to the high of 20k again.  Aged like milk.
Also easier if you start with 900k
The first 10k is the hardest!

Edit: I just wanted to add that comparing yourself to others, unless used purely for motivation, is unhealthy. We all start somewhere. Most of the people you see toting these huge gains started with one small investment. I started with $500, and there are plenty who have made more starting with less. 

Also, thank you for the award. :)
The easiest is turning 100m into 1 m I can do that for free
How do you easily turn into a millionaire? Start a billionaire and try timing the market...
It's not easy to 10x an investment no matter how much you start with.
It's easy if you have 100k to play with (10x isn't that crazy considering the current environment). Not so much if it is your life savings that you worked years for.
You need to teach me how to turn that 100 to 1m lol
Getting a millionaire is also easier if you start with a trillion ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Easiest if you start with 2m
I started with 2m. I‚Äôm almost at 1m. Am I doing it right?
It's hard right now, many people probably bought at least 10 ETH during 2018 bear market and let's say they sell it once we hit $10k per ETH and then what? stocks are pumped as fuck and they can implode any time and crypto will follow along them, so you either wait for the next crash and rebuy crypto with that $100k hoping we won't have much longer bear market because of that retail mania or hope they stop printing so stocks will crash.
ya but imagine goin wrong losing 500k.... a true nightmare for every normal day guy
Much easier if you start with 2 million
Thank you for making me feel better ü§ù
And starting with ¬£10M makes it trivial.
even easier if you start with 2m
It's REALLY easy if you start with 999,999.99
Sigh the reality of this hurts. You can make so much more money if you have more money. The more you got the more you make...wait actually i feel uplifted saying this hey it does pay to save
Easiest to make 1m if you start with 2m, though!
It's even easier if you start with a small $1 000 000 loan
Easiest if you start with 1m

That‚Äôs a thing I keep forgetting to remind myself when I kick myself sometimes for selling to early. Sure it sucks that I sold at X instead of Z, who‚Äôs to say I wouldn‚Äôt have sold at Y which is halfway between. 


It must be extraordinarily rare for someone to have bought so much BTC when it was dirt cheap and not let go of a single one til now.
I mined 24 btc for shits and giggles back when btc was worthless.

Cashed out at $15k during the initial spike. Could be a millionaire now off of letting my computer mine overnight occasionally, but I got a house, and debt free out of it cashing out when I did. Worked out well for me. Not bummed about it.
Indeed, sold most of my dogecoin (400k) at 0.05

For most people, 10k$ is huge, 100k$ is life-changing

Not many people can hold to these huge numbers without selling. This shit is stressful
I was kind of an og bitcoiner and I actually spoke against it for a long time because I lost it all on a very popular exchange back in the day and had no way of getting it back. Still salty lol it was only 7 btc because I was a broke kid but prob would‚Äôve changed my life to some degree.
I bought $100 when it was $0.065 for funsies. It was only $100 so it was always going to be ‚Äúeven if I lose it all, I had fun watching it‚Äù money. I originally set a limit sell of $.98 (thinking everyone that was ‚ÄúDOGE to $1‚Äù would get out beforehand). 

It got up to $.42 and then crashed back down to $.3-something. I set a limit of $.40 so ‚Äúif it ever gets near its ATH, I‚Äôm out.‚Äù It hit that earlier this week and I was out ending up with $600. Am I bummed I didn‚Äôt wait till $.75? Sure. But I also never could have known it was going to blow past its previous ATH and I have realized real gains, not just watched them evaporate by not getting out in time. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs another way to play this or you‚Äôll drive yourself crazy.
I know 2 people that didn‚Äôt. One is a secret millionaire right now still working a 9-5 livable wage job and using his work income to pay the bills and live and his millions sparsely on everything else. 

The other still holds his coins and only plans to sell when he retires. Dude needed new car tires recently and put them on credit instead of taking out some cash. 

The discipline of both are amazing. I like to think I‚Äôd be more like guy number 1 if I ever hit it big.

What exactly happened to the pizza guy?
It all depends on how much you want to spend, I guess.
When a 25% increase on your total investment after a few months is regarded as a bad investment, you just know the market isn't in a healthy spot.

Other markets would kill for those kind of gains, but in the crypto space it's currently regarded as self-evident, as if there's no risk attached of actually losing money.
Made 40% gains in not even 1.5 months. Just stuck to BTC, ETH and XRP.
bitcoin remained kinda stable, but etherium ist carrying like hell.
We are! I started with $150 in eth, $100 in ada, and $100 in doge. I‚Äôm at like $785ish now.
Started at @ $150 in  Doge Feb 1st currently $1200. Of my original 3000 coins I've got 250 left, sold at certain points to diversify. Absolutely lmao as I'm not sure what the fuck I'm doing.
Started with $1000 made $200 then threw in 4K not I‚Äôm -$3800 be careful my friends. Grown your original bank roll until you know what you are doing. Or just yolo and ball out I don‚Äôt care this is Reddit do what you want
I have the same problem. I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll ever sell, because I know when I do that shits going to skyrocket and I‚Äôll be crying in a corner with my hundred dollar bill.
Not impossible then, you already have your upper limits. Sell before ETH reaches $10k and BTC reaches $100k. The bubble will be about ready to pop by then.

Yeah but most do sell on the way back down and capitulate, but I get your point. That's also assuming the crypto trend will continue ticking up. I hope it does but the track record isn't very long.
üò¢
$400 of BTC at 52 cents each would be over $46 million today. 

I'm assuming you made a typo there lol.
This is the correct view in my opinion. I've thrown some money that won't put me in financial straights too lose into a few crypto and I'm already down 200. Will I lose it all? I hope not but I'm not dumping at this point. Worst case scenario it turns into a decent tax break.
I did this with Doge, I sold off enough at 60 odd cents to cover all my investments into crypto. Now I'm playing the game with the houses money - so to speak.
I only put money in that I‚Äôm willing to lose. 

I‚Äôll hodl waiting for a better profit but if it doesn‚Äôt come about at the end of the day I‚Äôve only lost the money I was originally willing to lose.

So yeah, I feel confident hodling.
Exactly. I‚Äôm a paper-handed bitch, but I‚Äôm sitting on 3x profit overall from 2017-now, sooooo.... /shrug
Everyone saying HODL forever, be it for crypto or GME or whatever is either a shill or are stooging for shills.
Everyone wants a winning lottery ticket.
It‚Äôs good to have a well-defined trading strategy+exit plan on a coin you don‚Äôt intend to hodl. But if you take a long term view in the value of a particular coin, you‚Äôll do much better hodling until your view changes
Doesn't any part of you wonder ""what if"" though? You could sell 90% and just keep 10% just-in-case stock
That's the thing. I HODL the big ones, but if i make even a little on a shit coin it's rolled into somethin else fast
I think you‚Äôll be disappointed with the outcome of this. I believe it will be a non event. I sold out most of my doge last week after being up nearly 400%, will let the rest ride. Hopefully I‚Äôm wrong and it goes to $1 üòÇ
Boy do I have news for you lol. Still holding?
Oof, not looking great
Only reason why I'm holding now myself. I spent $50 at .25 cents - left over money that was already allocated for some cheap options on RH, so even if Doge goes to $0, it's no skin off my ass.
You're in for a really good surprise. I may or may not have knowledge that there will be a drastically good announcement that will send Doge to the moon. Much higher than $1, $10, $100...

edit: [to those who doubted doge was going to the moon](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22427588/spacex-dogecoin-satellite-doge-1-to-the-moon)
This made me so happy. Your investment benefited your dogs and made their world so much better, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about, not hoarding capital
Very happy for you and your dogs.
I cashed out half my dogecoin this morning. I only had $50 but I made 13x my profit. I‚Äôm poor and this makes a difference for me. I do feel regret but then I also feel relief that if it crashes to earth, then at least I get something for my family. Especially because it is Mother‚Äôs Day in Australia today.
Ambition isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm talking about. Ambition is having a vision and going for it. You could even say that part of that is analyzing your decisions to see if there was a better outcome in order to improve.

Greed is winning a little and then being mad you didn‚Äôt win the maximum. You see this in all forms of gambling, especially poker. ‚ÄúWell let‚Äôs just see the next card‚Äù... it doesn‚Äôt inform the strategy at all. The right decision is the one that gave you the best odds at the time, not the one that gave the maximum outcome. Bad decisions that give good results is called luck, not skill or ambition.
Except the only ‚Äúambition‚Äù some people have is to buy a ‚Äúguaranteed lottery ticket‚Äù by clicking a mouse button. That‚Äôs not ambition, it‚Äôs laziness mixed with greed.
How do you figure out the projection? I typically target stuff that‚Äôs down and go for a 10-15% gain but it usually goes up 60% and I sold ‚Äúearly‚Äù
r/iamverysmart
You got me nervous I got no DMs today
Same boat, but if crypto teaches you anything, it's not regretting over what you could have done, instead envy on what you have done.
Idk about $20. You can use a bitcoin/ethereum ATM or a friend who is willing to sell you some. Open a wallet first and go there and figure out how it works. The fees are gross for ATMs though. There's other in person bitcoin sales but that's a bit sketchy for someone new to crypto.

The first crypto I got was from a friend, about $10 worth. And the second batch was from an ATM.

Then register at a few exchanges. Eg. Kraken, Coinbase, Binance. Go with more than one, even when they have bad reviews like BinanceUS does. It's free to register. When you wanna you can figure out which to actually use. Eventually, you'll have enough money to bank transfer fiat into the exchange and you'll be glad you planned ahead.

Also there are things like Coinbase Earn and Coinmarketcap Earn.

Lol, if you gamble with your last money, you're an idiot
and they could have even more easily just bought a scratch ticket down 7/11.....the problem ain't crypto, it's the people.
This makes me want a crypto loss porn sub.
A lot of those seem to be rich people indirectly bragging who brush it off. Not sure it really helps people who aren't well off realize they're not in the situation those people are in and doing a similar high risk bet means hitting zero or a bunch of debt, not ""just lost 20k, lol, doing the same risky bet again!""

The greater fool theory.
That's something I always thought about.

I buy low and sell high? Great.

But who is selling low and buying high which makes my actions possible?
What's so bad about talking about it?
It's part of the stock market/ crypto in general.

If they don't understand it, then don't invest. Same goes for people only expecting to turn a profit and never thinking they could make a poor investment.

They aren't the bad guys for profiting.

Ever heard of fd‚Äôs?
Remember bitconnect?
Leverage exists and I have heard of stories of people going into negatives
Yeah I‚Äôve cashed in on the doge hype. Lots of people always going off about holding to get the price up but in reality if you wanna make anything you gotta dump when the whales dump and buy when the whales buy. If you don‚Äôt your just holding on for nothing and the price is gonna keep going up and down all the time. Sure I won‚Äôt make a killing but an extra few hundred a month can go a long way for the average person
Only worthless thing here is your comment.
Investing with a long time horizon in ETFs or mutual funds is about as safe as it gets. Now there's no such thing as truely safe but the market always recovers
By degrees. I mean a market tracker is *fairly* safe *long term*. But never any guarantees.
Time and property. God isnt making any more of those.
It took me two and a half years of grinding my 9 to 5, pinching every penny and having zero fun to make it back, but yes, I‚Äôm good now.
People don‚Äôt realize you actually don‚Äôt always get to sell at your stop loss in a volatile and nose diving market.
Unless your exit strategy is a conscious ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs an exit strategy?‚Äù you should always have an exit strategy. 

If you choose ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs an exit strategy‚Äù be aware all those gains are probably going to disappear
Goodluck trying to convince them though. No one wants to repeat the past of selling early so everyone's HODLing. It's just creating a worse bubble than last time.
I bought $100 in doge early enough for a nice profit, but I haven't figured out how I can turn it back into my currency üòÇ
Holy-shit, let me tell about stop losses. If you don't set up a limit-sell or sell at market, you better know how to setup your trailing stops or stop-sell correctly with a capital fucking *C*.  Not to mention proper various fill-type. The market can literally run you right over leaving you with the bag after a %15-35 dip. Now you're stuck. I think I was supposed to get out with a $200 dollar profit which ended up being an $800 loss overnight and I thought I did everything correctly.  


The first time that happened to me, I knew right away a lot of people were going to be fucking up their trades crypto/security trading. Its not a game, you really gotta know your platform and your finance/trading stuff, even for the simple things
Probably shiba. A dude on my fb that invests in every shitcoin instead of real tokens backed by technology posted about it. He always posts when one goes up and all his dumb friends beg to know how to get in lol.
Dogecoin?
1000% gain in a day. I‚Äôm having a blast.
I have spent years DCAing into BTC with my hard earned money and a friend of mine goes ""lol why not?"" and get the same %gains as me in a day. Yeah, I'm slightly annoyed. I know I shouldn't be, but I am.

Yeah people think this current market is wild, but this is just scratching the surface. Large institutions are already getting very very interested in the technology, especially smart contracts, and they know they're gonna have no choice but to start hoarding crypto. Once this starts, it's gonna trigger a multi trillion dollar global snowball, per se.
Yah. I hope etherium can revolutionize the way I do my communes.
Lots of people do 

Ignore the idiots
True or they did margin trading
Congrats since when did you start?
Wel it Just pumped lol cash out
The taxes aren't horrible if you're doing something like turning 20k into 60k. More or less whatever for me. It's a job like any other. at that point.
We have something similar in the US. If you hold for more than a year your taxes are significantly reduced.
I'd rather pay taxes than have a loss to write off - but that's just me
I love Ada too, the project looks amazing and Charles is a great dude
Have faith little one
Same here, I'm holding long term on ADA, it's a great project that deserves success. I did see a post here the other day saying the potential of it's price isn't as high as other coins but I'm not 100% on the validity of that.
You shouldn't be down voted. If you understand math, you know doge can't last. It's bad for crypto to have something like doge blowing up. Lots of legit projects out there that should be getting more attention than doge. I'm ready for the down votes but pop a reminder on here for 5 years from now when doge is <0.10
At this point I'm worried that a crash in doge is a huge crash for Cryptocurrency in general, I've got about two thirds out, but the more doge goes up the more nervous I am about that last third. I can't take any argument that cryptocurrency isn't a bubble seriously while doge is worth this much.
It is crazy that people actually think you can just turn 11k into 22k in a few WEEKS without a lot of luck involved. You can do as much research and clever trading as you want. Double the money in a few weeks means you just gambled and got lucky.

But the people who got lucky will never see it that way. It will always be their hard work and not luck.
Yeah just the exchanges in my country that does not list shiba
Idk what i was thinking to be honest but i learnt a lesson

Just wait a day or two.
I just emptied my savings account and put all of it into doge. It's going to make me rich.
That wallet belongs to Robinhood, who inexplicably have a single wallet for all customers holding doge
what u/OkHuckleberry7877 said. RH moves funds around internally. That is not included in the on-chain volume. So if you wanna look at it like that, DOGE only becomes more liquid.
Smart play
With the current profit you could make about 8 bucks a day mining ETH, but profits are pretty high now so expect around 5. As long as you undervolt and keep temps down its pretty safe, might wear out fans a bit sooner and maybe the card will fail after 4 years instead of 5 for example, should OC memory to get the most out of it. Very easy to do if you already have a wallet, just download a miner and config it to a pool of your choosing, like Ethermine. In June with EIP1559 profits are expected to go down a bit though
Not sure what the difficulty is right now but I'd suspect you'd be able to get ~0.5 ETH per year. I had two of these cards mining and managed to make out with ~0.1 ETH every month. That was in 2017. This was with a mining group. Everyone split the proceeds depending on the hashrate of your machines. Not to mention if you are paying your own electricity you'll have to factor that. I had an apartment at the time where electricity was I included but my landlord noticed a huge increase in his bill that year and he freaked out on me. He didn't know I was mining on his dime. That's part of the reason I stopped mining.

There's a website that will calculate power usage with the hashrate of your machine and potential profit given the market rate of the crypto you are mining. ETH may still be worth it, but I wouldn't just do it without understanding the full cost. Mining is not free. You are still buying ETH. Maybe you aren't physically in a mine with a pickaxe but you have to work more at your regular job to pay for your computer's effort.
A 2080ti is not a ‚Äúmediocre‚Äù GPU.
Most never survive. 99% of the coins from the 2017 boon are not even second thoughts now. That's always the case. It was the case in 2013, it was the case in 2017, and it will be the case again this year. Only a handful have proven staying power. I'd wager that this year the few to keep an eye on for strong long term staying power is ETH and ADA. Those who are already proven (and yes I don't think ETH is completely proven yet), would be BTC, LTC, BCH, XRP (sigh), and yes, Doge. ETH still have a major couple of revisions coming up that will be an important thing to keep an eye on. If it can get through that ok, I'd say it has long term staying power. ADA has a lot of promise, but it needs some serious real world productivity. That test is coming very soon so keep an eye on it. Doge has always been around, and with the insane trade volume of it this cycle, it's here to stay. XRP has been around since the beginning and at this point I doubt it's going anywhere. And Litecoin has also been around since the beginning. The first ""alt coin cryptocurrency"" and the only alt coin left from that first era. It has a purpose, and does it extremely well and it's everywhere Bitcoin is.

Nearly all the ""new hotness"" this time around will be dead and gone too. Happens every time. Throwing money into all these is gambling. Your chances of gains during this part of the cycle are much higher regardless of what project you throw money at. But for long term holding you are *absolutely* gambling. So the best way to make money is to invest long term in crypto with staying power, and short term fun money in all the other garbage and get out before it's too late.
Dogecoin is the new pyramid scheme, don‚Äôt actually produce anything but make money by trying to convince enough other people it‚Äôs a good investment
If he thinks Doge is going to hit another 10x I just... Feel sad for him and his friend.

Ah, safe
Yesterday I heard a conversation like this in a Starbucks and another one at the grocery store. Like, what the heck is going on??

This is the most incoherent story I‚Äôve ever read.
I think it is all about picking ones that have solid dev teams, are churning out products and services while also planning disruptive future products. It really is a dice roll though, in crypto and with the stock market. Hell, take Raven the chimp, Top 25 money managers by throwing darts at a wall of stocks.

Not everything with fundamentals and a grand vision will make it, but there are still quite a few low cap gems that survived the bear market and are still building like mad.

I personally pick projects that are building either necessary tech or disruptive tech at this point. Are they trying to fix a broken issue in the real world or improve an existing process that is lagging behind? They are as solid a choice for long term holds as anything else,

https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-successful-chimpanzee-on-wall-street
Hold and if there‚Äôs a crash dca into it. If you had done that with eth or a handful of the promising crypto projects from 2017 you would have made a fortune.  2017 holders are being rewarded for their faith in the projects they chose and in the crypto space in general.   The key, of course is finding a good project to believe in.
Focus on tangible results and applications. If all they have are flashy words and promises of the future than sell while you're ahead, buy some ETH/BNB and rethink your original trading plan
You can try searching if a crypto project already has a working service, and a need for their coin. Personally like Travala (invested) and GET (not invested), because they tick those boxes and keep on working on adoption, but those are just 2 examples.
> How do you differentiate a good project from a bad when the vast majority are promises of future services

Usually connections. I have a close friend who works on crypto startups so I don't have to bother absorbing all the financial information to know what's legit. I try to, because it is interesting.
maybe *some* people disagreed. But you also have to agree that many, many of those people didn't get *unlucky* they just don't understand how to read the market factors. 

They way you make it sound, it's impossible to make a wrong investing decision - you can only get unlucky, which.. nah

And again, hard disagree on there being *no* objective method to tell a good from bad project... That's just... What? Makes zero sense
I was playing around with GPT-3 and had a similar conversation:

Impressive wisdom if you ask me.
Enron stock to the moon!
This is the way
Hey that's good! I keep hearing the squeeze isn't squoze... Hope y'all succeed!

A lot of people did capitulate and sold at a loss too though.
I'm bagholding 6 shares, fuck it.  If nothing happens by the end of summer (theres still room for a squeeze because the rules aren't in place yet and we still are waiting on votes, which may inspire a margin call) I'll sell 5, keep one, and put the money in crypto.

Its massively manipulated so there is a chance it will continue to be manipulated and a squeeze never happens, but Ill have one share left anyway to profit from if it does
If you watch crypto, they all move in the same suspicious ways. These enteties have been hoarding crypto for a long time with the very intention of repeatedly pumping and dumping the market using bots. 

But all that means is that you're on a literall rollercoaster with guranteed dips *and* peaks. The downside is we don't know who the fuck is pressing the buttons, but I know when they make money, I make money as long as I hold out through the dips.
House money is the best money. During the bull run of 2017, I put up a fair amount. After 5x, I pulled out twice my original investment, converted all my alts into BTC and ETH, and basically forgot about it for a few years. I probably checked on it twice a year, just to add it to my calculations of net worth. Was a nice surprise to see this year's boom
Yes!! This is the way! And on top of that you now have cash available to take advantage of the dips. And in case of emergency so you don‚Äôt end up forced to sell during a dip.
Great approach
Especially for dogecoin or other memecoins. Much better and more useful currencies out there, it won't stay high for long. Don't want to scare you into selling, that's your own decision but the downfall will likely be quick so keep an eye out for it.
Pretty much lmao
Agreed! I hope it gets people ""in the door"" for crypto. Once in, and if ambitious enough to learn, they'll make their way to other cryptos.
Roughly about 2 weeks in, I began to switch and have gone very deep into ETH.

I saw the AMC & GME stuff; I saw literally everyone saying DOGE and went after it. I made about $300 off roughly $500 investment. Then I realized quickly that the chance of it being a sustainable BTC thing was zero. 

I also knew if I was going to justify investing in this to the wife (she's in finance) I need a compelling logical reason other than a bunch of people said it would go to the moon.
Personally, the infinite supply is why I decided to move away from DOGE. If you're not constantly working to get more, then your piece of the pie will just get smaller and smaller. They would have to fork DOGE to have a limited supply or either burn some tokens from the tx fees like ethereum will be doing soon.

Also, I know most of the people buying doge are really just buying it on Robinhood and have absolutely no way to actually use the stuff and in the long run that's only good for speculation, not long term adoption. At this rate, it's still a memecoin and all those people would be much better off buying ethereum and learning how to use the technology and interact with smart contracts.
I'm a self employed digital nomad that just sells tshirts online from a small island in the Gulf of Thailand. I have absolutely zero interest in being an ""influencer"". This island is filled with them and many seem somewhat miserable *off camera*. No thanks.
How many of those 25% were part of the 75% in the past though?

&#x200B;

But hey, if you're happy, that's all you ever need in life.
No, no, he's got a point!
You‚Äôd be shocked. Beyond folks panicking at a dip and cut losses at bad times, many folks cost themselves cause they got caught up in the gains and don‚Äôt form an exit strategy. It‚Äôs why you see so much loss porn or folks crying after every r/wallstreetbets boom and why so many are constantly desperate to hit it big. Buying into a boom is only half the challenge. The other part is selling before the hype dies which can catch you totally blindsided. 

Whenever something like this happens, you can bet big players are contributing to the surge. But Once a big holder for various stocks/assets decides to cash out, the price will drop fast and hard before you can react. Doesn‚Äôt take long at all for unrealized gains to vanish before your eyes.

Literally saw this in March with GME‚Äôs second pop. Was climbing its way to 350, then some big spender cashed out, a halt occurred, and before you know it fell straight down to 198.

You don‚Äôt lose until you sell but you don‚Äôt profit til ya sell either. That‚Äôs the real reason many folks advise not to bet too hard on things like this (at least what you can‚Äôt afford to lose). Our emotions are a powerful force and often screw us over at the worst moment and crazes like this are prime moments for that to happen. I was trying to flip penny stocks for a good while and I can‚Äôt count all the times I let juicy gains slip through my fingers cause everything went into the crapper before I knew it. It‚Äôs also why people advise to find good investments and hold for a long while. Helps guard against on the spot volatility and helps you feel better about eventually cashing in.
I am on a x40 meme coins. Rich with crypto poor regarding bank account. 
It is money only when you cash out :)
The point is nobody lost money unless you sold low or bought bitconnect or some other unknown coins.
If you expect a buyer when you‚Äôve only held the coin for less than a week, or a month, you‚Äôve got other problems. You haven‚Äôt lost money just because you couldn‚Äôt hold until your asset appreciates a bit. 

You‚Äôre talking about it like the price is going to reset and never recover, when in fact you don‚Äôt really know much. You‚Äôd be lying otherwise.
The thing is, they are buying and selling within the same week, or within a month or two. How impatient can you be? How can no one not see the amount of hype and popularity this thing is generating? When I hear my uncle mention it randomly cause he heard it on the most popular radio in my city... its a no brainer. 

These other gamble shots, like CumRocket or SafeScam, those are the ones you have to watch minute by minute almost, I have no idea why people would be even putting money into them. I made up the name SafeScam based off SafeMoon but I bet both coins exist.

Thats not really ""bad luck"". It's willfull ignorance and blind greed.
If you sold early and bought BNB in February then yes, it has almost been a tie in performance since then, with the riskier investment being doge for sure. But playing it safe obviously will lead to lower returns. For the record I am also an advocate for BNB. It‚Äôs a very good bet. With huge potential still with the Binance Smart Chain.

That's a lazy take. It seemed obvious that doge would go up quite a bit just from looking at celebs talking about it to the growth on reddit subs to even advertisements for it. 
Just like any other investment stock or otherwise recognizing the trends and selling at a profit is a wise investment.
""An investment is an asset or item that is purchased with the hope that it will generate income or appreciate in value at some point in the future.""

it's kinda silly to say he didn't make an investment when he's made a profit off of the coin regardless. Getting ""lucky"" could be part of it, sure, but luck didn't put $500 into an alt coin and watch it grow /u/xpinchx did. Honestly this comment just seems like general envy.

Beautifully said and great strategy
I feel that you have to keep in mind that many cryptocurrencies serve no actual purpose and a handful of them can provide most solutions to the problems currently at hand.

For example, Bitcoin was introduced as a universal decentralized currency that would be borderless and thus not be controlled by certain governments or be subject to certain costs. Now the Bitcoin usecase has since switched to being a store of value and others have taken its place being focused on being a currency, but only one of them is actually needed to fulfil that role. Having multiple cryptocurrencies would defeat the purpose of the idea in the first place, as we'd still be working with different currencies that aren't interoperable.
I understand your point however that ‚Äúmass adoption‚Äù will only last till this bull cycle then people will take their money somewhere else. However behind the scenes I‚Äôm seeing a mass crypto adoption where for the first time in modern history central banks are scared. That‚Äôs a sign of mass adoption not a celebrity ceo pumping a meme coin
That's not correct. It won't come to a point where everyone wants their money back. Today it's an investment but tomorrow it's a part of life. Right now it's on the rise looking for a stable floor once it's stable it's built perfectly to be a world wide currency. It becomes a worldwide coin for all to use nomatter what your buying or selling and where your selling  it from or 2. No exchange rates no figuring out just equally accepted trade medium.

Yeah basically right ü§£. With Ethereum 2.0, even $4000 isn't a stupid decision to buy.
Doge itself ain‚Äôt even over for sure. DOGET also looks promising. Idk about safemoon, mixed feelings.
Can‚Äôt argue with you there !!
I haven‚Äôt seen a crypto lose enough value to turn $1000 into nothing, but I have seen cryptos that have turned 1K into 100K when they‚Äôre not even looking.
Um r/dogecoindev would like a word with you
Well, I‚Äôd say there are two kinds of investors. Those without much money to lose, and those who will barely notice if a few hundred or thousand go up in smoke. The difference between them is a matter of degrees, and in both cases they should not put any money into crypto than they can afford to lose. Even poker players who make their living off cards don‚Äôt put more money into the pot than they can afford to lose.
Ah, damn. Was otherwise a fun video.
People will lose so much money because of few manipulative and delusional idiots.
Well then that‚Äôs their fault. If they dive in headlong without doing their due diligence of what they are getting into, they only have themselves to blame. It‚Äôs a personal choice in the end, nothing more. Just as with anything else we spend money on.
Especially with how fast the value is gonna come off Doge when *the dump* happens this time.
Exactly why I don't get why people go all ""I don't want you to lose your money!"", whenever a memecoin is brought up. When I'm perfectly comfy with the idea lol
He‚Äôs saying that will bounce back if you hold. It might not but there is a good chance it does.
> it was devastating

I guess he did
I never said the potatoes were sad I said the field was. Your field might be amazing, lucky you. Doesn‚Äôt make their lives any better. Have some compassion.
A growing market but it's still zero sum for the participants, it's not like growing food where value is being created that previously didn't exist.
Only if you start comparing against others. Give me 200x in 5 years any day. That's better than what the banks are giving me at 1.5% per year for fix deposit.
Yeah I need to buy more.  Who knows what they‚Äôll do, but they‚Äôre definitely a fake fly by night coin.
Edited: oops meant they are the real deal!
Yea, investment was the wrong word.  It essentially is gambling.
I'm not your bud. And I was referring to a single meme coin, Doge. Thats a gamble not a strategy.
Are you trying to make me cry? If so you did it :(

But we have banano
Thanks!
I put $50 in doge out of curiosity, then started reading about it after. If I lose my $50 no biggy, but I know people who put hundreds in after hearing about this kid at work. Some of these people I know for a fact can‚Äôt afford it.

I do agree that it is still a meme but I don't think that that is all it is. And yeah the whole Robinhood situation sucks but there is hope that they will release a wallet.
About to be #3 coin it's a *great* meme
Ok can you give me an example then

Really thanks please die
I‚Äôm sure ur referring to like rsi or maybe a fear and greed index. It was a joke tho lol.
I'm not ur mom
oh... So... Say someone bought $1,000 DOGE at .72 wouldn't the value of DOGE would need to drop to .071-ish for that to happen?

>**you don't hear about the hundreds**

because they haven't happened. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
LOL
DOGE would have to drop remarkably low for someone to lose their shirt like the ""hundreds of stories"" no one has heard of because they don't exist. 

I think DOGE is still very much a safe haven under 1$. SuriusCoins, those are the danger. There's so many of them with lofty mission statements, confusing tech explanations and flashy graphic design departments that mean absolutely nothing. 

I would bet those are the ones you're going to hear the stories about. Especially with DOGE not being able to even top 1$
 LABS sounds like a suriuscoin with a flashy web page and a lofty mission statement.

fwiw I get the over all message to tamper down expectations. But piling on DOGE is just obviously bitter. 

DOGE and memecoins are not what is going to make the **big crash** happen with Cryptocurrency.(And it will happen) It's these shitcoins with their guys in business casual sportsjackets explaining some bullshit mission statement on a flashy website. They are why DOGE exists in the first place.

If anything DOGE is just going to serve as a warning to all of Cryptocurrency. But it's a far safer bet than 70% of these suriuscoins.
Coinbase let me stake it. If you go to the r/ETH subreddit you‚Äôll see tons of questions about how to do so.
They go up because more people keep buying ‚Äúlottery tickets‚Äù in hopes of hitting. Same concept different flavor of juice
I see your point, and raise you this ü•î
I was counting on that penny to hold me up until retirement.  SMH...

I worked in finance, but not for 10 years or so. I couldn't imagine trying to trade cryptocurrency.  I traded complex derivative products that no one could really understand except maybe the big investment banks. Then the 2008 crash happened and Bernie Madoff was exposed.   Cryptocurrency is very high risk, but to each their own...
I took on commodities and lost through ignorance. I‚Äôm doing the Rocky Balboa now in terms of educating myself.
Someone hates - hater !!
Yeah it's the riskiest. You might as well be guessing colors at the roulette table.
Wouldn't the position close far sooner than 10 cents? Who in their right mind leverages then rides out the dive. That's the exact opposite of the purpose of leverage. Some un educated outt here dam
I worked in a Casino before covid-19 play money for some people is what I make in a year. Some people show up with 20k minimum
Ive kept 20$ into shib thinking its not mine, lets see how it goes lol
Same. My 5 turned into a whopping 35. Only thing I invested in that moved up and I put hardly anything into it.
Ya I put in 100$ and got 1200 shares at .05 cent each.
Still got em lol
This is the key a reasonable sum. Don‚Äôt put what you don‚Äôt have.
Similar story. I did the same. But when doge went up to like .08 of a penny I sold off for like 25 bucks or some shit.. then it went up to 60 cents and I was like FUUUCK. Lol
That's why the rich are richer and the poor are poorer.
I‚Äôve invested $500 since January. I just want it to grow back to damn near 3k and cash out 2k
That's what I did with that Shib, put in $20, and if it were ever to reach $ I'd be a millionaire lol
I was day trading dogecoin in 2018 and had $1300 in‚Ä¶ F to me
This is the correct way to invest.
I am NOT rich and I originally put $4,952 in on Dogecoin at 2 cents. I was told to buy in by a family member on Christmas just two weeks before when it cost less than a penny but I unfortunately failed to listen at that time and instead bought in at the 2 cent mark. I currently have $30k down on SHIB but that $30k was only made into $30k last week. It was just $10k bought in at .00002800 before that. I just do my research. These meme coins aren't just dumb meme coins like people with Bitcoin for example, tend to see. They just see the price and maybe the number of coins available and automatically skip the research where as I am willing to go all in at times on memecoin and each time, I have banked significantly by being willing to do so because I do my research just like you would with any other crypto. You could probably get in on this idea right now, with SHIB and potentially come out very successful soon since there is like 40 billion dollars in support behind this coin right now and it's price predictions are already predicting another decimal point is shaven off the coin here probably within a week or two. I personally think it will reach a penny as well with the burn rate being a thing in play. Maybe not get rich and maybe not today but I think it's coming.
Yep real talk
Lol
I always go with the Rockefeller quote of ""the way to make money is to buy when blood is running in the streets."" I buy things when they crash like most companies during covid or Bitcoin around what it's doing now. If I think a company will survive and long-term do better I just keep my money on the side and buy in when it's a fraction of the value so I can hold until it recovers or goes higher over a few years out.
2300 dollars, not stocks
I did. Elon‚Äôs tweets were there and he has a huge fan base. Signs were def there
[removed]
Very crypto
I‚Äôve heard so many ‚Äúfriend of friend‚Äù stories about Dogecoin millionaires lately that I think a lot of them are just veiled pump attempts at this point. Congrats to those who were lucky enough to buy Dogecoin before the hype and not sell it until the highs, but in reality the number of people throwing tens of thousands into meme coins on a whim after they‚Äôve been dead for years but juuuust before a sudden spike is not a high number.

Also remember where the money comes from when someone buys low and sells at the peak: It‚Äôs not coming out of thin air, it‚Äôs coming from new buyers hoping to get rich, and it‚Äôs going into the pockets of old buyers cashing out at their expense before the crash.
Yah I'm a big investor in doge but if he only put in $2300 and it was only a few months ago... it hasnt been under a cent in a long like so say he bought at 4 cents he wouldnt even have 60,000 if it hit a dollar which it didnt
Sure. I was just saying LTC has the better use case even though it didn't turn out to give a better return. Anyway I though LTC had seen a large rise in price recently.
Oh I like crypto for sure. But I put in 400 six months ago and the highest it ever got was 6-8 thousand so without leverage just impossible. But definitely possible with leverage just more risky.
My bad man! Entirely missed that comment was from 5 months ago. That changes things entirely! I now entirety believe you! Haha. I don't even know your friend and I am definitely jealous too! Lol. Thanks for the response!
i turned my 30 with 20 into 150 so far

I haven't even touched that money but now it's plummeting for sure
I turned $30 of free coinbase all the way up to $534. Now I‚Äôm at 220 sad
Ah Coinbase makes sense‚Ä¶one of these days they will charge more than the money you transacting with
Wait till you find out you have to pay $30 to file that $3.28 in your taxes
This is close to what i did, i still havent put anything into it yet, i got a free 5 dollar stock,instantly sold it and dumped into doge and 1 stock, this was a year ago,  fast forward to now and all ive done was sit on it and everytime my stock gave me a dividend i dumped it back into doge, acct started at 5 bucks and now its at around 1500, i still have 1 stock and 1980 doge.

My free stock from webull, SNAP, is one of my best performing positions.  1 share up 350% in a year. Lol

I‚Äôm aware lol I just set up an investment plan to DCA for ETH and I literally turned $20 into $21
I post mainly to help who I can.
All I did was rely on my parents to front me a few million in the highest education standards, seed money, free room and board and use their billion dollar contacts to build my empire!!
So... you‚Äôre telling me my plan to quit my job, get up at 5am, fast, meditate, ‚Äúgrind‚Äù for ten hours, read 7 books, WONT work?
Defining successful realistically helps too. For all anyone knows every one of them is completely miserable lol.
The rise and grind culture are those people. They believe through sheer grinding they will succeed and become rich. That's not how it works. You need to a viable product and a good business plan backed up serious investors to make your dream into a reality. Even that can fail and that does not mean you were weak or had a bad plan. It just failed because the market moved on to something. To become wealthy is incredibility difficult and for most people it is out of their reach no matter how hard you try. There is only so many rich people the economy can sustain.
Elon tweeted something today that encompasses what you're saying.  Like, stfu dude, you had emerald money to fall back on.
I fully agree, I‚Äôm 32 and have been through every single avenue of finance. If I were ‚Äúthe successful person preaching‚Äù I think I would just say ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a couple of things I did - if they don‚Äôt work for you try literally everything and everyone‚Äôs ideas and all of your own to leave no stone unturned no matter how many times you fail‚Äù and EVENTUALLY you‚Äôll figure something out. People need to figure things out themselves. No ones ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how to be successful video‚Äù ever worked for anyone in my opinion. They just kinda point people in a positive direction - the rest is up to them.
All the successful people had rich parents, poor people make it but they are less likely to succeed.
Right?  And they‚Äôre probably preaching thru an institution or platform that has filtered them to the top to be able to express these views.  Double layers of privilege.
No people throwing away there lives is worse than arrogance
Focus. Meditate. Push through. Find your inner lion.
But I love his ""when I was a boy in Bulgaria"" stories. They make for quality meme content.
Yeah he may have been born in Bulgaria but he was able to start Robinhood in the US and made it successful there. Would have been harder/impossible to do that in Bulgaria.
This. The US is nothing honestly compared to Europe and Mexico when it comes to nepotism and using your family connections to get ahead. There they pretty much always go into the family business. Even if it‚Äôs a giant company the founder typically will pass it on to their child. All of those rich people were born rich or did shady deals with the government to gain traction
Even Michael Dell‚Äôs parents lent him 600k at some point during the early of Dell when he needed liquidity
I love this fact. It's amazingly simple but so obvious how it was missed for so long. Probably one of my most favourite. It makes everyone go ""huh... Of course.""

It's the same for f1 cars and general car safety. We eventually realised that making the car disintegrate(crumple zones) was better than making the car as solid as possible.
I love this story. I am an engineer and am always looking for this type of ""learn to think differently and avoid traps"" examples for educational purposes. This one is going into my standard lecture.
This is pretty interesting
I originally heard that as a Car Talk puzzler on the radio.

Yes, I'm old.
[Thanks to Abraham Wald.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias#In_the_military) One of my favorite statistician stories.
It‚Äôs interesting and also kind of terrifying that no one thought of that angle. It‚Äôs seems obvious now in hindsight.
Wow, that's a great way to explain it
I I immediately thought of this
I can't find the source (had thought it was Pratchett), but I like this:

- There have been many documented cases where dolphins have guided a lost swimmer back to sure, but then you never hear about the people they lead further out to sea.
I believe it was the same with WWI helmets. Nearly got rid of them due to the increased  amount of soldiers with head injuries. Before someone pointed out the other option!
there is also an example with dolphins, we often hear how many where saved by them but we don't get to hear how many people where actually drown by dolphins
Thanks for the great example üòä
I tell this to each new incoming grad student.  All scientists should have this at the front of their brain to immediately recognize and screen out survivorship bias.
Wow that's a really interesting fact
There really is a relevant XKCD for everything.
I think that also makes it harder to see the effects of drinking and/or drugs. For every old person who's chonging cigs, there are many out there who have departed or are severely disabled, but you don't regularly see those people, only the functional ones, and it presents a misleading impression that you too can easily make it to a ripe old age that way.
That's actually the sub I was thinking of when writing my comment. 

If there's a post about losing everything, home, family, and the person is desperate and it's sad, no one's gonna do shit.
Every dollar that is made has a dollar that is lost. There is activity around it (shorts and what not) but all of those are also zero sum (think Vegas betting) there are no losers who don‚Äôt get counted. They might be IGNORED by some people but that is not survivorship bias. It‚Äôs just focusing on a certain aspect of something.

The plane example is prime. They didn‚Äôt fix the other things because they COULDN‚ÄôT know them. There were also flaws in the planes that came back that they missed for whatever reason that are still being fixed to this day. See the difference?
That is a cautionary tale.

I was pretty careless with my investments during the end of 2018, putting stuff into beyond red line risky investments with some genuinely good white papers, but no evidence they were achievable. I've done really well in 2, but the rest were trash or ended up being scams, with no-one to blame but myself for getting caught up in it.

I had the stark realisation today that if I had done nothing and just held the BTC and ETH that I had initially bought, I would be about 30-40% better off than I am now. The way I did it made me love crypto a lot more, though.
Wow thanks for sharing man. This really helped give me a lot of perspective
As my biz professor said 20 years ago‚Ä¶ you can cut out the middleman, but you can‚Äôt cut out their function. 

Retailers exists for a reason.
I wonder if you put $1 in each coin on Binance. what are the chances you'll have a fortune in 3 years? anyone tried and now filthy rich?
Suppliers are fairly far between though and Amazon had already offered warehouse pickup.  The cut out the middleman thing was cool.  I use it when I go back to where my parents live just for nostalgia. 

But going to the mushroom farm for mushrooms, then another farm for fresh meat and possibly dairy. Then a brewery for beer. Etc etc it adds up
The.... entire... supply chain market? And you thought this would work ‚Äúat scale‚Äù?
It's weird how so many cryptos sprung up that were like 'we're gonna be the transaction method for x industry.' when plenty of established cryptos could already fill those roles.
Nothing wrong with this. You saw a product that could've been good and gave it a shot. Most successful products are the result of hundreds of iterations and if no one believed in them from the start the whole line would have ceased there. Maybe down the road one of those developers will change the world.
Sooo...Costco?
>but directly from suppliers with the implementation of warehouses where people could personally pick up the orders

Costco? Lul.

Most of the goods in Costco are on consignment, Costco doesn't even ""own the goods"" and can return anything that doesn't sell.

Realize that supermarkets (selling food) are already stupidly low margin businesses, like we are talking margins of 1%.
You see and this is why most of my money is in real estate or stocks. FUCK THAT NOISE.
Insolar was a Russian scam / rug pull. Very surprised you lost money yet still believe their story

So the one with both, safemoon, is destined to fail more spectacularly?
Even legit coins. STK was building a payment network using ETH and state channels, with partnerships with actual Canadian banks.

Never underestimate the stupidity and greed of millions of people with a poor understanding of the space. 
As sad as it is, I think these memecoins will probably stick around for a while. A whole lot more than 3 months at least.

This reminds me of the viral conversation on a Glaswegian Facebook account.

Someone had arranged to go and buy a golf club from someone else in Glasgow. The person selling the golf club then messaged the prospective buyer something that was clearly meant for someone else.

The gist was that an idiot was coming round to buy a golf club, and he suggested they smash them round the head with the golf club, and keep both the money and the golf club.

The cherry on the cake was him going ‚Äúoh no, don‚Äôt worry, that was meant for someone else‚Äù. Reassuring
Non American here, why not? Will people treat you differently if they know how much or little money you made on something?
Perhaps that's just an American thing. Here in Germany, it is quite common to talk about finances and salaries if that's the topic.

I‚Äôve been in a similar situation. Co worker kept talking to me about crypto back in 2017 I put in 6k right before the bubble burst and was middling around $900 for years until recently I‚Äôm finally in the green by a good bit, and thinking about cashing out for now.
That's me. I started buying in December 2017 then market crashed. I bought few times in the middle but it kept going low so I stopped paying attention. Now I wish I had kept buying. I want to buy now but it feels like it's too late for this cycle.
If the best people in investing can't time the market then what hope do you have?
Even easier if you start with 10 million
Also easier if you start with

I've currently put ¬£220 into crypto. If I can get that investment to ¬£2200 then I'll start taking it more seriously as a method of paying for my life. Currently at about ¬£400 and absolutely LOVING the variety of emotions this crypto thing dishes up.
Where exactly are people toting these huge gains to? Asking for a friend.
I‚Äôm almost there..
It definitely was!
Why would someone want to talk to someone who brags about how much money they have, just in general? Same goes for crypto.

That sounds like a horrific time.
I'm pretty far down the low income ladder, but from mining and appreciation now have a 400$ portfolio! Im pretty proud of it honestly. And even if the whole thing tanks, I'll gladly buy the dip for the same reason anyone else in the know would. I just want to not be poor lol.

Day trading BTC on mtgox at 1.07... I had thousands. Sold when it peaked at 7, for a very healthy profit.

It's best not to think about it.
Unless you‚Äôre like my friend who recently figured   out he had Bitcoin from playing online poker years ago... He found out there was 60 he has and had no idea....
I mean you don't have to sell every single one of your coins lol.Even if you started with let's say 100 btc, and you remained with 2-3 then you still have a shit ton of money to cash out now.
Someone told me sometime ago to never second guess profits.
It‚Äôs free money.
I bought in 2011. Made like 60x on my money and sold it all at under $200 per BTC. Couldn‚Äôt believe how fortunate I was. 

You would have to hold a *really* long time through some really crazy swings. Unless you were already rich, continuing to hold it all as the value went into the millions would be complete insanity.
Never feel bad about bagging a profit.  There will be plenty of other missed opportunity in life.
My friends mined like 30 freshmen year of college. Sold it at like $200 and took us on a nice spring break trip. They have a good sense of humor about it now surprisingly. They say it‚Äôs all just luck and not everyone can have it.
When you cashed it out, it ended up being worth a million dollars in real life value based on what it did for you at the time

The only one I'm invested in is [MindMed](https://mindmed.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MindMed-Corporate-Presentation-4.27.2021.pdf).  There are others out there, too.  Compass Pathways has been the most popular.  Most shroomstocks aren't viable, in my opinion.
I have yet to pick a green energy company.  That's the one category I have yet to pull the trigger on.  I'm thinking about [QuantumScape](https://s26.q4cdn.com/263384136/files/doc_downloads/2021/QS-Landscape-2021-v032221-v1.pdf).
If you aren't sure on a particular stock and want some general clean energy exposure, there are a few good ETFs in the sector. TAN is a mix of solar stocks, FAN is a mix of wind energy stocks, and ICLN or PBW are more general clean energy.

For individual stocks, Enphase and solaredge are good solar picks, Albemarle has a ton of lithium mines, but I'm not familiar with any geothermal or hydropower companies. Though pretty much all those stocks are included in PBW and ICLN I believe, and are relatively large for green energy companies (maybe less potential growth).
TAN is a great ETF for green energy
Where to start with skills development and credential acquisition?  This really depends on your own situation (e.g. current interests, financial position, etc.)  I started off at a two year college before transferring to a four year college.  I commuted to campus via public transit the entire time and continued living at home to save money.  I also worked multiple part-time jobs while in school.  I still have massive student loans, though.  

As far as starting off with investing, definitely do your own research.  Cannabis is my biggest investment.  I recommend reading financial statements and investing according to your own analysis as it relates to your own investment thesis.  An objective analysis of financial statements will likely lead you to American multi-state operators (i.e. MSOs), but there is a vocal cohort of investors with money invested in Canadian firms who think MSOs are a bad investment.  You should look into companies yourself and make your own opinion.

Mental healthcare has been awful forever.  Things aren't as bad now as they were a century ago, but they're still pretty bad.  Mental healthcare is probably about 100 to 150 years ""behind"" other fields of medicine.  To make comparisons with surgery:  During the Civil War, surgery almost always meant amputation.  A century ago, surgeons had just barely learned how to slow bleeding during surgery and were finally on board with the whole handwashing thing.  In mental healthcare today, we're basically at the same stage surgery was at in the 1910s.  Psychedelic pharmaceuticals will revolutionize the field of mental healthcare.  Psychedelic assisted cognitive behavioral therapy and casual micro-dosing will both be commonplace a decade from now. 

Electric vehicle manufacturers will likely outsource their batteries.  Who will manufacture those batteries?  Residential solar will also be adopted as the price of solar panels decreases.  Those panels will also require batteries.  Who will manufacture those panels and batteries?  Who will service them?  This is a tricky industry.

As far as crypto goes, Ethereum seems to have the most utility.  I've ignored crypto from 2009 up until this year.  I used to write it off as something only hobbyists, speculators, and criminals could use.  I still think speculation more so than utility is driving Bitcoin's price, but Ethereum seems to have serious potential.  It could rival Amazon Web Services for certain applications.  I suspect companies like Amazon will eventually become major Ethereum stakers, if they haven't already.  Hedge funds are likely already leasing warehouses and buying up hardware and ETH ahead of the launch of PoS.  With energy related costs around 99.95% lower than PoW, a major barrier to entry and fixed cost has been eliminated.  

Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin in use.  What will happen to price, I have no idea.  With crypto, price isn't necessarily tied to utility, so it's hard to say given the speculative nature even of useful coins.

That depends on a lot of variables, like location and lifestyles. With some smart investments and openness to risk and short term volatility, 10% annual growth including dividends (or staking rewards: crypto dividends) is very reasonable. With 500k, 10% is 50k. Living here in the midwest U.S. 50k a year is extravagant. I make about 37k with more than enough disposable income. At 50k, I could bump up my lifestyle and still have some decent money to re-invest.

This is my short form argument for why 500k is my early retirement goal.
> Sad thing is you can‚Äôt even retire on 1 million anymore.

that heavily depends on your location/country and your expectations.

i could easily retire on $500.000

if you are willing to move to a LCOL area and live a frugal lifestyle 1mio is more than enough... if you work some low key job 1mio is enough in most other areas as well.

You can easily retire on one million, it just won't be retiring to yachts spending freely, it'll be retiring to a safe 40k a year income.
Brother, I'm in my late 20's and could retire on 1 million right now and never hurt for anything I needed ever again.
how is that sad? You are just saying arbitrary numbers with no context.
It's a goal.
A good rule of thumb is the 4% safe withdrawal rule. So take however much money you can live on yearly and multiply it by 25 to get how much you need in retirement. 3.5MM is $140k/year.
I don't get it couldn't you invest a million dollars and live off he interest or am I way off base?
That depends. At current prices and rates you put $1MM into a stock like MO that will give you a dividend of $69k (nice) a year. It should continue to get higher over time as well.

Is it super comfortable and will it keep up with inflation for may years? Eh sort of hard to say... but you could probably retire on it if you don't mind a basic lifestyle. Especially if you decide to go live somewhere cheap.

Personally I would want like $3m to be comfortable retiring, but if you are already older and frugal then you could swing $1m.

Also honestly if you are younger you will get bored if you retire most likely and end up working on other things that could bring in some income just due to boredom.
Ya, right, remember that post from that South African who asked for possibilities to get some ways to earn free coins, cuz even a few coins would change his life?

Not everyone is living in Switzerland.

But you're right in what you say. People should doublecheck before retiring or quitting jobs.
if you have a pension and health insurance plus 1mm, you can buy a 4plex, generate further income, and still have over 500k to do whatever with. but you always hear 1mm generates 60k/year just in a savings account. is that accurate? cause you can live on that.
at my current cost of living in my mid 30ies, i could retire with $450k without accounting for interested.

but then again, if i had higher income i‚Äôd probably end up with a higher cost of living... my point is; you don‚Äôt need millions to live good, just minimize overpriced/stupid expenses; which is hell of a lot easier once you are economically independent and not location locked due to retirement.
Can confirm.
But your shitposts will taste different when you're rich
If you manage to lose your job and become quite poor, you'd also have a lot of free time to shitpost.

No suggestion, just saying...
Maybe your real goal is the friends you made along the way and the scammers, don't you dare forget the scammers.
Moon farming can be a new profession :)
Damn it they‚Äôve seen through my thin veil
You know what‚Äôs better than having proper wealth? Proper wealth + 1.
Yes. Then start a post about how moons are helping me feed my family. 

I like your thinking.
I would probably just give random gold to people for terrible comments. What else am I going to do while I'm waiting for my Lambo to finish gassing up?
Elon Musk would not agree
fine i won‚Äôt send you 10 btc
I think you can always change life and that money is just strong tool but lifestyles are rich and diverse.
Can always use more drugs
We are in a bull run after all.

Things would change when it all goes tits up
i put in 300$ cad in feb.  Now worth 1900$ usd.  Just casually doubling my money every month üêí
That‚Äôs awesome! My brother got most of his Doge at $.06 and didn‚Äôt tell me about it till it hit about .30 so that‚Äôs when I bought. He‚Äôs doing real well, has a few grand in there, we‚Äôve just been discussing when we should pull. Excited for tonight!
That's pretty good man. That's kinda where I'm at too with eth.
yep exactly. they call this FOMO (Fear Of Mising Out) and i already got taste of that. i bought bitcoin cash for 50 euros at 600E, sold it at 800, and then it went to 1370 in like a week. could have doubled my money. still i think the most important for us is to take our initial investments out and possibly and possibly put some profits on a side so that we can invest when it crashes... easier said then done, i know xD
What about EIP-1559, would it be a good time to sell since it is supposed to tank miner's profits?
Sad things always the funniest in life
Reading old posts from the last crash is depressive af.
When my friends ask the best time to buy I always tell them to look for when the suicide hotline is on the front page of Reddit.
I stopped following this sub back then as it was to depressing as fuck... plus I only put $400 in so I wasn't in too deep, but some people were putting thousands into shit coins... remember one dude expecting a devoice as he put 40K in Time New Bank Coin at it's peak
Was that an actual thing or a meme?
Yikes. I remember seeing something like that before on some of these financial subs.
It‚Äôs always upsetting to see those posts.  However that is my buy indicator.  I also use RSI.
I've always thought about this too. Like, what if the entire internet experience of 2010, or whenever, could be recreated. Functioning links, breaking news stories, etc. You could relive your discovery of 4chan... or maybe not. Could be a cool video game mechanic anyway
I've been thinking about this for a while, is there one?
You kind of can. It‚Äôs called social media analytics and it‚Äôs prohibitively expensive. Brands use it to see what consumers think about them.

Hi Coke. Hi Pepsi üëã
You can use Google to accomplish this.

Google ""site:reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency"" (no quotes when you type this)

Click on Tools

Click on dropdown box that says ""Any Time"". Click on ""Custom""

Select the Calendar years or months you're interested in, ex. Jan 1 2017 to Dec 31 2017

Voila. Archived posts solely from the time you explicitly want to see.
well now, there *is* slight difference between reading and living through it
Do you mean like the remindme bot?
Reddit unfortunately doesn't allow for time-specific searches, but https://redditsearch.io exists. It's a bit wonky but it gets the job done

Found this [beauty](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7mtoow/ripple_at_second_place_by_market_cap_surpassed)
Try wayback machine, Jan 9th 2018 for example [here] (https://web.archive.org/web/20180109030118/https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/)

I find wayback machine's UI pretty clunky so I like to instead just edit the url to a specific date. Ex. above url has 20180109030118 (YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS), assuming its a url with regular snapshots like this one is, since there are snapshots almost every day in this case. You should be able to just input the YYYYMMDD part and it will automatically fill the hours minutes seconds part with the first one available from that day. Also if you click a url in the wayback machine it wont redirect properly, when it opens just delete everything before the 'https://www.reddit...' part and it will open the actual reddit page
bro i was about to say withdraw that shit and retire for life homie lol
Oh sorry didn't even say the coins lol. No I put 400 into doge, $200 is my profit from that and my 300 in bitcoin.
I guess I'm the only one who assumed he meant BTC  at 52. as in 52 thousand. ha.
I'd hold out just a liiiiiitle bit longer
Congrats! I think you made the right call. Doge really doesn't have a future once the hype dies down and Elon forgets about it.
That's great, I was talking about those who shame those who sell and take profits. Nothing wrong with either, though hodling is much better. Time in the market is better than timing the market, but you have to take your money eventually.
No offense, but even just the part of my portfolio in Bitcoin is up 6x since last year so that‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ not that great.
Well.. this will truly be a test for: buy the rumor, sell the news

Meme investments can be very fast & hold long

I'd suspect Dogecoin can go higher... but at 2-3 months in the range of 50% peak like $GME. Maybe 0.3-0.5 USD

Winners are those who bought Q1 2021 before... could be wrong but who knows
Lol yeah but im still up by a decent amount. I only ever put in money I was willing to 100% lose
[deleted]
With your comment alone, I worry for a lot of Doge holders
[removed]
Thanks man.  Sitting out there right now with them and they are loving it.  Thank you for your kind message.
Thank you so much!! 

[Here's one of them having fun outside](http://imgur.com/gallery/qwXnQS1)
They're still putting their money that they earned at risk to pay for that lottery ticket. That's not lazy. It's naive, but not lazy.
Mostly following all subreddits very closely, keeping an eye on the hype and checking the value very often. I realized early from the spike from 0.05 to 0.12 that things were beginning to happen. I bought at 0.12 and at that point I was ready to sell if if dipped below 0.08. Instead it rose to 0.36 in less than 48h and it signified hype was still taking control. It dipped to 0.25 but I held since I realized the dip affected the whole market. Then it rose to 0.6.

I'm still holding. Knowing that sub and the trend, it's going to hit at least $1 but I'll sell instantly if it dips below 0.5.

It was easy money, really. Took some gamble but it wasn't hard to predict it was going to rise once the market started rising.
Yet I'm $20k+ richer than you in less than two weeks.
Oh shit. Where did I send the pictures of my portfolio?!!!
which wallet do you use ?
I was told i was too late when gme fell to 54 and then the week after it rose to 200
Yes it‚Äôs unfortunate. But these people have been mislead thinking DOGE is some get rich quick thing, hint: it‚Äôs not
[deleted]
I guess they're the kind of people that are the most desperate to win big. Well better go draw out my $10 now!
*gamble
Or you are just desesperate, and some people are and would do anything to recover some previous losses.
I haven‚Äôt touched doge at all. I‚Äôm speaking to all the new crypto people coming in spending money they can‚Äôt afford to lose thinking they will get rich quick
It‚Äôs quite common, still. If you‚Äôre a working class person who can barely squirrel away money for rent and groceries, and you‚Äôre watching a huge bull market with asset bubbles everywhere where random people on the internet get 10x or 100x their investment back on speculative plays... it waters the mouth a bit to dream of a life where you can do that too.

Think about the last year. 20 million people lost their jobs in the US alone, millions of people lost their loved ones, and yet assets are booming like there is no tomorrow. You have an insane combination of countless people who have been pushed to the brink and are down to their last dollar, while financial markets party it up. Even people who understand the smart thing is to keep an emergency fund in cash, and put their savings in stable ETFs, are also going to see this as a once in a lifetime chance to escape their economic situation.

Many, many people will get burnt. Many have already been burnt making dumb options plays. But I think you need to think about the context before you judge them as just stupid.
True. And the problem I have is so many people encouraging and convincing people to be an idiot. They'll say ""Don't invest more than you can lose"" in one breath, and then promise a kid whose dad has cancer ""Just hold and you'll be on the moon, buddy!""

As someone that really respects personal finance, it's not just dumb. It's reprehensible.
If your last money is $30, you‚Äôre fucked anyway
To a degree yes. But the people going into learn about the coins in those subreddits dedicated to the hype meme shit coins. They essentially get brainwashed into thinking it‚Äôs a guaranteed get rich quick scheme with no downside, compared to walking into 7/11 to buy a scratch off.
That was this sub in 2018. Suicide prevention hotline stickied at the top and everything
I mean, that one guy bought 15k of GMED when he actually wanted to buy GME and last I saw he was up 15% if he kept it...which is better than what GME did.
So what's going on?
Titcoin.   It will be titcoin.
the entirety of crypto speculation is people taking medicore deals, hoping someone else will take a worse deal sometime in the future
Someone that's likely having a bad time.
Never said it's bad.
How does it happen? Do they lose their keys? Does the value drop 99.999%? Is there some weird crypto options?

I can see like 50% or 80% loss or something
Fire departments?
Yeah I was tempted to put a 100 in the other week whne it was around 30p. Would‚Äôve been a good idea but some things come first, like not dropping every penny into crypto.
Dang this hits home. I HODLd thru the crash and 4x my capital and out currently. Could‚Äôve made that 8xd but who knows? We‚Äôre you into non BTC or ethereum coins?
Well there's actual people invested into SafeMoon because it has the word 'safe' in it, I wouldn't be surprised to have people thinking a SL literally means you can't lose more than that number.

People for some reason forget that in order for someone to be able to sell something, there has to be a buyer.
which is why it is important to pull out your cost bases during a stable period and play with house money.
Isn‚Äôt that the opposite of a bubble? Like when everyone is HODLing and staking, doesn‚Äôt that make it less volatile?
Shitcoins are like playing the lottery. Made a 1000% gain in SHIB in 24 hours.
I thought he meant something other than doge
lol which shitcoin is this?
The beginning of February
Yeah buddy! We‚Äôre going streaking in the quad!

It's like a job except that you can't lose money at a job. And 99% of ""day traders"" lose money over time or at the very least make far less than minimum wage. Particularly when you compare to the performance of people who are just letting their money sit in the market in an index fund.
As someone who spent $100 on doge at $0.04 that I‚Äôm ready to lose, would you mind explaining what you mean so some of us can be better educated? Kind of just did it because of the memes and don‚Äôt feel super confident about long term holding. Very new to investing and especially crypto so it would be greatly appreciated. If you don‚Äôt feel like taking the time I totally understand.
I downvoted you so hard.
How is it bad for other cryptos? Personally I avoid any crypto that isn't decentralized‚Äî which was the entire point of crypto initially.
Most coins are traded against btc or eth and fiat. When doge crashes, may cause a small effect but I doubt it. Algorithms run the show and none of them care what doge does.
Gotchya.  I'm just learning about all of these alt coins now, so a bunch of the small and new ones are beyond my radar at the moment.  Makes sense that people would be trying to replicate doge's memery though.
Whats BSC?
Cummies, Titscoin‚Ä¶
I don't know about that. I'd rather go all in on GME than on DOGE. There will be another 40-60% drop somewhere in the near future, and you're gonna get REKT. 

If there is an asset to go all-in it's not DOGE, it's Bitcoin!
I was flipping through all and saw a pretty active sub for some new meme coin, and their whole gimmick is that theres a 10% tax on every transaction that‚Äôs paid out to existing holders. Literally the definition of a pyramid scheme: new money comes in to provide profits for existing participants.
As is the wsb way.
Isn't 80% of it owned by three whales?   So 1929, much pump.
I like the stock. Sounds like you got a bad case of FOMO.
You don't understand pyramid schemes or cryptocurrency if you say that 

For real bud read some shit educate yourself. Stop blindly repeating what other people have said
Literally all my friends are joining the crypto hype train now and every single one of them is jumping into dogecoin. I try to tell them to look at its market cap, how many coins are already in existence, and how they can realistically justify another big surge in price for Doge. They don't really have an answer to the question, but it doesn't deter them at all. 

And I'm just sitting here slowly accumulating ETH and BTC seeing much slower gains but still happy with the performance.
On the one hand, it feels funny and good to see how crypto are getting more and more popular, but on the other hand, when i witness that kind of scene... It shocked me. Throwing 100‚Ç¨ at crypto when you're 15, why not, good for them if they can afford it, but what shocked me is that he didn't seem to care. I know times are different and our social backgrounds may be too, but man... I got the impression he was like ""yeah, 100‚Ç¨, whatever"". I hope they won't lose sight of reality. It's not that easy to make money, even if crypto make seem it's possible (and sometimes, it is, but there are more losers than winners).
While it's unlikely, with all the momentum Doge has, I wouldn't say it's impossible. Maybe not any time soon but who really knows.
All of us were thinking the same when it was 0.06, nobody ever thought it could even come close to half a dollar before finishing the year and yet here we are, not saying another X10 may happen because it is ridiculous but it is crypto after all
I bet your coffee was even sweeter after that
I don't feel like starting, not even for your cute dog
I agree. Full of plot holes.
You just looped back to his original question without answering it though.
In 2018 I was a student and I knew nothing about crypto. Honestly, I still don't know much. But I wanted to try, so I bought DOGE because I know how people work. Masses don't care about how technically great the project is, they want a good story. Doge as the one of the oldest coins was a prime candidate. 3 years later one dude on twitter came and staged that story and herd followed. Best invested 30 bucks in my life, for now.
TBH, I'd argue the big boys of major blockchain like BNB and ETH are just as bad. What are they *currently* doing that has a real world use case outside of crypto? DeFi is currently an elaborate ponzi scheme where people leverage one crypto asset to borrow another so they can speculate on what will go up/down tomorrow. Cardano is the first project I've seen that is doing something real with the whole Ethiopia project, and even that isn't much.

One day these projects will have serious, real use cases, but at the moment its mostly promises of the future which is what makes it so difficult to speculate on either ETH or one of the ETH killers, long term.
> But you also have to agree that many, many of those people didn't get unlucky they just don't understand how to read the market factors.

Some people would've just been stupid yes. Far more would've been naive, and that's not the same thing. It's more reasonable to assign ""unlucky"" to the largest set of people, in my estimation.

The wider point of me bringing this up though, is more to try and address the psychology of those using it. It's compelling to think of everyone that lost out as ""stupid"", and the proxy implication of the person saying that is that *they* aren't stupid. They're calling the unlucky people stupid and artificially reinforcing their own impression of their own ability at navigating this space successfully. Why *that's* bad is because this space is inherently incredibly unpredictable, and *anyone* convincing themselves they're super great at predicting it is likely to take even bigger risks than they otherwise would.

> And again, hard disagree on there being no objective method to tell a good from bad project... That's just... What? Makes zero sense

Of course there isn't. Nobody has any clue which projects are going to fly and which aren't, or for how long they might fly before they crash, or fizzle out, or keep going steadily ""forever"".

It may be possible to identify *some* obvious scams at short glance, but outside of that small set, discerning ""will catch on"" and ""won't"" from the rest is nigh-on impossible. Note I'm using the word ""will"", not ""should"".
Thanks! And true, the paperhanders panicked, sold at a loss then cried when GME surged again from $50 to $170. I honestly don't have most of my portfolio in GME (or a whole lot for that matter) but I have a good feeling about it.
Haha, I'm also bagholding 6 shares. I think I will hold until the end of the year, cause it's not money I'm afraid of losing. Hopefully the squeeze does happen but if it doesn't, not the end of the world.
This is the gwei.
Exactly. I learned this lesson with GME. Luckily I was still able to turn a profit but still
Check out cardano/ADA. Much more scalable than ethereum... have you tried using ETH to swap a token or something? Transaction costs are $20-150 depending on how congested the network is
That sounds like birds diving into a dinosaur fight, blinking and getting smashed to mince meat.
The simple method is once you double your initial investment, pull out what you initially put in. You've balanced out to zero and now you're playing with ""house"" money.
[deleted]
Xmr doesnt have rewards it's just gone up 100 bucks every month damn near. ADA and others are your reward currencies. I just got lucky on that investment bro.
Props. In retrospect an amazing decision.

I‚Äôm betting it will come back.
If this is anything like stocks, and GME in particular... Yes.

I saw someone spend $30k on GME when it was arou d $450, and then it fell down to $300 and GME isn't the racehorse it once was.

Interestingly you could actually make a case for this in certain situations if you were filthy rich and bored and liked to gamble. There are 292,201,338 Powerball combinations, so you could buy every possible number for $584,402,676. If the Powerball jackpot goes higher, buying every number would essentially be a bet that no on else wins. You could declare losses on every ticket that didn't win and would only get taxed on winnings above $584 mil.
People always move their money when bull markets are ending. It sounds like we agree on mass crypto adoption though, in spite of your salt for doge. My opinion: this mass crypto adoption wouldn‚Äôt be happening without it
I‚Äôm too blasted for this but owning doge on robinhood isn‚Äôt the same as having it in your wallet. Go to an athletics game and give them your robinhood account and see what happens.
Fair enough. I feel both our points were clarified.
[deleted]
Honestly, I don‚Äôt think doge was a bad buy at .7. The market is in the dumps right now but Coinbase is about to adopt doge. Also Elon Is working on making it even more efficient. It should return at some point. I bought doge at .05 and am still holding. I‚Äôm considering buying more myself
I do have compassion for the losers.  Even more so for the people who fall for the hype and lose their hard earned money
Correct.
Very true!
You mean they AREN‚ÄôT one haha?
Yea because tons of people made hundreds of thousands off safemoon. I guess those people got scammed? ü§£
I was looking for a few of my friends the other day who are obsessed with Dog e but definitely don‚Äôt understand it fully lol and I think there are some random wallets that support it. I forget names but I was trying to explain to them what they need to do if they really believe in dog e and wanna push it into legitimacy. They...we‚Äôre not hearing it lol

I was thinking about commodities too
Apparently like 800k people got liquidated. So a lot of people were that dumb. It‚Äôs crazy. The influx of so mannnny shitcoins and the big dreams of huge returns had them making really poor decisions. RIP

11‚Ç¨ here.. still hoping for it to move like doge did - lol
That‚Äôs how I felt throwing $20 into safemoon
Hope you kept it in there :)

Well how is it going so far?
Lol
Hope you left it in Shib :)
My buddy bought 2M Doge in April of 2020 and it cost him like 5K which to him isn‚Äôt the end of the world, but also not exactly play money‚Ä¶ he was legitimately interested in the investment‚Ä¶ then got FUD‚Äôd up a few days later and pulled at a loss of a couple hundred bucks lol. I was telling him in January that I had bought some when he told me that and I did the math when I pulled my 10x earnings or whatever it was and he would have had like 5Mil I think it was had he just let it sit one year. I feel bad for him, but I mean that‚Äôs the game, we all have that ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moment at some point if we do this long enough and we all kick ourselves‚Ä¶ I was trying to invest thousands into BTC when it was a dollar and gave up because I wasn‚Äôt tech savvy and every single person I knew that was in any kinda finance at the time told me how stupid the idea was‚Ä¶ also an ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moment that I kick myself for. But there are literally more opportunities just like it every single day with these things and things like it.
dogecoin isnt a stock lol
No.... He bought at .0003
It moved up to almost 400, which is good, but not astronomical. Then it crashed back down to a little over 100 in the last few days
I turned my $92 into $43.

Feel free to hit me up for any financial advice.
Wait, you guys make money?

Fees are a nail to the coffin of some tokens. There's only few who has some great ones like Vampdoge
Taxes?
Why do you need to pay that much more to file your taxes? Do them yourself.
*knock knock* IRS OPEN UP!!
I‚Äôm pretty sure you don‚Äôt have to claim amounts that small, I wanna say it‚Äôs only on capital gains of 120 or more, I could be wrong, but I make more than that usually so I wouldn‚Äôt know.
[removed]
I‚Äôd love to be audited for $3.28

You think I‚Äôm gonna report that on my return? Lmao
You don‚Äôt have to claim less than $2500
What are these ""taxes"" you speak of?

I put my life savings into doge cause it's the best and most fundementaly sound INFLATIONARY coin...
Never heard of these things called ""taxes""

Sounds made up
ü§£
Where are you doing your taxes man? You're getting ripped the fuck off.
Y‚Äôall do TAXES?!?
You‚Äôd have to pay taxes anyway. And most crypto exchanges offer their forms for tax filing reasons. Don‚Äôt know if your post was intended as a joke or not because I‚Äôve never sold my original positions in crypto. Bought and held. Probably a mistake but also not riding it for the rags to riches story either.
Came here to say this! They do not tell you about the massive shit that little $40 is going to take all over your taxes.
Isnt there a threshold for small economic activities where you dont pay taxes because thry count as hobbies? Like YouTube or streaming and making a few bucks only?.
Lol worst feeling ever
Don‚Äôt have to pay extra $ for taxes if you lose all your money üòé
The IRS doesn‚Äôt charge you to file taxes. What in the hell are you talking about?
Imagine living in a country where you have to tell your tax agency how much you need to pay.
That was a direct hit!
Stop spreading FuD
You don‚Äôt have to report such a small amount on your taxes
You have to pay to file your taxes?!
Here in Belgium you can actually go there and they'll do it for free...
This doesn‚Äôt make sense.  Why would you have to pay more than you made?
Why would you have to pay 30 more dollars than usual?
Haha taxes. Catch me if you can. How they going to know if you own crypto unless you make large enough transactions on exchanges like coinbase that they are forced to report you. Meanwhile it‚Äôs easy to just move everything into exchanges without KYC and never have any transactions the IRS has info on and aren‚Äôt even affiliated with your real name.
You missed the op point.  We need to cry over people who refuse to give him 1000 instead.
I sold the stock, but since it was valued at 4.99 when they gave it to me, that amount can't be withdrawn I guess. Anything beyond that can be.
I use Fidelity for real investing, just fuckin‚Äô around on RH and checking out the slick interface

True, but here's a free trick. Just remember that by 1600s material living standards, everyone is living like kings. If you time traveled back in time and tried to trade an old android phone with a broken screen for a castle, you'd probably get it. Of course, life is worse now in many ways, but you don't actually need half the shit you consume. And the expectations of rich will always just steadily increase. Drop out now and join the vast majority that are rich by 1600s standards.
There‚Äôs actually more rich people now than there has ever been in history. I don‚Äôt know what country you live in but in the US it‚Äôs hard but not incredibly difficult to become wealthy...a billionaire yes that‚Äôs very difficult but a low millionaire is definitely doable
got a source on that?
I left finance to start up. The first venture failed but I had enough left over after the last of the AR came in to start one more and it worked. I only had enough cash for two swings and failing is a phenomenal teacher. People with family money can fail many times and that‚Äôs another huge advantage for the privileged class, probably more so than private education and the inherited network.
Yeah exactly if you need a video to figure it out you are probably not going to figure it out. Also each situation is dependent on the time it happens in. It would be way more difficult to start an Amazon now...you can‚Äôt just do what Jeff did and then you‚Äôre rich
They're really just a meme at this point
Happens in software too. We call them anti-patterns. Concepts that sound like a no brainer and commonly accepted actually does harm.
After combat helmets came back into use around the time of WW1, they must have been confused about the *rise* in patients with head injuries.
Crumple zones sounds like a porno I would regret seeing
i love how you say ""we"" as if you had anything to do with it lol. just bustin ur chops
>Planes returning from battle were covered in bullet holes and the initial plan was to reinforce where the bullet holes were.  When reality those areas were fine and what needed to be armored/reinforced were the areas with no records of bullet holes, because those planes never made it back to get logged.

Still doesn't make sense to me tbh, or maybe it was OP's wording.

Well you‚Äòve squandered another perfectly good hour on Reddit
That was an interesting read. Thanks!
Hindsight is 2021.
can there be survivorship bias for survivorship bias?
Exactly. The bias is pernicious. Trying to be rational is ridiculously difficult. Even though I *know* a fair amount of cognitive biases I *still* stupidly go along like an idiot subject to them and only noticing I'm guilty of one until far too late. 

Need some robot overlords or something. Monkey brain not cutting it.
I don't know shit, I'm just the messenger. I'd look this up and argue with those guys.
Same man, my portfolio was around 2 or 3k in 2017. I was bullish on xvg and ended up losing most of my portfolio on some other shitcoins. If I had left my money in BTC or ETH, I would be wayy better off.
veeery true, thanks for the perspective amidst all this mania
Same, made so, so many wrong trades. Should have kept it all in ETH, would have been way better off.
That's like saying ""if only I had bought the winning lottery ticket "" !
It hurts me to look at my portfolio if I just hadn‚Äôt touched it. Would be up 10k right now if I just left it alone. Instead I tried to trade and find the next hype. All I did was kill my profit.
Knowing this, what's your opinion on Elongate
Sounds like a farmers market.
I stated that I could see it working out on a *realistic* scale, which means not on the entire supply chain market no.
Maybe where you're from, but that doesn't account for the entire globe.

Costco, as an example, isn't present in tons of developed countries (including mine). Nor does the 1% margin apply here, as a study last year indicated an average of 5% across our supermarkets.

True
Dogecoin is the worst of crypto combined. Cult mentality. Tricking newbies who will hold heavy coins for years. No fundamentals. Greedy. Easy money. 

Yes, some people make money. Like the clients of Madoff during years. Until the music stops. 

7 times DOGE has pumped before, 7 times has seen dumped later. The 8th is the charm

It's part of American culture to be hush hush with wages so employers can fuck over their employees easier, it's incredibly stupid
It gives people an incentive to rob you. you‚Äôd be surprised the length some people will go to when there‚Äôs money involved. 

Example: you make some nice gains on your recent investment in MicroPenis ($MCP) coin. you tell you‚Äôre friend that you made $15k off of your investment and how much of a genius you are because you did your own research and completely related and believed in the project. 

A couple months later you‚Äôre friends going through some financial troubles and starts reading up on cryptocurrencies. He reads how coins are able to be sent and received by sending said coins to other peoples addresses. Now he starts digging even deeper on the research and starts reading about privacy coins like Monero which can‚Äôt be tracked and realizes they can be sent anonymously. And he sees that some sites offer the ability to convert other coins into Monero. 

You find yourself tied up to a chair by someone wearing a mask and wielding a $5 hammer from the local department store. And He‚Äôs demanding that you send your micropenis coins to his hardware wallet as fast and as quick as possible...
In the US generally People who talk about money here never actually have any. 

The one who never talks salary or investment #s, he‚Äôs the richest man in the room.
Americans are coming around to the idea that they should be talking about salaries with each other so they aren‚Äôt getting taken advantage of. It‚Äôs bizarre how a country once so heavily unionized is starting to rediscover the power of unions. Still, I think the example above refers more to wealth than salary. For example, I‚Äôd have no problem telling people my salary, but if I had a fat stack of AZMN I‚Äôd keep that to myself.
I'm also german and experienced the complete opposite. Nobody around me ever talked about finances and salaries in detail. Literally nobody I knew. Neither colleagues, nor close friends, nor family members. First time I learned about my parent's salary was after I moved to a different country at age 32 lol.
i cant imagine someone wanting to kill me over a relatively small amount of money either. where does everyone live in this sub where they fear for the lives of not talking about it!
Does it ever create awkwardness when one person makes a lot more than their friends?
Except salaries, right?

Want me to skate next to you and tell you that you‚Äôre beautiful to help motivate you?
Keep at it. Slowly but steady and rest at least a day in between runs. You‚Äôll reach 10k sooner than you may think.
You don‚Äôt even have to do the whole mile in on take. Catching your breath for 1-2 minutes halfway through is totally fine. Or every quarter. Whatever your current fitness level allows you to do.

And try to focus on your surroundings to take your mind off the fact that you‚Äôre actually exercising.

Have fun!
As a former super obese man (6‚Äô01 325lbs) at the beginning of the pandemic who is finally down to a healthy weight from running, you can only get to your goal by starting. Start off slow (low heart rate training is great to look into) and the running won‚Äôt feel as tortuous. My first run was probably as fast as someone who is walking briskly, but i started to get faster over time. After about 12 months of running, I can now finally run 5 miles continuously at a 8:30 pace!
hahaaha... underated
Nike run club app is amazing. Highly recommend
Honestly it‚Äôs true. After hitting 10k in life, it just kinda started working for itself. Not life changing money, but little boosts here and there add up. Not enough to get me anywhere near 100k mind you but enough to get some momentum going.
I made my first 10 this year. I‚Äôm on to about 36,000 now. Off of an initial investment of 450
If you lend me 10k I guarantee I can turn it into 1k for you, does that help?
First time I hit 10k I ended up in the hospital. bank account hit 0 real fast.
Let's smoke it!! I hear Hopium is da bomb!!!!
Geez! Idk how you got that many. That‚Äôs insane!! Thank you btw.
It's a start.  You will be hooked in no time dropping stacks lol
You have to start somewhere. Don‚Äôt compare yourself to others or feel discouraged. I also started with what felt like almost nothing ($500). You got this.
Nothing to laugh about bro, I'm here with you on the lower end and still as good.
Get those gains! This is the way.
What‚Äôs your trip? Need attention? I‚Äôm not sure what you are getting at. I‚Äôm literally trying to be positive here. What‚Äôs the issue?
I‚Äôm not sure what you took from my comment but I wasn‚Äôt trying to brag. Lol. Just trying to motivate. The people toting are usually here on Reddit, so not exactly people I personally hang with. 

I do like to talk with people more successful than myself though. My grandmother always said to surround myself with people I want to be like. So far, grandma is right.
Way to go!! Next thing you know that 400 will be 4000!!
Never sell all of your coins is a lesson I'm abiding by.
I'm starting to sell some of my doge, but I'll keep hodling a decent chunk, just for the off chance that it goes higher than anyone ever imagined.
Yep.

I remind myself every once in a while I decided not to put $100 into BTC when it was 10c a coin.

I would've sold that shit @ $5.

I still think about it though.
The better thought is, thank god I sold and didn't loose them when mtgox went south..
My mom's advice was ""every time you double your money, pull out half"". Obviously it's more of a rule of thumb, but the idea was to balance protecting your gains with leaving some in play.
From bitcoin mogul to getting girls to send pictures of their asshole on reddit.

Hollywood, get this man a biopic.
whats your coins now?
Yep because there‚Äôs a pretty fine line between taking profit too early and not cashing out in time more often than not. There‚Äôs so many penny stocks I wish I sold back in February but held too long cause I was eager for more for instance.
For real.  I thought it would hit $1 eventually but when it didn't budge on the stimmy I moved it to other stuff and ended up losing money on that.

You win some you lose the rest.
> It's an outdated bitcoin copy

It's true it is outdated, although it's only true because Bitcoin itself is outdated. Ultimately they are going to have to pivot. Vitalik Buterin and others many years ago funded a bounty for a project that would allow two-way pegging between the ETH and DOGE blockchains, the so-called ""Dogethereum bridge"", and this recently got completed. So maybe when ETH flippens BTC, DOGE will move to being an ETH token. That would be a big win for the Ethereum ecosystem.
Shut up baby I know it
quantumscape is going to tank into the ground. overvalued spac with no revenue.  This is not the right time for ICLN imo. Nothing wrong with these industries, but be wary about investing in these wsb names very overvalued on fundamentals right now.

Sounds like what I'm after. I just want out of debt. I work full time and make decent money, but I made a lot of bad choices in my early/mid twenties that I'm still dealing with. Selling cars for a loss and buying a new one, then refinancing the negative equity. Don't ever do that. Credit cards, school loans for degrees I didn't finish... I'd like to just dig out of that hole and enjoy my paycheck instead of flushing it to pay debt for shit someone I barely recognize did ten years ago.

$500k in today‚Äôs dollars yes. But not in tomorrow‚Äôs dollars. 

In addition I think 10% is too high of an estimate. It should be more realistic and somewhere around 7% range. Could be even 6% for good measure. Always plan for the worse and hope for the best. 

It also depends on the number of years into retirement. Say your goal number is to retire at 55. That‚Äôs roughly 40 years to love off of 500k. If you‚Äôre retirement age is 45, that‚Äôs 50 years and so forth. 

It‚Äôs naive to say the standard of living won‚Äôt go up in 40-50 years time. You gotta factor that in to your estimate.
Well that's ok if your retirement is only 10 years. Year one equals 500k minus 50, year two equals 450k minus 50, year 3 .....

If you're retired, can you leave your pension income invested in crypto? Can you afford a 3 year bear market when your 500k has been reduced to 450k to take your annual 50k out, but at the bear market price it is worth only 200k, and then take another 50k out, to see the value drop again to 150k and need another 50k out the following year?  And for another year before the next halving? Just how high a bounce are you hoping for in year 4? 4x? So a real value then of 200,000, max, after 4 years of inflation?  Man, it's running out fast!
The point of retirement is not to have to work at all.

With that said yes moving to a LCOL area would definitely prove to be beneficial with a lowered principal.

But let‚Äôs use that 500k number. Using modest returns of 7%, that‚Äôs 35k a year without touching your principal. But you need to factor in inflation. Because tomorrow‚Äôs dollars aren‚Äôt worth as much as today.

So using 3%, 7% - 3% = 4%. So 4% of 500k is 20k. That isn‚Äôt high but definitely still doable. 

But now depending on how many years you plan to retire you may have to live through a bear market or 3. Say for one year, your returns aren‚Äôt great. What then? Do you take out of your original 500k? If so wouldn‚Äôt that screw you in future years?

You have to be conservative with your planning. Yeah sure hope for the best, but most definitely plan for the worst.
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n7rl2y/you_hear_about_the_kid_who_put_in_500_into_a/gxerebe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

Didn‚Äôt feel like retyping all of this.

Your estimates aren‚Äôt conservative enough.
Based on 4% withdraws and returns. But inflation and bear years need to be factored in.

I do 3% with draw rule personally.
How does the math work out for you? Say you live until you‚Äôre 95? With inflation factored in?
I wasn‚Äôt gonna reply but I decided against it and just said fuck it as you need some education. 

Let‚Äôs base this off of the Median US household income of $65k. Using a 3% compounded interest (which btw is really 6% - 3% for inflation) you need 2.1 million dollars to retire with today‚Äôs dollars.

One could argue that 65k is not a comfortable lifestyle. And I would agree with that. At 3.5 million dollars what roughly 100k you can pull out per year without messing with your principal (3.5 mill). 

Why 100k a year? 65k at 3% inflation rate per year equates to around 100k in just 15 years. 

Some may argue that the 6%/3% rule is too conservative. I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs better to air on the side of caution. In regard to staking and crypto, you don‚Äôt want your principal to be in high volatile investments, but rather something that will still give you a return but with less risk eg balanced funds. 

You may interject and say crypto is the future, I‚Äôd simply argue your staking rewards won‚Äôt be as high as they are currently. You won‚Äôt see double digit staking returns as they get more and more people involved. Similar thing happened to CDs as they once were 5%+ before.
I‚Äôm using the 3% withdraw personally. But yes that‚Äôs a good rule of thumb.

However using today‚Äôs 65k median house hold income, with 3% inflation compounded annually. In roughly 20 years it‚Äôll be $120k. In 30, 160k.

So it‚Äôs all relative to age.
No you‚Äôre on track.

But the thing is the ‚Äúinterest‚Äù is debatable. The people thinking 1 million and 10% interest is way off base and not conservative enough. I‚Äôm basing it off 6%, of which you should factor 3% for inflation. So 6-3= 3%. 

3.5 million x .03 = ~100k.

The likelihood of 10% returns year over year aren‚Äôt out of the question but you should always air on the side of caution and factor in a bear market or 3 (depending on how long you plan to retire).
I‚Äôm very troubled that people think they can retire on 500k-1 million. 

I really don‚Äôt think people have thought this through long term. Perhaps we have difffwrent retirement definiations. I don‚Äôt plan to work at all.
Lol.

1 million does not generate 60k that‚Äôs very much untrue.
Assuming 10% returns your 450k nets 45k.

Factoring inflation, your 10% not turns to 7% so 32k.

If you had a bad year that 7% can easily be lowered to 3-4% depending on factors well outside your control, a bear market, another covid, another 9/11, etc.

At even 4%, you‚Äôre looking at only 18k a year. 

This of course assumes that your cost of living never increases and it‚Äôs synonymous of inflation, which of course we know it‚Äôs never the case. 

So no, I really don‚Äôt believe you can retire on 450k at least not with the same comforts that I would like.

Like what?
Imagine in the future were you coul walk around in previous timelines, using virtual reality. How cool would that be
Its call the internet wayback machine.

Google.it and see anywebsite on any particular day.
Honestly it gets very hard to find specific stuff once it reaches a certain age. I feel like Google specifically will bring up stuff from the last 5-10 years but anything more and it‚Äôs impossible unless it was something big. Like I don‚Äôt think any one saved my shit posting in AOL forums in 1998 sadly.

That being said, some of the internet is archived and searchable. If storage keeps getting better we‚Äôll likely see more sites popping up like you suggested. Like some sites have existed for years that copy Reddit comments and store them but I assume infrastructure costs for a free service are too high, it can be hard to find comments if people don‚Äôt preserve them somewhere.

One of the few good things (or potentially bad) about Facebook is they‚Äôve got EVERYTHING archived. The only reason I don‚Äôt try to delete it is so if some bored individual in the distant future wants to, they can see wtf I was doing in 2005 onward. I figure descendants will be the only one curious but it might also be useful for future historians analyzing comments and activity from certain specific time periods. Like just imagine being able to see comments from people in Ancient Rome whenever you want? That would be dope as hell.
r/eddit10yearsago does that on a tiny scale. It's nice to occasionally see decade old stuff in my feed.
I just finished listening to We Are Anonymous. Super interesting to see some of the foundations of what lead to the radicalization that came later out of 4chan. It also kind of makes you realize that even if we could time travel there is no obvious way to stop certain things that came after. Like how do we totally root out radicalization online? We don't. Not then, not now. A totally new strategy needs to be developed as well new tech.

 It's also wild to think that I was in college at the time and somehow was super unaware of all the Anonymous stuff that was going on. I was just that uninterested in tech then.
I think I may have come across something like it before but I think it was only for what reddit looked like 10 years ago. Best bet I can think of is plugging the subreddit into the way back machine.
Holy shit thats cool
I agree. Honestly I hope it does 'go to the moon' - For everyone that is still buying in sake.

But I think it's madness not to realise your gains when you can, sure, you don't need to sell your entire portfolio - but cover your input cost is a must I believe
I mean, if you want to narrow it down to a single investment, then sure. I‚Äôm up 6x on XLM alone. Woohoo. But that‚Äôs a piece of the portfolio. 

Never mind the XRP I bought at $1.80 and sold at $0.24 when the SEC announced their lawsuit thinking it was game over.

You win some, you lose some. That‚Äôs my point. In an extremely volatile market like crypto, it‚Äôs important to take profits and don‚Äôt look back at what ‚Äúcould have been‚Äù. Make your decisions based on the best information you have at the time and don‚Äôt dwell on other outcomes.

I invest in DOGE, and so many people think it's just a get rich quick thing. It really isn't the plan, and some of them are investing so much more than they can afford to lose or wait for. Unbelievable.
That‚Äôs exactly what the r/dogecoin sub Reddit has pinned on top. Only invest so much that you can afford to lose.  
Props to the mods for even warning about the accounts shilling it.  
Nonetheless, it actually has value now. Memes are everything.

You don‚Äôt think ‚Äòthose people‚Äô wouldn‚Äôt spend $30 on lotto tickets or some other hope to get out of their current living situation? The hypocrisy on the cc sub is amazing, you‚Äôre all gambling on something that MOST financial advisers and regulators still warn against investing in! If you put $30 towards Bitcoin when it was at $62k...how‚Äôs that money doing now? Stop fucking hating on people trying and hoping to make their lives better. We‚Äôre all in this for the same reason and kiss my ass if you say ‚Äúit‚Äôs for the tech‚Äù because you ain‚Äôt fooling nobody. You‚Äôre also hoping your investment into a digital coin pays off, and pays off big. Freaking hypocrites.
Not sure if your comment was serious, but for others who may have this question too:

The cryptocurrency markets are just that: markets. It's a process where one side has something the other side is willing to trade for / buy. In this case crypto and fiat. 

What people don't realize is that for every asset you sell, some else has to buy it. You can't sell without buyers, just like how you can't buy without sellers. The money comes from whoever is on the other side of the trade.

If one side outnumbers the other side, prices will rise and fall accordingly. It's just supply and demand, really.
Someone is buying your coins at the price you sell at in hopes that someone can do the same to someone else.

At some point, someone holds the bag. It's close to a zero sum game. If there's a massive winner, then that means there's going to be massive number of losers.
YOLO on boobcoin it is then
You mentioned it for a reason. I don't think you're just randomly stating facts.
I bought into two different ETH alt coins that were top 30 at the time. Obviously I still have the coins but they are worthless now and didn‚Äôt bounce back during the 2020 boom.
Who the hell is setting stop losses on crypto? A speculative alt coin at that?
It means everyone is holding because it goes up. The second people start cashing out, it starts going down, and people start cashing out en mass. Doesn‚Äôt really look like a bubble till after the fact but holding and staking for the sole purpose of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù is exactly what a bubble is
People holding an asset only because they think someone else will buy it for more, not because of the actual intrinsic value is the sign of a bubble.  A bubble doesn't have to be volatile, just that the market price is driven more by anticipation of future prices than an actual evaluation of today's value.

""Owning that house is only worth 300K to me as a place to live, but I'll pay 440K for it since I can probably sell it for 500K""  housing bubble 

""Based on the dividends it is paying out, and how much I expect it to pay out, I'd happily pay $80 for a share of that stock but since someone else will probably pay me $120 for it next year no problem paying $100"" stock market bubble

Now ask yourself, are people paying 60K for a bitcoin because that's how badly they want one or it generates a return from anything other than the next sucker who will pay more?
Did you sell or are you holding?
If you paid for a house in crypto can you do a smart contract on the ethereum chain for a home?? 

Does it ever turn into fiat? 

Next time I try out a lil trading I'll be starting with a 50-100k account I think. Was fun.
Here (another EU country), income tax rates apply when you sell within 1 year. tax rate for me would be 50%. No fucking way. I take 100% of the risk with money that was already taxed (income tax on my earnings from my 9 to 5) to be taxed again? Nah, thanks. I'll hold or rent a mailbox in Portugal.
Glad I'm not those people. Sounds awful.
Basically there is a limit to how much Bitcoin can be created but there isn't for Dogecoin, this means demand has to grow with the amount of dogecoin available to retain it's price, something that realistically can't happen forever. That's why dogecoin has been compared to a longterm ponzi-scheme because the only way for the value to be maintained is people continuing to buy into it, like a ponzi-scheme. When people demand stops supply will continue to grow, crashing its price. 

This is not a maybe but an inevitability of Doge, the question is when because before then there is a lot of potential money to be made. And obviously when the price starts to crash demand will plummet to extreme lows.
I have a buddy that dropped 1 grand on it at 4 cents.  I've tried to encourage to sell off some but I don't know if he has or has not.  It'd be a shame not to see anything off that.
Dogecoin is not a long term hold lol
Sure thing. Doge is literally a joke. It was  created as a terrible shitcoin with bad fundamentals to lampoon shitcoins. I think it's cool that it's bringing people into crypto but it's success is just built on hype. I'm worried about the people that'll eventually get burned because they put their life savings into doge. Doge doesn't do anything special on it's own and there are other coins are better bets long term. ETH/BTC are expensive and not as sexy but will last. Aside from that, I can't tell you if long term winners will be ALGO,LINK, XLM, XRP,  Cardano, or others but it won't be Doge. Take some gains, don't fret if Doge makes it to $1 and find a coin with real utility to invest in long term. It is pretty awesome that you got in at .04, congrats!

Edit: u/youllnevermemealone did a great job of explaining why it'll inevitably collapse
Imo it gives people ammo to call crypto a scam. ... because doge is basically a scam
Dude, there are literally 10s of thousands of shitcoins. Check out moonshots
China's (secret) venture into crypto
No, 80% of it is not owned by 3 whales
It‚Äôs not a stock haha. Do you even know what FOMO stands for? If I had FOMO I‚Äôd be trying to buy the coin.
So your saying early investors in crypto currencies don‚Äôt make money by convincing more people to invest in crypto currencies? Seriously dude, it‚Äôs a scam, even if you make money on it it‚Äôs at the expense of someone because it does not do anything, there is no revenue generated by crypto.
it took me since november until last week to get it through my friends thick head that doge is not a 5 year investment. problem has been he has consistently been ‚Äúproven right‚Äù because of the irrational market. but, through a post on here describing the mechanics and problems with doge in much better terms than i. he finally gets it, sadly, now he‚Äôs lecturing me on market caps, development, design and how doge is a risky short term investment (shit i‚Äôve tried to get through his head for months) and how he always planned to pull out...

i assume most people are the same; they have no idea about crypto and just see the hype and get on board with doge, xrp, etc. because they are ‚Äúcheap‚Äù to buy many; not reading into the reason as to why they‚Äôre ‚Äúcheap‚Äù, and expecting them to blow up to 400k+ like bitcoin.

my main grief with all this is how coins like polkadot has essentially become stable coins by barely moving an inch since february, while all these shitcoins, dead projects, niche projects and centralized coins and scams are climbing the ladder.

it‚Äôs like... you can choose; in one hand, you have a guaranteed loss of money each second by design (i.e. doge) and in the other hand you have a guaranteed profit each second by design (dot); and every single person on the planet essentially decided to go with the first hand, because fuck sound investments, logic, and reason. let‚Äôs all yolo into the absolute worst options on the market because apparently every single person will do exactly the same terrible decision...
And for every person jumping in, another is jumping out, until there is no one left to jump in , and a bunch of people see their investment wiped out.
My only issue with doge is the limitless aspect. There will always be more. That scares me long term. I‚Äôm same as you. I‚Äôve played in doge, but I‚Äôm accumulating BTC and ETH.
I‚Äôm pretty sure one wallet owes something like 28% if dogecoins

dude yesterday during a very stressful and rushed end of the workday, one of my coworkers was straight up losing his mind because he was planning on throwing $3000 into Doge when it was at .40 and it had just hit .60. I recognized the feeling immediately as a while back I spent around 2 weeks in DEEP depression when GME shot up, because I had heard about the potential squeeze in August when it was $8 a share. I finally realized that thinking about money that intensely is just not something my head is prepared for and I now try to avoid it, or at least moderate it if I can. 

I'm just ranting now, but all of this was exacerbated by another coworker (who is extremely knowledgeable in our industry, but who unfortunately allows that knowledge to make him confident that he knows fucking everything about entirely unrelated stuff) telling him that ""DOGE is going to be the next Bitcoin, just put in the $3000 now and don't check it for 3 more years when you're going to retire off it"" (this was said entirely in earnest btw). 

I wanted really badly to try to explain the concept of deflation and what it would take for DOGE to reach the $1000 price that he was predicting, but I've learned that the 2nd coworker I described is someone who gets super aggressive in defending their (moronic) beliefs and it just wasn't a battle I wanted to pick at the time

just one more example: this dude got straight up indignant with me the other day when I said oil is a fossil fuel because ""new science is showing that we don't know where oil comes from, it's actually a living creature, if oil came from fossils then why are we still finding dinosaur fossils in the ground"" JFC
DOGE would have to have a market cap of (and I'm pretty sure I did the math correctly here) $9,060,100,000,000 to hit $7 USD.

That's $9 ***Trillion***. Around 4x the entire *current* Crypto market cap,
I actually did the math earlier for a reply to someone else:

>DOGE would have to have a market cap of (and I'm pretty sure I did the math correctly here) $9,060,100,000,000 to hit $7 USD.
>
>That's $9 ***Trillion***. Around 4x the *entire* current Crypto market cap,
I was trying to imply that he already chose a good project without overtly shilling it.
No one used the word ""stupid"". But it's absolutely possible to make good investing decisions and bad investing decisions. It's not pure chance.

For example if you bought near the peak in 2017 (as I did), that probably wasn't the wisest move. Lots of people were saying crypto was in a bubble and would crash, but I bought anyway because I got greedy and careless. Not unlucky.

I then hodl'd through crypto winter, but not because I got lucky, but because I got smart, and realised it would come back up again.

There are also objective questions you can ask about projects to put them in a risk category, eg what's the liquidity like? Are there any whales who could dump the price? What's the supply cap of the coin/token? Is there a real world use case? No, it doesn't tell you for sure which projects will/won't catch on, but it gives you an indication of how risky this investment is.

It's all about putting in the hours to do your research before investing. As Samuel Goldwyn said, ""the harder I work, the luckier I get.""

This is very true, regarding risk, and I‚Äôm prepared to lose everything I‚Äôve put in. If you can‚Äôt get back what you‚Äôve put in in a reasonable time frame you‚Äôve definitely gone a little far on your risk factor.

Your risk is considerably less if you aren‚Äôt investing in outright guesses, however.
Ohh no more spreading
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs practically possible to buy that many lottery tickets.
Huh?
Except we are not sheep. We are human beings, all with the ability to make educated and logical decisions based off our own reasoning. Holding others responsible for your own actions just doesn‚Äôt hold up. If I listen to bad advice, take it to heart and make a mistake, it‚Äôs my fault and my fault alone. If a Shepard leads a group of humans off a cliff, then they are all kind of idiots right? No one says Sharon Tate is blameless just because Manson was the one to told her to kill.
Exactly... spare a thought for the doge fomo crowd.
My bad!
That‚Äôs not what makes it a scam. I‚Äôm not gonna double check so please correct me and lmk but wasn‚Äôt the dude who was building it scramming on deadlines and being a little deceptive about it? Or like not being fully honest of its capabilities or something? I know I was seeing a lot of people unhappy
Yeah Sure!! Thousands of people lol comical
Lol that sucks. But yeah I know that binance supports it, and now webull does as well (but I am not sure if webull has a wallet since I don't invest through webull)
Yeah math and actual stories seem to be kind of a big deal about these hundreds of stories.

I mean I get the warning & it's important but it's misplaced. The caveat should be aimed at SuriusCoins not the one MemeCoin that can't go over a 1$. Do you really think Reddit would bail on it if it drop to .7 (because that's what it would take to whipe someone out atm). If it was at >1.01 or something then yeah, serious risk that would actually make 100 stories possible.

For now all these SuriusCoins have a greater chance of wiping out someones savings.
First thing you‚Äôre gonna need is 0 experience in any form of investing. 

Find a trading app and lie about your knowledge to gain access -then hit it. 

Maybe start with US Crude $10 - make sure you leverage and leave it overnight with no limits.

üëç
Yea no shit üòÇ
You should really buy Reddit‚Äôs Moons instead of these shitcoins
Yeah, but I've bought more since lol
RIP my sleep starved brain
Well it's on the up again now. I know what you mean. We should learn to bank some profits I guess.
It does but only if you are placing massive amounts of trades daily all month long. The way they average it over a period of 30 days your rate could change majorly and you could actually find yourself paying slightly more in certain situations on pro than you would on Coinbase. Plus I think their entry level price break is either 100-150k (can‚Äôt remember this second) but you really need to be trading 1 mill per month or better in order for the whole ‚Äúbetter fees on pro‚Äù to really apply.
Shit man fees were the nail in the coffin on that exchange for me lol. There‚Äôs just WAY to many ways to access, buy, trade, sell crypto that I don‚Äôt have to mess with them. I‚Äôm with about 120 different providers now so Coinbase is in my past.
Don't have to pay taxes if you only lose money.
These people are just fear mongering... YOLO
In the US, you're supposed to pay taxes on your crypto earnings. Additionally some tax filing software needs to be a premium edition to enter in crypto.
Only if you make a profit!
There are capital gains taxes for trading crypto. The government wants theirs
If you do taxes on your own you're fine. But most tax software adds a charge for having stocks in your taxes.

For free lol
I don't know if there's validity to it, but part of the reason I pay someone to do my taxes is to have someone to blame and shift responsibility to if the IRS ever deems something amiss.

*I gave him my info, he gave me back authorization forms, I signed & paid 'em.*
These people invested into some stupid catchy coin because they listened to a youtuber and now theyre broke and sold on a loss . Taxes arent that bad if you know what you are doing. Hell, trump only paid $455 bucks as a billionaire. Im sure these clowns can do the same thing from their drywall installing earnings.
Turbo tax charges extra for day trading taxes
Or you can just not pay taxes . What are they going to do, come after you, the government doesn't do that
In the US it‚Äôs $2500.
Is this some sort of unwritten rule? Everything I‚Äôve ever seen says you must report all capital gains, no matter how small. I‚Äôm not doubting that it‚Äôs pretty easy to ‚Äúget away with‚Äù not reporting smaller amounts, but is that what you‚Äôre saying or am I missing something?
why can't you withdraw it?

I had a robinhood account, got a $2 stock and sold it for $1.50 later and withdaew every last cent.
I was thinking the same thing, too. What a coincidence!

I‚Äôm originally from Austin, grew up there. It‚Äôs insane how much the city has changed.

Its like playing a video game with infinite lifes, money and power.

The game becomes boring very fast because they are no challenges or things to aim for.
It‚Äôs terrible right? I always wondered how much easier things could‚Äôve been if I had family to support me, or the credit to back me in the beginning. It‚Äôs awful starting out with nothing, it‚Äôs even harder making half a life in a successful career and becoming disabled and having to start over with nothing. Bro those little trades in the beginning that netted me only $5 after fees because I had no leverage meant everything to me! They still do!! I get what you‚Äôre saying - and I‚Äôm glad to hear you‚Äôre doing well now. Like I said just try EVERYTHING!! Doesn‚Äôt matter how many times you fail get back up and try again and some time you will get it. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I started over with nothing and no one. Just the skills that I had - and each new attempt brought on new skills that I took with me and added to. I‚Äôm still not where I want to be, but that‚Äôs because my goals evolve before I achieve them to keep me moving towards more. Best of luck my friend I wish you well!!
I'm a programmer and curious if you have any on hand examples?
Anti-patterns is a brilliant term lol
Lol
They were. Same deal with seatbelts. Both examples of a more literal ""survivorship bias.""
DING
Assume planes only have 2 ""spots,"" they can be hit, the nose or the tail. And assume that planes get hit randomly, so tail shots are just as likely as nose shots. They find that more planes come back from missions with holes in the tail than holes in the nose. You might be inclined to armor the tail, because you've seen a bunch of planes with holes in the tail and very few with holes in the nose. However you actually want to armor the nose. Why?

Well, the reason more planes come back with holes in the tail is that the planes that get shot in the nose crash and never come back. When you only analyze the planes that ""survived,"" you're ignoring the data about planes which didn't survive/make it back.

If you could magically study ALL the planes (even the ones that crashed and never came back) you'd see a bunch of crashed planes with holes in the nose, and a bunch of still flying planes with holes in the tail. And you'd correctly decide to armor the  noses. 

If you can't magically see all the planes, you have to make connections to come to the correct decision. If planes are just as likely to get hit in the nose as the tail, and we never see planes which were hit in the nose, it must be because planes who get hit in the nose don't make it home. So we should armor the nose.
The planes made it back, making them evidence of what is working. They didn't get hit in the weak spots. Like, the ones that do take bullets in weak spots don't return
The places that lacked any recorded damage were the fuselage as it connects to the tail (it's thinner, damage here most likely caused the tail to seperate from the rest of the plane or caused them to lose rudder/elevator control) the engines (ww2 bombers were heavy, and losing engines greatly decreased their ability to maneuver or return home) the cockpit (a solid hit here would likely kill the pilot) and about the midway point on the wings. (They get narrower further toward the tips. Damage towards the tips still leaves them with plenty of wing left and damage closer to where the wing connects to the fuselage was less likely to cause them to lose the wing.)
Thanks. Gonna check it out right away.

I know you're just playing off a saying, it got me thinking though. The actual saying is very peculiar considering how 2020 went.
I fucked myself over with Dragonchain.
A lottery ticket has a known prize. Some of my idiotic purchases didn't have a winner. I would say it's more like the Asian process of cooking rice, put it in the cooker and leave it alone until it is ready.
I haven't done my research yet to have an opinion, sorry.
To hodl or to cancle? That is the question.
Haha, I‚Äôm actually in it but it‚Äôs my gamble money

Lol okay I've more than 10x my investment but go on üëç

I'd be salty if I didn't get in early too.
Can anyone elaborate on safemoon being a scam? 

Is this just because any price increase is only the result of others entering in anticipation of the price increasing further from more people entering (i.e FOMO)? 

What gives other cryptocurrencies value, utility/application?

That's not just US culture...
Being open with coworkers in the same paygrade as you and telling your friends and family how much money you have are different things. 

The former prevents your boss from fucking you over and the latter does nothing except cause resentment. There's a good reason why people have their lives fall apart when they win enormous sums of money from the lottery. It might be that lotto winners are likelier to have bad judgment, but that doesn't stop their friends, family and neighbors from coming over and asking for money.
In this thread though, it's more about family members wanting a cut of your money. And I mean, all the way to distant relations you never knew existed. People are greedy.
It‚Äôs also illegal for employers to tell employees they are forbidden to talk about wages with each other but it‚Äôs still done everyday. At least half of Americans are officially anti-union and anti-labor yet most are labor and unions would benefit then so much. We have an abundance of morons who vote against their own interest.
Plot twist: If you let your employer fuck you over, then you may be the incredibly stupid one
[deleted]
If you become one of the better paid employees then you‚Äôll understand why they don‚Äôt go around talking about it.
Yeah try explaining why to your colleague's. Telhey just don't share
That's not only why people hushed about money. They don't know you and assume you will steal their money or only become your friend to get money off of you. It is a poverty mentality among Americans who had parents or grandparents go through some hardtimes. They passed down to their kids. You're also right but there is more than one reason why they're like that.
You're talking about salary. They're talking about investments. I'm not discussing my total $$ of investments with coworkers
It's more that the wealthy and powerful (politicians and those who fund them) want it to stay that way so American education system makes kids learn useless things that aren't even real like friendly pilgrims and manifest destiny but they don't teach kids a fkin thing about personal finance and investing.  And we're indoctrinated to not discuss money on purpose.

Guess what tho? You know who talk about money all the time, and very specifically to each other at the country clubs? RICH PEOPLE.  Where do you think they all get the tips on when a stock or some other opportunity is gonna pop? From each other.  They swap inside knowledge down to the cent.  It's in their best interest to keep the middle class middle class and the ppl scraping to get by scrapin. 

It's fully intentional.  The only thing that separates the wealthy from the rest is information. They aren't smarter, or lucky or have any super powers.  They simply learned either from their family or a friend with a rich family. This is why you can only find old, already priced in news on the internet. This is why there are $10k a plate fundraisers. To swap info on the DL.  If everyone knew the basics at 16 yrs old we'd all be wealthy, then no one would be wealthy. 

Do y'all realize the only thing any person needs to do to become financially free is to be taught from a young age how to save money, how to invest thru your parents at age 16, and by age 20 you'd already know the fundamentals.  Nothing special. Conservative boomer gains at 6% are even enough when you start young.  By 30 you'd be able to buy land and build a home. By 40 you'd be doing work you love cuz you can.  It's supplemental income.

Yet Americans are like * Here's my most intimate thoughts on sex politics civil rights religion for all to see on social media.  But ask me about my salary or plans for the future?  Step back bruh, now you're getting too personal! "" 

The whales can only stay whales if there are guppies and krill to eat. They know this of course and will help maintain breeding grounds.  Whales can't eat other whales. Gotta keep those krill krillen'
This sounds more like paranoid delusions than reality. Most wealthy people aren‚Äôt getting robbed and kidnapped on a regular basis.  
   
If you‚Äôre friends would fucking tie you up and demand money because you became rich, then you should pick better friends.   
    
Fear of that happening is an insane reason to not talk about money.
I'm getting the vibe that your friends aren't very nice man
You're absolutely right, anyone can turn on you at any minute, you never know.
Somehow that sounds more appealing than having your so called ""friends"" constantly ripping on you because of this micropenis.
Thanks for the idea üòé
It's because salary is such a wild west thing in most of our workplaces.  

The people who want to keep the quietest are usually the ones making considerably more than their peers. It is another tool to divide workers.
AMZN?  Then yes I agree
Many places specifically tell you in America that you are not to discuss compensation with fellow employees. It's quite common.

That momentum is certainly perspective changing.  Throughout most of my 20s I wasn't making tons of money and it felt like saving small amounts wasn't going to add up to anything substantial so I would just spend my money on beer and other stupid little things as soon as I got it.  A couple years ago I realized how much I could have if I had been saving even $50-100/month over all those years and started to really pay attention.  Once I got the ball rolling it became harder and harder to waste my money.  I managed to land a decent paying job a couple years ago and now I'm more frugal with my money than I've ever and I have a little nest egg that I dont want to see decrease in size after all the work I put in to get it where it is now.  It isn't quite where I want it to be yet, but its getting there.
Im happy for you!

Gonna be interesting to see if the same happens to me :)
What? Then how is it true? You just said it's true to the statement that once you have 10k you'll easily have 100k. Then you continued to say you have no where near 100k.
Congrats on that, glad other are sharing in the gains right now. This last week has been pretty incredible for me as well. Got up to 10k because of etc (yeah I know it's a shitcoin) but reinvested it into ctsi at the bottom when it hit CB and feel incredibly lucky right now. I actually just wanted to hodl ctsi initially, because the speculation it's a great coin with a ton of room to grow, people said $2 by august, yet here we are at like 1.50, and I've already doubled my money again lol. Guess I kind of have a goal to make it to 100k by the end of the year. Idk if thats feasible, but it's a goal
Sounds like Doge
America and the absurd hospital prices...

As a Swede i honestly feel sorry for you..
Should‚Äôve spend that 10k to emigrate to a better country
I‚Äôm sorry that happened. Hospital bills are the worst.
Divorce did that to me. I got zero dollars in her bassets, but she got all my non retirement cash. Slowly getting back to where I was before.
America is fucked..I hit 10k in the UK and end up in hospital, I leave with the 10k I went in with + interest. Proper taxing system. But sure our people are learning how fun tax evasion is now and trying to dismantle the NHS.
See 10k for me would be the above guys nest egg, but my version i guess. If I ended up going to the hospital again somehow for something my insurance somehow didnt cover it means I'm dead lol. 

I had open heart surgery. The hospital paid the $120k for that. Many other things Medicaid or whatever else paid for. Had a finger amputation too. Now though I will say I wouldnt leave the house without medical thatll actually cover stuff, but I also became a weird case after the amputation where I qualify more easily for full Medicaid and crap.

Exactly, I was mining, in2013 I cashed out at the magical peak of 1610 that time. And never wanted to touch btc or crypto again, i had699 ltc and 4btc mined. I wa shappy with the sell as mtgox went belly up 1 month later. Even my payment was delayed 4 weeks, I was writing them daily letters on wtf.

Now, seeing all my friends who doesnt even know where it started and what a crypto is are sitting on like multiple hundred k's of alts and I just bought 100k celr coin hoping to sell in 5 years at whatever :D
Oh, I'm doing quite well with other investments right now. It wasn't so much of a lack of strategy, but at that time, it seemed a near certainty that the SEC or some other regulatory body was going to impose restrictions. Things weren't nearly as widespread back then and the all but pervasive common knowledge at the time was you'd be stupid to stay in.

I'm the end, I was never a long term speculator because it seemed like such a certainty things wouldn't work out. The few people that decided to not make a quick 20k just before that first massive rally were really guessing.
You got a suggestion for where I can learn more about this? I hopped in on the meme with doge because I could afford to and I was discouraged out of buying some bitcoin back when they were 25 bucks a pop. So I'm fine with doge going to 0 and me losing everything, I just wanted the insurance. But I've been learning about crypto a lot as a result and am interested to learn more.
The battery manufacturer industry is difficult to evaluate, for sure.  This is why I haven't yet pulled the trigger on any companies in that space yet.  I agree that your concerns are valid.  It's difficult.
Hoard like a dragon!! 


lol I do get what you‚Äôre saying tho.
Does my username lead you to believe that I dont know about this one simple trick
What about Singapore
Can you comment on the government and weather patterns the last few years? Thailand is up on my list due to the freeish healthcare.
The 500k remains untouched and is purely to generate growth via market appreciation and returns. And inflation is worth considering indeed, which is why I want make enough to continue reinvesting to offset it and slowly increase my standard of living over time.

The median American single person income is roughly 32k. Whatever numbers we use, we should use that as a baseline for yearly market appreciation. Depends a lot on retirement goals too. My goal isn't Teslas and luxury; maintaining today's relatively humble but pleasant lifestyle without the tedious fiat mine is enough for me. If you want more, your numbers will definitely be different.
> The point of retirement is not to have to work at all.
> 
> 

for me the point of retirement is not to work when i dont feel like working... but you are right 500k is a bit tight.

I was disgustingly poor following some mismanaged medical situations. Like, however poor you think when I say that, like 2x more poor than that.

""Comfortable"" for me just isn't very much.

Also, if I had a million dollars, I probably wouldn't make it to 95 tbh.
Man I was living a decent life with 20k agi. Work a few days a week, play video games. Fun times.
Your overall point about being conservative with your estimates is good, but I feel like you‚Äôre forgetting something. Most people‚Äôs biggest expense comes in the form of a mortgage or rent. If your house is paid off, 65k/year is significantly more than it looks like because now you only have to worry about property taxes, food, utility bills, transportation, and healthcare. That 65k stretches pretty far once you eliminated a ~$1300 housing bill.
Ok that makes sense to me thanks
I don't know where you live.

If it's Norway, Switzerland, idk Luxembourg, you're right.

If it is Nigeria, you are basically a billionaire.

Reddit is international.

So you CAN even retire with 10.000$.

I can't. Same as you. But with 1.5 Mio$ i could keep on living my life without working for another 50 years approximately.

3 Mio$ would make me feel rich. I could(!) stop working. Not sure if i would. I like my job. I would most likely bring some money to it.

But i wouldn't cashout completely.  i believe in crypto. i would partly  cash out, get some apartments to rent them, buy myself another small place to live, and some luxury for less than 100-200k.

And maybe hodl for life.![gif](emote|trashpanda_emote|trashpanda)
Yea, i dont even know the ave rate on savings accounts.
i don‚Äôt plan to retire in the US; as higher quality of life can be had elsewhere at lower prices.
total value of all moons distributed last time is \~$400k

I really am thinking bailing as it reaches that point is the wisest choice.
I suppose the key to success here is to not dwell on your mistakes and instead focus on the accomplishments. Hey, you sold early but you made money and reinvested, having learned in the process.
Yeah I bought at .13 and sold at .35 after it came down from .46. Then bought at .28 and sold at .24 lol. Then bought at .30 and I‚Äôm still in. Shame on me for being weak. It‚Äôs a learning experience. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
Me too but this has taught me that hindsight is 20/20. Wish I had sold my car and invested that at $.0002, but we can‚Äôt all be so lucky.

I have a lot of friends in that boat and I don't understand why. They're smart, they research their crypto but are stuck on doge as their claim to fame without recognizing it truly is crap.
Uh.. I wouldn't take ""reddit hype"" at face value. Could be tons of bots or people trying to fool others into jumping in the bandwagon and then dump em. Just because people are hyping a stock it doesn't mean it will keep going up. By the time you are reading it it might have hit the top of the mountain. You can never tell where a stock will top out if you are going exclusively by hype on the internet.
Unfortunately a lot of these new people drawn into it don‚Äôt have the same mindset as you and are in fact spending money they can‚Äôt afford to oose

I'm sorry but it's hard to look at people who buy lotto tickets and think that they are gonna win. Everybody wants to get rich but everybody should be able to look at the risk and figure out if it's worth it. Of course I hope that everybody gets rich and all that, but when someone acts reckless it's hard to be compassionate.
Gambling in a scam meme coin isnt the same as investing in a real coin with fundamentals.
I‚Äôm a hypocrite because I invest in coins I believe will serve a purpose because the underlying tech compared to coins that are only pumped off of hype?
Real question as I try to conceptualize this. If everyone is selling off at the same time, how are their trades going through? Wouldn‚Äôt that mean that there have to be just as many buyers as there are sellers (or around the same amount)? Wouldn‚Äôt sales just stagnate as everyone sells and nobody buys? Then what happens?
So exchange it for Bitcoin and take it out that way
And someone in the middle is taking a small transaction fee and simultaneously organizing trading competitions.
Sounds like a pyramid scheme.

I would hope not in the market we have been in for about a decade now. We will see when the market shifts.
First of all, thank you very much for your well written explanation. After I commented I read a few articles that basically said the exact same thing so it seems like you are right on the money. Seems like the hard part is the ‚Äúwhen‚Äù.

Is it possible for dogecoin to become a ‚Äúdeflationary‚Äù currency the same way Bitcoin is? Or will it just continue to produce more and more which would guarantee a crash?
Then, isn't the whole x-coin (where x is any virtual crypto currency) thing just a ponzi scheme? Ultimately I'd see no difference between Bitcoin and Dogecoin fad. They are demanded less because they bring new features to our currency system, but more because everyone buys them because they think they can cash out later for more money. The whole thing is a ponzi scheme.
Thanks for explaining this. Is ADA different in this regard?
[deleted]
That's not a valid answer. You're positing an opinion as if it were a substantiated fact.
Your FOMO has mutated into loathing of dogecoin, clearly. You can call it whatever you want, all I know is, I‚Äôm making money as you rely on your stamp collection for a profit some day. I‚Äôm donating a $100 in your name to a children‚Äôs hospital in your name. Thanks Dogecoin!
If you let him go ahead and invest in doge back in November, he'd have gained over 5000% today. Much more than BTC or ETH will gain for a long, long time...
Honest question, Why can‚Äôt Doge be capped at some point regulating a total number of coins. And if it can be, how would that be done? 

BTC can still be mined, but when the equation is solved, no more coins. I understand that.
Your part on GME is very true. At first, it's very hard not to overthink, but with time, we're starting to handle these situations better. Or at least, these are my two cents on it. Personally, i'd rather take that as a lesson : i missed an opportunity, i won't miss the next one, or the one after that. There will be more, i just have to be patient, be prepared (not rushing blindly into the unknown to get burned) and go for it. I hope you're doing better now.

The other part on Doge makes me want to react on two things that both our stories have in common :

\- We know the market a bit more (at least, we think we do), so we want to warn others. If you interfere, not to say ""don't !"" of course but, just to give information, they'll turn on you at some point, and you'll very likely lose. In the end, that's not your business (i expect strangers to say that), so we better stay away. Not all the time, but almost. 

\- Maybe investing 3k at a 0.60 Doge might turn profitable for him. We don't know. Personally, i thought Doge would rise to 0.08 to 0.1. Investing at 0.07 for example was a bad idea for me. I was totally wrong. We're thinking it's a mistake at .60. Maybe it is, maybe it's not. Maybe Doge will reach .90, 1$ or 1.20 at its peak. Who knows ? 

It's a risky gamble, but it could work. That's why i'd rather stay out of it and not interfere with others' business.
Hahaha I appreciate the vote of confidence. Invrstment decisions can really wear down the soul, especially when I'm currently down yet could've made a mint on that doge I sold in January.
>For example if you bought near the peak in 2017 (as I did), that probably wasn't the wisest move. Lots of people were saying crypto was in a bubble and would crash, but I bought anyway because I got greedy and careless. Not unlucky.

People say crypto is a bubble all the time though. Sometimes it crashed sometimes it didnt. What you are doing here is result based analysis. You had no way of knowing if it was near a peak or not. Just like you could absolutly not be sure that it would ever get back up again.

>No, it doesn't tell you for sure which projects will/won't catch on, but it gives you an indication of how risky this investment is

Exactly, you only have some indicators and the rest is luck. Even more so when it comes to crypto because every possible indicator just screams 'this is a gamble'.

It is possible to invest very safely but those kind of investments will never double your money in a year. Crypto is the opposite of safe no matter how much research you do.
Yeah, true, though that's because it is still being shorted. Nobody is selling, and the hedgefunders are buying themselves time before the inevitable blowout.
But I was told spread means safe(moon)

It's worth my money
 regardless, I'm making money. I like to gamble. Just don't be left holding the bag.
My buddy made 40k off safemoon. You think he was the only one? So yes, thousands of people. He only invested $800
Ah true. I always see ads on twitter about crypto.com supporting it as well but I saw some people complaining about them in this thread so I‚Äôd prob stay away from there. I obv hope everyone makes money I just think a lot of people seem misguided and too many view the coin as a hodl, I would likely be tryna pump and dump. Especially if I only ‚Äúowned‚Äù it on robinhood or whatever
You are kidding right
I am actually familiar with oil and gas market in us a little bit. For example - I wonder if one could buy cheap gas in the market in June / July 
And maybe almost double the money by selling in January-March . I seriously doubt US oil will go to $10 anytime soon . I have done some trading but remain a student / still learning .
I'm seeing that

What?
this is the way
Or if you hodl. OP is just pointing out newbies.
In fact you can deduct loses, I remember the time I lost around 20k playing with CFDs, I got to deduct 3k from that year's taxes.
I thought I was donating to a charity. Does that mean no write off?
Why do you pay taxes on your gains and dont get rebates on your losses. All the kyc I dodge and look for new platforms to withdraw my money... but for now I've registered all my crypto wallets with family members, so I hit just about the maximum and cash out there
Don't have to pay taxes if you're underage

Yolo is the white man's FUBU
Lol
To be clear, you‚Äôre paying *capital gains* tax, based on the realized gain on loss when you sell your coin. Legally, such a sale will be considered to occur when you use coin as a medium of exchange. So when you [buy a Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/support/bitcoin) with Bitcoin, you‚Äôll pay tax on the bitcoin‚Äôs appreciation between when you bought it, and when you bought the car.
You literally just enter your net gains under ""additional income"".... that's it... it's that simple. unless you held over a year and then it goes into a different box
Still have to pay federal taxes
[deleted]
Depends on how you file/what you need from TurboTax. If you‚Äôre just filing a simple W-2 it‚Äôs free. But if you‚Äôre self employed you it costs money to buy the package that guides you thru filling out all that bullshit.
Turbotax is free if you do personal taxes on basic things; when you start doing business tax, then you have to pay money for the higher editions because the basic ones won't provide you with the proper lines for your return.
Congrats on not having an HSA, or a mortgage, or realistically anything that would require more than filing just the form 1040
Because you‚Äôre poor.
Turbo tax is great if you only need to file a W-4 & don't make a ton of money. In any other case turbo tax is brutally expensive
If you make under a certain threshold it's free.
It depends on how much money you make, if you're a student, etc. It's definitely not free for most. And it's only free for the prior so when you file in the future and do hit the marks that require paying, that they have all your info and it's convenient so you'll just do it.
depending on the individual, it is not free

for example: everyone part of the gig economy
Same people tell me they pay on turbo tax and im like just dont select that plus bullshit lmao .
I remember it was free if you qualify to file a 1040-EZ, but costs to file more complicated forms and for state taxes I think.
Intuit is one of the main reasons we have a fucked up tax system in the US where it‚Äôs on us to go through the complications of filing.
It's usually free for people under certain income thresholds
E filing your taxes via turbo tax does tho. That‚Äôs probably what your family encountered.
You must live in a state with no state income tax, or you didn‚Äôt use TurboTax to file your state return.   That‚Äôs where basic TurboTax makes its money - when you file state taxes.   Anything other than basic 1040 filing tasks quickly jacks it up to ‚ÄúDeluxe‚Äù certainly not free then, even with discounts by brokers like Fidelity and others.
Why the fuck doesn't your government do all this? 

You're coerced into paying a charge to sort out the tax affairs that your government requires you to do. It's pretty much a tax on having to do your taxes.


I live in Australia and for a good 15 years now you've been able to do your tax online. It used to require a special app, but they've gotten a lot better lately and it's just a web app now. 90 percent of it is pre-filled, as just about every source of income has to report your earnings direct to the tax office, so the bulk of people log in, look at it, go ""yep"", click submit. 

Even if you've got deductions and complications, you can use the online application or get the paper one with 37 pages from the tax office and do it that way.

About a week later your return is electronically transferred to your bank account, seeya next year.

It just seems that in the US, land of the free,  you get nickel and dimed to death with every single thing you do. To the point where the ""nickel and dimed"" phrase is easily recognisable as that happening.
Freetaxusa
I had used turbo tax since you bought it on disc and through to the 'free file' when that all started. Then they decided to charge if you had 1099s. Switched to H&R block for a couple free file years then they aged me out of 'free' at 52 (such an odd age to do that) so switched to freetaxusa. I'll never go back. Free is free is free - 1099s, odd tax forms, doesn't matter, it's free.

If they haven't started charging you yet, just wait for it. You'll get older and more complicated than EZ and they'll make you pay.
Every year I‚Äôve filed my CPA always gets me more than what I would get if I ‚Äúsubmitted‚Äù my taxes on turbo tax. Maybe I have a great CPA but over the past 4 years and factoring in how much she costs, she still gets me back more.
apparently your taxes are about as complicated as a single w2, you have to pay to file your capital gains tax
Can‚Äôt use the free version once you make over 60k I believe. Those were good days.
It‚Äôs only free under a certain income. Your family is low key flexing on you.
it's free for poors
Depends on the form being filed.
I think turbo tax costs money to file at a state level, so people who live in states with income tax incur a fee for filing their taxes. This is only a guess, I file for free every year as well; but I have relatives in Cali that swear it costs money.
You only have pay if you are doing more complex shit like hsa.. 401k.. investments..shit like that
Yrs ago I quit using them and had to change an email.....way too much spam . Do you still get a bunch of spam or have they made more  opt out adjustments?
If you need to file in multiple states, file a 1099 (self employed), or a lot of other common but not typical situations they‚Äôll make you pay to do those parts with them. One year I made money in different states, had made a couple thousand through self employed gigs, and pulled some investment money without even thinking about the tax implications‚Ä¶

Turbo tax took like half my refund that year. But the next year I tried myself with a similar situation and my taxes got delayed‚Ä¶ it took 403 days to receive my refund.
They don‚Äôt teach anything in public schools.

Edit: teach yourself.
Turbo tax practically does it for you.
Not WebMB, no. Last time I had to self diagnose I actually used NHS.uk 

Edit: I did get a degree in accounting after getting ripped off by HR Block for a cpl years though.
Haha exactly
So you would still be responsible for taxes due if they made errors but if it was negligent on their part then they would be responsible.
In the US it matches federal income tax for anything held less than a year, and is taxed as capital gains tax for anything held more than a year.
No idea. Just not available for withdrawal. Maybe because I got it for signing up and you got yours under a different promotion? I didn't bother looking into it because it's $5 and I was just messing around.
I was thinking that there would be people thinking the same thing. Glad I was not wrong.

It's really sad. My parents went there in the 60's/70's and I remember the late 90's being awesome!! I loved visiting. It just feels like another big city infested by yuppies now.....instagraming they're in Austin like it's still small and weird. Maybe Buda or Dripping Springs can be the old Austin, lol.
Funny you mention that analogy. I thought the same thing...no leveling up lol. It would be better than worrying about money 24/7. I would still work and be productive, benefiting society in some way, you know? That would make me happy.
Magic numbers are the classic example. Don't use constants set mid code unless it's actually needed. If you think it's needed, it's probably not. Use configs files and dependency injection to manage your defaults. If you do actually need constants, make sure they're well documented about what they are, what they're for, and that they're not mid code with no context. You shouldn't look at a value and think, ""What the fuck is this"" or ""How the fuck do I change this from somewhere else"".

Premature optimization is one of the biggest ones. Chances are you're going to be wrong about what runs slow, and will end up overcomplicating things. You might also be wrong about what *can* make something run faster and your ""optimizations"" can slow things down. If you want to optimize, wait until it slows down and run benchmarks to find out what's actually doing it. Otherwise, if it's not actually running slow, it's much better to keep it simple and maintainable. Always measure before you optimize.

Bikeshedding and Over-analysis. Spending so much time trying to figure thing out the absolute best solution instead of just doing something. Don't spend all your time in planning. Follow SOLID, keep it simple, and make it work first. This doesn't mean write bad code to get the job done ASAP. As long as you write good code it doesn't need to be the perfect solution since good code can be easily changed later. Perfection is the enemy of good enough.

I think these four are the biggest ones that I see happening the most often that cause the most issues. There are an absolute truck load of anti-patterns though, and [the wiki page has a good list of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern#Software_engineering)


My favorite is the [Singleton](https://www.michaelsafyan.com/tech/design/patterns/singleton), because I see it fucking *everywhere*.
Anytime you assume someone will do something the correct way because ""it's just obvious."" 


It's like the Family guy free boat sketch. People fuck up the most simple task so with programming you can't let them have that option.
In C#/Java, overuse of static is a big one.  It's much harder to test your code if your static methods communicate with dependencies, for example.
Another one is making things too parallel. General design pattern is that parallelism is good. But if there are too many threads, each thread does too little of the work and each has a start up cost. Then the threads need to combine the results and also have to worry about contention. It ends up being better to do the processing in a single thread.  It doesn‚Äôt apply all the time obviously, but is an anti pattern because the general assumption is that parallelism is always good.
I'm curious. Do you think of yourself as unlucky?

Exactly. I'm fine with telling anybody I'm having a conversation with how much I make an hour at my job. But I'm not going to tell them how much I have in my bank account, or how much is in my crypto wallet.

Talking finances and budgets and wages is much different from telling them how much I have of everything.
> and the latter does nothing except cause resentment

And also tipping them off about a good investment so they can do the same and make money too
Completely agree with this. My family has had situations where other family members start expecting us to pay for them after finding out how much we make. These days I literally just tell people ‚Äúit‚Äôs none of your business.‚Äù
Yeah democratic ownership of the workplace is the only rational scenario tbh
I mean, if you compare the US to third world countries it‚Äôs worse. Most other developed countries have much better workers rights than the US. The US is average to back of the pack in most standard of living metrics too.

Not saying it‚Äôs a bad place to live, it‚Äôs just not top tier if you‚Äôre going by the data.
>Most wealthy people

I think part of this fear is it's not ""wealthy"" people worried about it, it's people that have been struggling their entire life and make some lucky investments and suddenly appear wealthy compared to their previous position/peers.
My tin foil hat hasn‚Äôt failed me yet.
Everyone‚Äôs friends are nice, until they‚Äôre not.
Just as a thought experiment, how does it benefit me to reveal how much I make to my coworkers if I suspect that I make more than them? How does it benefit me to reveal that information to friends, or a potential partner? I've heard and witnessed too many horror stories of drama that result in such disclosure, so I would be interested in hearing what the upsides may be.
It‚Äôs also illegal
With 10 million you might even CAUSE the peak

Ok. Someone give this guy 10m and lets see this through
Too easy. No one fucks with Birdman.
There is now, and you‚Äôre on it!
Sounds great to me, dude!
I remember my dad showed me how much I‚Äôd have if I saved $100 a month from 20-30 years old then just let it accrue interest. Then he showed me what I‚Äôd have if I saved $100 a month from 30 to retirement. That really opened my eyes. Everyone should learn that lesson.
20‚Äôs are for learning and 30‚Äôs for earning. I blew my money in 20‚Äôs and like you it‚Äôs now difficult to waste money. I‚Äôd much rather buy some crypto that than fast food meal.
Thats my story too, I used to spend more money when I was broke.
Hey, honest question here, you have the anonymity of the internet. Do you tip delivery people, restaurant waiters etc. Now that you are more frugal? Did the amount you tip change?
It will my man. It took awhile to get to 10k because I was making dogshit/hr in NYC but compound interest and dividends are friends to everyone. $5 dividends turn into $25 dividends then into $100 dividends. Also I realize I‚Äôm in a crypto subreddit, this applies more to traditional financial practices. I‚Äôm only here because I‚Äôm starting out, I don‚Äôt know how to cryptwalk.
I will vouch for the jist of his statement. Made almost all of my net worth in stocks, I would say though first 100k is the hardest. It‚Äôs a runaway snowball after that if you‚Äôve made sound investment choices( I do not consider crypto a sound investment choice ü§£)

I got quite lucky investing in this 11 year bull run but the best money you will make is slow money.
Without getting too personal, I just mean that 10k turns into 20k a LOT faster than 0-10k. Then the 20k turns into 30k even faster. It‚Äôs a snowball effect but that first 10k is slow, tedious, and seemingly stagnant. I have decades to look forward to and the momentum to reach 100k, I just didn‚Äôt want to come off as humble bragging to the other guy.
It‚Äôs feasible. Not necessarily probable at this point in the bull run but I‚Äôd say you have an outside shot at 100k.
I think it‚Äôs going to be a good year. Etc is a better coin then doge according to most and I made all my money on doge lol. If I hadn‚Äôt paper handed early on I‚Äôd be at 76,000 right now
As someone also living in a country with near-free healthcare this is really sad indeed.. America seems like one of the best countries to live in the world, if you're rich. If you're not rich you're better off in any other first-world country

Even so, your 500k valuation at the top of a bull market may be ok, but in a bear market when it's worth 70% less, you're not getting 50k, or even 32k a year on interest, no where near,  just 15k in fact, (if you can get 10% interest), so what then? Sell some of your stock to get you back to your 50k requirement? Leaves you just 135k to earn interest on, so 13.5k per year interest, sell some more to make up your shortfall....

500k may knock some years off your working life, but it's not enough to stop working and live on if you want 50k per year, or even just 32k per year.
Issue is when you end up needing more money, you maybe not be able to work. Whether or not you‚Äôre still capable of or whether or not you have the skills to do so. 

This is why retirement completely removes that element from the equation. Imagine retiring for 20 years just renter the workforce because you did an oppsie on your math.
>don‚Äôt mind making sacrifices

That‚Äôs the difference between you and me. If I plan to retire, I won‚Äôt be making sacrifices. Retirement means, I‚Äôm done. I live the lifestyle all while not having to work. I don‚Äôt have to fret about increased housing or anything else. I have so much fuck you money that it doesn‚Äôt bother me if social security evaporated over night. 

That‚Äôs the definition of retirement to me. Anything else is sub standard.
What does the last sentence mean lol
Your aims are too low. Aim higher. Don‚Äôt aim to live decent. Aim to live like a baller
With the current housing climate, how many 20-30 something year olds actually own houses?

Your argument may have held true 5-10 years ago, but it‚Äôs actually something worth factoring in now.

With *theoretical* fundamentals. None of these lofty ""we're going to solve world hunger with our new cryptocoin!"" things are *actually* doing what they claim to. Their ""fundamentals"" are still all entirely hypothetical. They're only mildly more ""real"" than doge is.
I am also one of the people who put $20 in coins and let me tell you, it was a 'shitcoin' that gave me more than all my other coins with fundamentals
Yeah, OK. Go back to 2018 and tell that to everyone who lost out big gambling on Bitcoin, or '99 on tech in the stock market, or in '08 in real estate. All ""investments"" are a gamble. Some of the best technology and businesses with sound principles go BK or miss the mark due to many factors. If you want safe and boring, put your money in a bank to earn .0125% or where in some countries you get charged to have savings over a certain amount. 

&#x200B;

PS: If Doge was a 'scam meme coin' it has sure beat the odds having been around for 8 years now and beating every single haters expectations. Keep on hating. It just feeds the Doge ;) Good luck to you.
Invest in what you love, like, believe in, whatever. But you can do that without hating on other coins you don't understand. Ruth's Chris Steakhouse is much better than McDonald's yes? No comparison in where you will get a better meal. But which one is more popular and has more success? It's not always about the best sizzle or the best substance. Sometimes businesses and investments pay off simply because of the hype and ease of use and lower entry level access. Doge ain't going anywhere. Even if it dips after tonight or tomorrow, it will still be around and be higher than most on this sub or anywhere expected it to ever reach. Deal with that fact and you may be happier in your own investments and happy for those who love their Doge. GL in to you and yours.
Exactly, when everyone wants to sell that causes a massive drop in price because suddenly no one wants to buy with everyone desperate to sell. So trades won‚Äôt execute without a buyer and if unlucky you become the ultimate bag holder.
Well that's when prices drop and things crash I assume.
Someone else already answered this, but yes. It'd indeed mean that sales would stagnate if nobody wants to buy whatever people are selling.

If everyone tries to sell and nobody buys, then those selling will be unable to do so until they lower their asking price to a level where there are buyers willing to trade with them.

The dropping of a price is caused by sellers outnumbering buyers, forcing people to sell for a lower price so they can attract buyers. 

To put this into perspective: you are free to sell your BTC at 1.000.000 USD right now. But you'll quickly find that nobody is willing to pay that much. Your trade will just linger around in the order book looking for a buyer. Nobody in their right mind would pay this much, so you're forced to drop your price all the way down to like 50k or whatever the price currently is in order to sell to a buyer.

The ultimate worst case scenario is what happens with the so-called ""shitcoins"". Everything is fun and games until literally wants to buy your coins anymore. These people are the ones we call ""bag holders"". They have this bag of useless coins they hold, but can't sell to anyone since nobody is willing to buy.

In 2018 the market crashed and lots of projects turned into worthless coins. The exchanges would delist them and sometimes even the chains were shut-down. If you didn't sell your coins before all that, you'll be a bag holder since there's nobody left to sell it to.
I mean, that's the exact same thing. You sell your coin for BTC, which implies that someone else bought it.
The middle man always win.
It is. You just got to sell at higher price before the 'music' ends. Ideally, you sell while it is going up (cause it's hard to time the top) while encouraging everyone else to keep hodling/buying.
More like a ponzi scheme.  A giant decentralized ponzi scheme.
No Kenny it‚Äôs bewbs
That‚Äôs smart
Hmm interesting... Seems gameable in many ways with the right amount of planning and cash.
bro read the post again, he literally said doge‚Äôs tech was constructed so that doge will always produce more of itself with no end in sight, whereas there‚Äôs an actual cap to other coins
Just because something is an investment asset and not a currency (which is what crypto currently is primarily) it doesn't make it a pseudo-ponzi scheme. You could make an argument for something like gold being a Ponzi scheme if you continued that logic. There is quite a substantial difference between something like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. In the next 20 years the amount of Bitcoin available will max out at about 15% of the current amount in circulation, after this that quantity will stay consistent. 

Compare that to Dogecoin where the amount will double in quantity in the next 20 years and continue to rise after that. That means for the value of a Doge investment to retain its initial value its market cap has to continuously rise (i.e demand needs to rise), but for bitcoin for an investment to retain value its market cap just has to stay the same.

The fact that for it to maintain its value it has to constantly increase demand means that it's comparable to a ponzi-scheme in that it needs 'new investors' to retain value. Bitcoin does not need that hence why it is not comparable. That's not to say that something like Bitcoin isn't a volatile asset that is a bubble that can eventually burst, but that doesn't make it a ponzi-scheme just like how overpriced tech companies in the dot-com bubble weren't Ponzi-schemes.
My god, too many illiterates on here.
You missed the part about there being a limit to the amount of Bitcoin that can ever exist (I think that number is around 21 million bitcoin).  Dogecoin doesn't have an upper limit, therefore supply can keep increasing indefinitely.  That can't happen for most coins because an upper limit is built into the coin.
Yeah, I don't try to get in the habit of telling other people what to do with their money, but I'm gonna guess that a grand is pretty big investment for my buddy. I tried to suggest he at least take out his initial stake so he can't lose any money on this deal.
Yo man my perception is my reality. Dump your money in doge, idgaf.
you mean and encourage him to stick with it for 5 years like he planned?
i may be talking out of my ass here as i'm not a developer so don't take this as facts, but the way i understand it, you can't really change things, only build on top of it (which seems like a safe and logical way to do things). so for a cap and to end minting, you would probably need to migrate it to a new platform.
Thanks, I'm definitely doing better now. That all went down at a time where I wasn't being healthy in other aspects either; staying inside all day, not communicating with friends, etc. Now I'm working again which requires socializing and being outside all day long (plus gives a temporary sense of purpose, lol) and I think that's the only reason I'm feeling comfortable dipping back in to crypto again. 

As far as doge goes, you're totally right. I certainly don't know enough to predict with any real confidence what's going to happen, and any words of warning I give could end up wrong just as well as they could end up right. He's a good dude, and I really hope it turns out well for him, but it was hard seeing him stress so much over it and knowing what that feeling is like. Lol, especially when I'm busting my ass trying to finish up my job before we go into OT. (He's our driver, so it's not like he was slacking when he should have been working or anything, but it did get a little grating)

I suppose how much I agree with that depends on how much an authority the person giving advice is on whatever subject they are talking about. If a group Of well respected doctors gives incredibly bad medical advice and people are hurt because of it, then I‚Äôm more inclined to agree with you. But if an average redditor says to invest in some memecoin, and other redditors take their advice and lose their shorts, I‚Äôm less sympathetic.
And when safemooncash gets listed on its first exchange it's going to blow up even more. You're crazy not to throw a couple hundred at it in this bull run.
 Yes - I am joking üôÉ
It‚Äôs an option $10 then you leverage your investment heavily by choosing this.
Dude tell me about it I‚Äôm in the effing twilight zone with those MF‚Äôs also!! Lol I‚Äôve had SO many discrepancies on fees before they just have so many variables lol. Theoretically you only REALLY see a price break when you are trading a million dollar per month or better. Believe it or not when I called them out about over charging me on fees I was sent the name and address of their registered agent and told I could sue them.
I‚Äôm not sure which part confused you but here is a link to Coinbase pro fee tiers. Hope this helps. [Tiered Pricing on Coinbase Pro](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/trading-and-funding/trading-rules-and-fees/fees)
As you can see if you aren‚Äôt doing 300mill+ of trading with them monthly - you have to remember that is compiled monthly then you won‚Äôt see reasonable fees. However I‚Äôm not sure how into crypto you are but you can utilize things like liquidity pools and flash loans to add significant leverage to your trades without collateral so you can get pretty close to these numbers as an average investor without actually having that much leverage. Sometimes opportunities present but you need a bot and it‚Äôs got to be FAAAAAST and you have to be willing to sacrifice some profit to have your transaction frontrun! Or know someone who runs nodes and can process your transaction immediately so no mem pools anywhere.
Or if you BIIIIIIITCONNNNECTTTT!
If that's the prostitute's name I think it's a business right off.
I like
The real scary part of it is that Dogecoin has a cap, it was built as a meme currency and so isn't sustainable. I'm sure it'll last well into a dollar, but past that nobody can see the cliff edge. Hell nobody can see the cliff's edge before a dollar so it might crash earlier.
You seem severely skeptical

This is the way! If you want to be audited.
There's a lot of free tax filing tools. I can't remember which one I used to do mine (had a lot of stocks/crypto trades I had to account for so I couldn't use TurboTax free), but there's a really good Patriot Act episode on it
You can, you just have to click on the correct ‚Äúfree‚Äù link.
If you made below $72,000 you can still do free TurboTax through IRS [free file](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free).

No matter how complex your tax situation. None of the tax software companies seem to mention this program.

EDIT: less than $39,000 for TurboTax, $72,000 for some other various tax software.
I used the auto import from Robinhood fine, you just gotta use the real unrestricted Free File version of TurboTax (AGI has to be < $39K though).

Credit karma is free. I compare both turbo tax and credit karma results for 2 years now and they were both the same exact amount.
Why?
Why would that be the case?
true story: I have found a pirated copy of TurboTax

although I‚Äôve never actually used it to file taxes and I‚Äôd probably do it on a machine not connected to the internet
Someone downvoted you but it‚Äôs true. I didn‚Äôt need to pay to use TurboTax til I bought a house and my itemized deductions started totaling more than the standard.
Actually it turns out turbo tax is free for all income levels. This comment didn‚Äôt add anything to the discussion.
It‚Äôs free for all income levels. If you own a business or have rental properties then it will cost you 60-120$
I haven‚Äôt gotten hardly any emails from them recently at least. Probably toned it back

Everyone loses money for a few years when they start trading. Keep your chin up, learn from your mistakes and dont treat it like a casino! Do your research and have the constitution to see your positions through to close. 

You'll get the hang of it.
Great list of them. Lots of developers try to optimize even when there isn‚Äôt even a problem. That‚Äôs why the MVP model still works well. Get it in front of the customer, see if there is something wrong with it, before spending time optimizing.
Wow bro you just enlightened me to my own mistakes.  Im talking about CNC machining but your explanations of premature optimization and over analysis really clicked.  Ive done this for years.
Excellent!  We had two big projects going. The philosophy I used was when we hit a really hard big decision between two options, we chose one and went on.  The reason it was hard to choose was both were good choices. The other project reported weeks on end of how they were settling on a decision. We shipped and made a ton of money. The other project was still in process when I left.
I struggle with the over-analysis. It bugs me if I don't come up with a solution that looks really nice to me, or if the first solution that comes to my head seems really ugly, when I know there has got to be a better way to do it.
This guy wrote a book on them and did a lecture series. The leprechauns of software development.

Beauty of being paranoid: no one will ever get one over on you.
First, if I tell my peers what I am making, they realize they have some negotiation room. If they have higher salaries, they are less likely to leave, which reduces the amount of times I need to cover for turnover among staff.

Second, I'm a top performer at my company. When my peers creep closer to my salary, or I work to get them promoted, I have a lever to pull to say ""there is an inequity in my salary/position compared to my performance amongst my peers."" 

Rinse, repeat. It's had mixed results and there is more nuance, but it's helped.
That's the exact issue. If your coworkers are doing the same job as you then they should all be around the same pay level.  

For you it doesn't have any benefits which is exactly why employers do that. Now you wont say shit and make sure that efforts to organize fall on deaf ears because of the horror stories you've heard.  

If you weren't making more of all your coworkers you wouldn't be so afraid to share with them.

Has anybody ever told you that you look like Tony Hawk?
So, like, 12K? Not that much saved by 30 tbh. Let's say you work 40 more years after that. Another 48K?  


More money than I've ever had, don't get me wrong, but nothing you can retire on...
you are missing a big factor, inflation. by the time you retire that money will have a lower value. if say you saved 60k and retired in the 90s, that 60k is worth 30k today in purchasing power...
I actually spent most of my 20s working in restaurants, so when it comes to tipping thats an area I am more generous with now that I have a little more money.  I know how much just an extra $5 or so can make someone's mood a little brighter, so I tend to tip pretty generously.  Especially since I know a lot of folks working in the restaurant industry have had a rough past year due to covid.
I stopped ordering delivery (even picking up is so much cheaper than delivery) and eating out in general. The few times I do I tip generously.
[deleted]
Yeah its feasible, just everything will have to align nicely for me, depends a bit on luck in my choices and the way the market decides to go. I made alot on etc, and tbh I went back in today at $115 because eth popped up $300 into 3800+ now. It's a total gamble, I know etc is a shitcoin but worth the risk in this short term if it's going to make me alot. Besides I can re-invest my gains into cartesi if I make some decent profits today or tomorrow off etc. I've been doing really well on cartesi though, and I'll longterm hold that while I make riskier bets when the market pumps and dumps and hopefully keep putting money into both cartesi and ETH, my 2 biggest bags.
Oh I feel you on that my friend. I sold my etc way before the top I was astounded that it got to 174.. lol I felt like a paper handed bitch selling in the 110s. Ngl, after today I got back in because eth went to 3800+, just banking on the fact that etc could go to 200 or some crazy shit, since it just reacts to eth. Maybe that makes me insane. But I guess fuck it at this point, gonna risk it to make that $$$

You know what is worse than sub par free healthcare? Not being able to afford *any* healthcare.  

In America you are taught by example from a very early age to just ignore lots and lots and lots of pains and warning signs because shit is going to cost you.  

Hell I had a very bad rash breaking out on my hands and going into the dermatologist they wanted to test for a staph infection. Ok sure better be safe than sorry... btw that test is gonna cost you $100.   

So 2 visits and 2 negative staph tests later (and yes $200 down the tubes) my 3rd time they went to test and I straight up said fuck no. I'll take the risk of infection because I can not afford another $100 for the test.
It wasn‚Äôt meant as a personal attack. I just thought the idea of people toting huge gains was kind of funny. More so the idea that they might be taking them somewhere to hide them.

He‚Äôs not. I‚Äôve seen math like his before and it doesn‚Äôt account inflation or higher cost of living throughout the years.
2.5%
At 500k I'd plan to liquidate most of my crypto portfolio and diversify back into ETFs and real estate. There's no way I'd accept a meager 10% annual appreciation left in a high risk asset like crypto.

Yeah I aim pretty high. I'm normally not very risk-averse but something about the market's got the hairs on my neck standing up. Otherwise I'd be greedy and diving in to high yield shit.
I don‚Äôt disagree, and like I said, your point about being conservative because the cost of living always increases is spot-on, but if you do own a home and have paid it off 65k/year is pretty nice. You could even travel internationally a couple of times a year, eat out a few times a week, and just in general live large and still come in under that 65k year. If you wanna bang coked up supermodels on a yacht you‚Äôll need way more, but for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù luxurious living 65k/year is enough once you‚Äôve eliminated the major bills of housing/childcare.
most likely because you are African

Remind me in a year then.
There are real coins being used for real utility today. This is undeniable fact that even a small amout of research will prove. In addition fundamentals goes beyond immediate utility. Don't confuse utility with fundamentals.
$20 is one thing, but what about $2,000 or $20,000? There is some factor of scale there. I'll put $200 into a coin I am learning about, just get some skin in the game. But $20 isn't investing, or at least not seriously.

Sometimes gambling on a shitcoin pays. Some shitcoins have great fundamentals and really shouldn't be called shitcoins. DOGE is not one of those coins. It is a rip off clone of Bitcoin that has no development. Literally abandoned by its creators. It has no fundamentals, just branding and memeing.

Investing isn't about gambling on coins we know are trash. I'm up over 30x YOY on some of my buys on solid coins I invested in based on fundamentals and utility. I never bought a coin without fundamentals or gambled on a bullshit meme coin. The whole DOGE coin thing is a dangerous sham. Invest in real projects instead and you will win in the long term.
Gambling is not investing. DOGE is an abandoned scam coin and clone with no roadmap, no development, no end game. A scam for people too lazy or dumb to learn before they buy.
It doesn‚Äôt concern you that people are only investing into DOGE in the hopes that someone will name drop it in an SNL skit which will somehow send it to the moon. As if it isn‚Äôt up 212k% already
Anyone who has ever longed into Kucoin should immediately recognize just how much it looks like a casino.

In the US whenever your gains are realized (you receive real world value) its a taxable event on whatever the value of the transaction was. So if you trade Bitcoin for ethereum, you're supposed to pay taxes on whatever the value of the transaction was at the time.

You can avoid this though by using decentalized exchanges, but you'd also be dodging taxes.

The difference between gold and dogecoin is that gold ultimately has some marginal uses such as jewelry, some industrial processes and most of all is used as collateral for backing certain large international transactions between financial institutions and countries.
Then you missed my point. My point was, do people invest in Bitcoin because they think Bitcoin is the future currency and want to support it or because they think they'd earn money when they sell it later at higher price. I didn't talk about the stability of the two coins.
Correct, it is your reality. Just don't pawn it off as some profound revelation as if you know anything. You have legitimately nothing to add to the conversation other than your own bias.

You're a fool, and I hope you have a wonderful weekend.
Well if he's lecturing your on market caps etc and you say he finally gets it, there's no way he'd leave it in for 5 years. Especially if he's sitting on a couple of mil right now. There's no holder/diamond hand in the world that will not sell when it hits $2m+ I don't care who you are.
I mean the obvious manipulation that can be seen in the chart proves it imo but we'll see.

Isn‚Äôt that very risky ?
So the max variable fee on Pro is 0.5%, while the variable fee on the regular version is 1.49% and on top of that there is a margin fee of up to 2% (of something) on the normal version that you won‚Äôt get on Pro if you place a limit order. The normal version only does market orders.
I‚Äôm not sure what you are comparing CB Pro to. If comparing to usual CB, fees on Pro are much better in any case.

If comparing to Kucoin, then yes, Kucoin has better fees than Pro.

If comparing to No fees, then sure. Nothing is better than no fees

As someone who is currently free-lancing and pretty much running a project on its own, analysis is ok before starting,then you need to start doing something and try to implement it and usually you will discover something that you couldn't didn't think of in the analysis phase (if it's a new problem you are tackling).
I used to dismiss solutions that would take a lot of code to write. Sometimes spending days before writing something to make sure I can write it with a minimal amount of typing.

What a silly reason to procrastinate.

Understood, but this didn't exactly address the ""benefits"" part.  

For reference, I work as an independent consultant and though I know my employer has many consultants, I am the one with the longest contract, the most experience, and the most specialized client services, and furthermore I don't even know who my ""coworkers"" are except for the few occasions when I am brought in to fix their work. This is all to clarify why I posted this as a thought experiment, wasn't trying to be snooty or anything :)

You‚Äôre missing the most important factor. Compound interest.
Person A saves 12k/year for 10 years and stops contributing at age 32. 

Assume 7% returns from the market.

Person A will have 138k at 30 years old 

At age 62 they'd have 1,050,000 or so

Person B saves 12k a year from 32 to 62

At age 62 they'd have 1,133,529

The difference being person A only invested 120k while person B invested 360k
This has nothing to do with compound interest. This is not a lesson on inflation. Why does this sub have such a hard on for inflation?
Which is why you invest. Crypto aside just putting it on the s&p500 (SPY) means you get 7% APR on average *after inflation.*

Inflation isn't even an issue if you invest every penny. If you retired in the 90s and didn't have all of your savings invested, then you're a complete idiot.
All I did was make a roboadvisor account with Wealthfront for a Roth IRA. Contributed 10-20% of every paycheck, bonus, unexpected income ever. The returns have been good and steady and it does all the work of picking stocks and ETFs. I tried picking stocks years ago and got burned so I went the safe and boring route. If not Wealthfront, Betterment and Vanguard also have great roboadvisor options. That‚Äôs all I did and it really paid off because I am definitely not a finance guy.
My recommendation would be to shuffle some profits from the so called ‚Äúshitcoins‚Äù into the blue chip cryptos . Every time one of my alt-coins doubles in value i take 10-20 % and move it back into btc and eth.  This way I always have a bag if the price keeps going up. Cartesi is very low cap at the moment so it certainly wouldn‚Äôt be crazy to see it 10x to a 10billion dollar cap during a bull market.
Cheers
It is slow and steady. Going full ham is great if you hit lucky but not a lot of those. I started with ~$1500 back in 2016 and have slowly worked my way up to mid 6-figures, mostly through long term holds and diversification. Sometimes you make a lucky trade, sometimes you buy something that seems promising and wait for the project to mature.

Just gotta disconnect yourself from the day to day price and enjoy the ride. Memecoins are for low entry-quick flipping. Projects with fundamentals capable of unrooting entrenched structures are for long term holds and staking divs. No different then playing penny stocks to flip profits into blue chips for dividend earnings.
:( Not cool either...
Oh, that's bad. Not only is inflation expected, but it's planned. The Federal Reserve sets an inflation target of 2% every year. They plan to create inflation.
>as if it‚Äôs that simple 

Not with that attitude
Especially in 3rd world countries people make life by shitposting.
It‚Äôs not looking good so far üò±

Please I suck ur d man
No u
lol, ok. The roadmap has always been the same with Doge; to be the people currency. Also, if it was abandoned, how come it has new utility and acceptance as a currency by major business and small mom and pop stores too. Doge is still being mined, and there are developers working on it. Need to read up on Doge more than just this sub with the fellow haters. Do your own research and apply some critical thought to it. /
No it doesn't concern me. Doge has continued to beat every supposed limit there was on the coin; .01, .10, .25. 50 etc. It will continue to do that with or without Elon or Mark as the community is huge now AND there is more and more actual utility as a currency now.  That's my belief. Who knows what will happen, but I don't personally feel Doge is going to 'fail' or go back to sub .10 as many on here predict. It may stabilize around .50 or so, but it will eventually reach a $1.00 and maybe a bit higher IMHO. I think because Musk is polarizing due to his business methods and tactics, it upsets some more about Doge than so than the whole 'meme coin' thing. I personally don't care about Musk. I believe in this coin and it's purpose as an everyday coin that can be used as a currency. We'll see.
Fully agree with you. Encourage long-term investment over swing speculation.
Yeah exactly, the thing a lot of new people are missing out on is that 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE and that‚Äôs all it was ever supposed to be.
I wasn't talking about stability either.  If you can't see the difference, there's no hope in explaining it to you.  

But to answer your question, yes, a lot of bitcoin investors don't plan to ever sell because the expectation is that it will continue to increase in value indefinitely.
Tell me how doge isn't a scam and has value beyond it's flavor of the minute hype. What is it useful for? What problem does it solve?
he pulled out to cover his investment after i linked the post, but is still hodling the rest. fully expecting it to hit $10+ now (more realistic than his earlier expectations or $100 by december lol).

doge has been going up nearly every week since late last year and his arrogant ass has used the upwards trend as proof of argument that it will hit the same value per coin as bitcoin in 5 years; not at all understanding marketcap, supply, and tokenomics of doge - and instead arguing that it will be the no. 1 coin because elon, and because some stores now accept doge (not understanding the transaction limitations of doge).

but yeah my point was that most people seem to approach crypto the same way as him; else i see little reason for all these serious projects to essentially not move since february while so many shitcoins are exploding. doge is just one of many such and an easy example.

logically, if you want to make good gains on investments, wouldn‚Äôt the smartest move be to invest in a technology that has the highest chance of consistent growth? i mean, instead of dead, meme, scam, etc. coin? but apparently the average crypto investor wholly disagrees with that sentiment.

It‚Äôs refreshing to just have a good debate, it‚Äôs been nice bantering with ya. I think we‚Äôre pretty much on the same page now. If it‚Äôs some post with 30k upvotes, and some solid looking DD; yeah people are probably going to put some responsibility on that poster if they fuck up, regardless if he deserved it or not haha. I just hope someday I don‚Äôt post some thought out DD that just turns out to be popular and accidentally incredibly wrong at the same time, that would be my luck!
Yes and stupid
That‚Äôs all still too high if you are trading. As a trader if you are specifically utilizing smart contract flash loans to leverage your trade, and your trade will be temporary- then having physical custody of the crypto shouldn‚Äôt be an issue and you should be trading on exchanges with volume, and no fees such as Robinhood or PayPal. 

Now I‚Äôm not saying I agree with the politics of those two but I do agree with no fees on a quick trade. You are working your ass off to do the quantitative level technical analysis- .50 is still way to freaking high considering these exchanges actually do nothing at all but take your money, and there are plenty of automated markets with liquidity pools and potentially lower fees also. 

I‚Äôm mostly just making a point that to get exceptional rates on CB pro you‚Äôve really gotta be using some leverage. Both of them are ridiculous and oddly enough there are a few trades I can make on Coinbase that actually have lower fees even with leverage than on CB pro. Their whole system is garbage if you want my honest opinion lol.
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey!
I've definitely met her, and her profits were far better than any returns you will ever get from crypto.
There is a very specific form you file for cap gains
Expound on this please
Weve been conditioned by false advertising
I've been using them for several years now.  They're great!
If they threw safe and moon into the name it would sound much less like a scam.
I've used them for at least 8 years. Simple and easy. They ask for about $8 to file your state taxes which is well worth it because I can do my taxes for my employer and the three businesses that I make a little from in a little over an hour. Also I received my stimulus checks quickly because I use them
Legit the second I read that url I was thinking ""that sounds like a scam"" and then I read the rest of your comment lol
I used it this year. Worked great! Didn't try to charge me for 1099 work like TurboTax does
Because our parents keep saying nothing in life is free.
I e used this for the last 3 years and am yet to be disappointed, they even keep up with sending you emails about the various stimulus checks and other things to watch for that are related / tied-to your taxes
Used them for years, sounds like a scam but is actually amazing.
Only if u make under a certain amount
I'll second Credit Karma. I used H&R Block up until I bought a house, and then suddenly it was, ""Oh nooo! Dat's too hawd to do wiffout gibbing us money pwease...""

Hopped over to Credit Karma, and not only was it free for everything I needed, both state and federal, but their UI/UX design is way better.
Man I'm jealous haha. It took me like 6+ hours to do mine

It was an acquisition of Intuit's just this year around November. More integration is being planned throughout this year, but just a bit of linkage was put into place between the two to pump those numbers this tax season.
Shit... good to know thanks
Could you put the info in yourself though?
There‚Äôs the well known TT Free edition that‚Äôs super limited and filled with up sells and then the hidden IRS Free File edition that‚Äôs full featured but limited to AGIs under $39K.

https://freefile.intuit.com
Maybe they didn‚Äôt teach you anything in the 60s and 70s, but nowadays public schools are quite fulfilling.
You're advocating that people do their own taxes and then you say public schools don't teach you anything. Who taught you basic math and the ability to write those thoughts? You think somebody without any basic education would be able to file their own taxes?

They wouldn't even know how to structure their Google query.
Pretty sure you need to document all crypto transactions of trading or selling in your taxes anyways or risk paying taxes on the full amount of crypto rather than just the profit, if you can‚Äôt document it when getting audited.
So you live your life on anecdotes and emotions. 

Why wouldn‚Äôt you want to live a life with the most factual information available to you? That way we know what can be improved. They aren‚Äôt articles my friend, they are verifiable facts. An article implies opinion. The ultimate showing of loving your country is improving it and making the lives of its citizens better.

You having a decent life =\= it being the best place to live. That‚Äôs the view of someone living life with the blinders on.
How much would person B have to invest per year to catch up to person A so they could then stop investing and have the same overall investment for the same overall outcome? Obviously the best time to start saving was 10 years ago, but can‚Äôt you ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù if you save more per year even if you start later and end up having less time overall?
I just moved my Roth IRA from Betterment to Fidelity. Roboinvestors are really nice but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really worth it for tax-advantaged accounts. The main benefit is tax loss harvesting which is only possible in a taxable account. I‚Äôm about 80/20 FZROX/FZILX and it‚Äôs 100% fee free.
Agree, I think that's a smart idea. Hopefully I can stick to everything well enough, and make some great gains in the coming years! I think after all the reading, I'm on board for cartesi and hope to see it grow and be here with this community

Cheers and goodluck to you friend

They say 2% but I plan 3%. Market has been doing 10% on average over 100 years so 10% - 3% = 7%.

However you can‚Äôt expect 7% returns if your original invested amount is needed to be consistent for your returns. So you‚Äôre not really invested 100% in stock, more so a mixture of medium and low risk assets. You that 7% is actually much lowered when realized. More so like 4-3%. I use the 3% number to air on the side of caution.

I want 100k to retire per year. 3.5 mill x 3% = 100k.

That‚Äôs assuming cost of living doesn‚Äôt outpace inflation. As we know this isn‚Äôt always true. 

My 3.5 million number isn‚Äôt all that far fetched. It has conservative returns built in for inflation, bear years, as well as increase of cost of living. 

I didn‚Äôt just pull it out of my ass.
[deleted]
I guess crypto is saving humanity then ;)
Oh i see, thanks
Yeah, it is abandoned in that it has no development, no roadmap, no goal.
Good to hear your opinion but I will never be on board. In my eyes everyone has been playing hot potato the last almost 5 months. Long term this coin is completely unsustainable at any high price, that‚Äôs my opinion and I chose not to invest because I don‚Äôt know when the collapse will happen.
I don't see how it can stabilize that high with amount of new coins minted every day. I give it a few years tops before it's sub 10 cents. Just my two cents tho
I see it completely different. Everyone that I know who is involved in crypto, don't care about the fundamentals or the technology of a coin/token. They select their investments based off the % gains. 

If I really love the tech and application of a coin/token but I see that it's gone down 30% in the past 12 months, and has slow movement, I'm not going to invest as my money would have better returns elsewhere.

If I understand the power and momentum of what hype can do, I'll invest in the project that has the most hype coverage surrounding it, because hype always makes money. And that's what A LOT of people use as their investment strategy and can make a lot of money from doing so.

The fact that I've been holding ETH for 4 years, but I've made over 50x more money off a coin called CumRocket in the last 6 weeks proves this. 

Buy the rumour, sell the news. Hype is an incredible tool to make a lot of money if you know how to do it.
Can I have the link you gave him? I wanna know more about this. I just dumped about 60‚Ç¨ on doge the other day, not as a serious investment but cause I had some to spare so I thought why not but now I'm interested in all this
No but the stock rising, stopping at EXACTLY 180.00 many times in a row, falling a lot when there is barely any volume and being shorted so much are all signs it's manipulated.
Do you think day and swing trading can pay as much or more than buy and hold , and sort of be like having a job ?
""Profits"" are far better than my return from crypto. I need some Charity in my life
For capital gains tax though. Which means the asset was held over a year.
surveillance marketing.
They would've done great in the 90s.
freesafemoontaxusa
And all of the comments saying otherwise sound like bottled testimonials. I don't know what to believe anymore.
I‚Äôve used them for 10 years now.  Free federal and state is like $11 or so with a coupon code.  I recommend them every time taxes come up and every time I add ‚ÄúYes I know the name sounds like a scammer website but they are legit, I found them originally on the IRS website list of approved e-file websites.‚Äù
arent credit karma and turbo tax owned by the same company?
Does it do crypto tax
Really sounds like a scam by those tax filing companies, wonder how much they 'dontate' to Congress to keep the system that way.
yeah inuit! intuit also owns Mint, the budgeting app.
I kinda had to teach myself all that stuff.
I believe person B would have to sock away 19,657 a year   for ten years and then they'll be caught up to where Person A will be at the same age of 42.
Wealthfront actually does do tax-loss harvesting but there are fees. I‚Äôll definitely look into Fidelity too, never opposed to saving more.
Good luck man , and we‚Äôre still very early ; time is on our side.
I know a guy personally who aped $5k into Doge when it was at $0.06. He has been cackling his way to the bank ever since. He sold out at $0.54 I think and diversified.
I see, so you're planning to retire soon. I'm like 40 years off from retirement so after 40 years of inflation, 100k wouldn't be enough for me to live off of.
My company 401k has an average *market growth* of 11% a year each of the last 5 years. 7% is already on the conservative end and is calculated using a 75 year average of the stock market, including multiple bear markets.
Sell my body like every other day pinky
all good, and I do get the concern to a point. Appreciate the conversation on the for real. Too often we all just hate on or use derogatory comments to make a point on here if there's a difference in opinion. Have an awesome weekend! /
i don‚Äôt disagree; but why hype shit tech when it would be far more profitable to hype tech with long-term external profit formats? i.e. why not hype a coin with good staking margins and a strong smart contracts platform? it would make a lot more money.
sorry don‚Äôt have an actual link; i just pulled up the post for him when it was on the latest at r/cryptocurrency

regardless, it‚Äôs not anything new. people touch on the same couple of problems with doge all the time in comments anyway.
You really need to understand what exactly you are trading how to trade and literally everything associated with what you are doing. 

I would recommend having an investment plan / strategy then set up an IG account and use the demo account that has 20k in it to test your strategy. Do that for as long as it takes to be absolutely comfortable with using real money then go for it.
No. Short term cap gain and long term cap gains are a thing. Short is less than a year and the tax rate is higher.
Or just learning from the best. US tax filing has big scam vibes.
If you don't believe in anything you'll never be disappointed üòâ
Looks like they got picked up as a brand of Intuit about six months ago. If it's going to affect anything, it hasn't yet. Plenty of other options next year if need be.
Couldn't say. I stumbled in here from r/all, got scared, and left.
It really is. TurboTax spends a ton of money lobbying to keep the tax code confusing
Sure do! They acquired TSheets a while back, that should be rebranded as QuickBooks Time in short order as well...they are quick movers. :)
Okay... Well... Look, things have certainly changed then.

My girlfriend teaches 6th grade French Immersion and I can tell you those kids are better in 2 languages than most of the people in this thread. 

They're learning and completing math assignments that I know for a fact I couldn't do without looking them up, not because I'm *that* stupid (it's ok, I walked into any oncoming comments) but because it's just complicated math that most of us (but not all of us) go on to forget.

They are learning how to go out and learn on their own using tools on the internet and which ways to use those tools effectively. The whole idea of being able to teach yourself these things is being applied in schools these days too, because there is not enough time to cover every single topic in the world.

Stuff that you must have needed to figure out on your own, is indeed being taught in public schools. The skills necessary for submitting your own taxes being some of the most basic.
Thanks!

No the $100k number has inflation built in. 

But I do plan to retire in 20 years and not 40.
I‚Äôm not being clear let me be more clear:

10% : this number is stock market return with 100% stocks and inflation not built in

7%: this number is stock market return with inflation built in assuming inflation is 3%

3%: this number is mixture of stock and other safer assets investing with inflation of 3% baked in

3.5 mill x 3% = 100k
But doesn‚Äôt account for inflation....
You too and best of luck in your crypto adventures
I think because human psychology makes people want everything now.


Why wait 5 years for safe 500% gains, when you can hit 25,000% and get rich in a month from $50.


That's really what it comes down to, everyone wants NOW NOW NOW and not thinking of longevity.


The whole crypto market cap has doubled in the last 6 months. That's ALOT of new money. Give it time, just be thankful that there's currently mass adoption taking place, everyone has to start from somewhere and all the new-comers who are enticed to enter through hype and get-rich-quick schemes will soon get the hang of it after been rug-pulled and making huge gains etc. 

Everyone is starting to glue to their screens and learn how to read charts and whitepapers etc

That's when they'll start realising the potential of crypto and how it all works. That's when we'll see the general population start thinking about the long term and diversifying into more stable and legit projects.
Just to make sure I get it right (I'm literally new to any of this) it's not that there isn't any proft from doge, it's just it's only good for short term gains, correct?

The money I threw in isn't a serious investment but since I've read  a few things about it, I figured might as well learn the trade, seems interesting enough anyway!
Do you make money trading or buy and hold or both/neither yet?
Short term capital gains are taxed based on your income tax bracket. So that's why it doesn't matter.
I noticed after finishing taxes on TT this year, it links to CK and Mint just cause.
Is that true?
For stocks I tend to switch out at 300-400% or after 6 months of no news/updates/movement (for penny stocks). My main holds in crypto are up like, 4000% right now but they are staked. I bought them to be 7-10 year holds and I am only 3 years in right now. I will just enjoy my staking APY if they don‚Äôt hit my target this cycle and get it next go around.
Thank you, that makes sense. The other thing I worry about is the purchasing power of 100k 40 years from now. Because of inflation, the purchasing power of that 100k will be significantly smaller than it is now. That 100k 40 years from now would have the same purchasing power as 30k now. 30k of purchasing power would not be enough for me to retire.
> Just to make sure I get it right (I'm literally new to any of this) it's not that there isn't any proft from doge, it's just it's only good for short term gains, correct?

Yes.

Dogecoin has 129 billion coins in supply, and 10,000 additional coins are minted per minute. that's 14 million new coins added to the supply every day, which adds up to about 1 billion coins every eighty days.

bitcoin has a max supply of 21 million coins, so doge mints more coins every two days than bitcoin will ever have in circulation. that's why doge is ""cheap"". if doge had the same market cap as bitcoin, it would be valued at $9 per doge.

doge also doesn't have an ecosystem. it can handle a total of 33 transactions per second. this, unlike ETH2 which can handle 100,000 per second. so it can't serve as a currency. doge has minimum dev work since it's a dead coin and only a few people looking at it now because of the hype. doge is exploding because people think they're getting into it early, but if you buy now, you aren't really getting into it early. it has no future, you're buying hype.

so yeah, sure, hype could push doge to $1 or a bit more, but it has no reason to hold that value, nor would it be able to hold that value. as at $1 per doge, with 1 billion coins added every 80 days, doge would need $1 billion in new investments every few months just to maintain $1.

also, keep in mind that $129 billion (doge at $1) is a huge market cap, that's the same value as starbucks. and doge has zero use-case scenarios. sure you can buy some merch, maybe trade with a doge fan who accepts it in payment, but doge can't scale to be a currency since it's transactions are too slow.

doge is overpriced as it is, and it's going to have trouble maintaining its value due to it's always-expanding supply. if the hype falls off just a bit, doge will fall, too. and most of its hype comes from twitter, which has algorithms designed to avoid repeating trends. so yeah you might make money from doge, but it's not a guarantee, and it has a pretty huge ceiling due to doges constantly supply. basically, if you buy doge, you are buying elon musk hype, nothing else.
Buy and hold XRP - ADA - DOT
50k mining fiat and 50k trading doge, your gross income is 100k. You pay the same amount of taxes as anyone else in 100k income bracket.
This is incorrect. There are many variables and it all goes on schedule D. Most exchanges are now sending 1099B out for sales and you are also supposed to include a pdf of the transactions because you are coming up with your own cost basis. 
If I were you, I‚Äôd take my taxes to someone that knows what they are doing and get them amended.

Also .. how do you enter your cost basis? Date of purchase and sale and and wash loss? All of this info is absolutely required by the IRS. They also require a record of your transactions. 

Edit: for important warning for who ever is upvoting that person. 

And whatever exchange you used has probably cut you a 1099B .. you get a copy and the IRS gets a copy. The IRS software algorithms picks up when a tax return is filed and reported income documents have been omitted. The IRS is going to send you a letter and tell you you left this income off of your return. Because it is not on schedule D with all of the required info and documentation. They will add the gross amount on the 1099B money to your adjusted gross income and they will send you a collection letter demanding that you pay the difference in taxes. Plus any interest and penalties. Now you can pay up or amend your return. But good news .. since it takes the IRS a year or longer to get to this .. current is 2-3 yrs due to Covid.. if you can‚Äôt come up with all your proof and paperwork from 2-3 yrs ago .. you will have to pay up. The most you could possibly do is amend and move the amount that you incorrectly put on ‚Äúother‚Äù income.. but with no documentation.. you can very possibly trigger an audit at that point. 

This is not cute or clever. In some very specific situations it is possible that the tax may end up comparable.. but there are a ton of situations where it won‚Äôt. Now add in the stress and value time wasted in a long drawn out ordeal with the IRS because you think you are clever. Good luck with that. But you saved $200 by messing up your own taxes. That‚Äôs next level genus. /s
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna736386
Assuming inflation and purchasing power are synonymous, you‚Äôd be fine. But yes if purchasing power outpaces inflation or cost of living outpaces inflation, yeah my calculations can be off.

You do keep thinking that 100k in terms of 40 years from now. It may be better to think of it without inflation baked in.

So 3.5 million x 6% = 210k in terms of today‚Äôs dollars. So 40 years from now would be roughly a little less than 100k.
Something else I realized I wasn‚Äôt clear about. 

So I‚Äôm using a 3% withdraw rate. 

That 3.5 million does continue to grow because my withdraw rate is lower than the anticipated growth rate. As each year I do end up pulling out more because my principal at retirement grows as well.
Thanks!
This is totally incorrect. 
Mining goes on schedule C. Because you have expenses you can deduct .. and since mining is not considered a passive income.. you have to pay self employment taxes. Holy hell man! And then there is UBI which I‚Äôm not even going to try to explain to you. 
I can‚Äôt wait to hear how you think a crypto miner will deduct their expenses or if you just think they‚Äôre supposed to pay taxes on all of that too? How about the electricity? The facility they use? 
And just for fun.. how did you calculate your cost basis of your crypto? 

Dude plz stop running around spouting off this absolute nonsense like it‚Äôs a fact. 

Post your sources on these lies or you are dismissed.

Wow, the American way
In what situation would purchasing power not perfectly match the inverse of inflation? I thought inflation was just a rise in prices?
üëçüöÄ
I said mining fiat lol.... ie working a job.. google will give you these answers.
I bet I know who is getting audited and who may have just paid way too much in taxes .. lol
A few things come to mind. 

Not sure how old you are but we had a gas shortage a few years back. Almost 10 years now. That cost gas prices to nearly double. 

It won‚Äôt be across the board but certain items will outpace inflation. Upper education is an example but not applicable for retirement of course. As years go on meat, milk, etc could be harder to come by. 

Lumbar and aluminum are great examples as well. It causing housing prices to shoot up as well as maintenance pricing.
Your response is still incorrect ..

If someone is working for an employer, the employer pays half of the employees 15% Social Security Medicare tax. An employee cannot write off any work expense .. 

And UBI.. 

So still no.

And if trading crypto is your main source of income or you spent a certain amount of time doing it.. you can check out Mark to Market.. 

But for the love of God please stop giving out whatever kind of advice you called this.

And perhaps the fact that you are speaking in meme trash and flaunting Google as your primary knowledge base... is why you are so epically wrong. About everything.
If you made $100k + on crypto then fucking hire a CPA to do your taxes lol. They‚Äôre super cheap and they know what the fuck they‚Äôre doing. Tax laws change constantly and if you‚Äôre taking profits you don‚Äôt wanna end up fucked down the road.
Bruh you are fired up lol. I don't even hold any meme coins. I just use credit karma and fill out the forms. Been doing it for years now. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
At least try to learn something.. this guy, miners pay the same .. goes on ‚Äúother‚Äù income. Omg! Lol 
I have run across a few like this. Dunning Kruger effect on steroids. They got very lucky   on crypto and they believe that the money equals them being very very smart.
You should be able to at least realize then that he is trying to educate u :p doesn't have to be an ego death here just follow his advice if ur clueless. Have some faith that he's trying to help the community
Thank you! 
Just because he ‚Äúhas been doing it for years‚Äù... and now says he actually owns none .. doesn‚Äôt back up anything he has said. 
Just because he has gotten away with doesn‚Äôt mean anything either .. 

Fact: many people in this sub are new to stocks/crypto and that nonsense will lead them down the wrong path. 

Fact: the IRS is currently actively recruiting auditors to work remotely for the summer to audit specificity crypto and schedule C.. This is due to people like him. 

There is a wave of audits coming... will they get every single omission, cheat and mistake? Absolutely not. Will a lot of people get their ass handed to them? Most definitely! 

If anyone thinks they may have done something foolish like this guy .. I beg you .. go find a professional that didn‚Äôt get their tax knowledge from Google and dunning Kruger.. and fix it!

Because if they audit 2020 and find some fuckery.. they are going straight for 2019 and 2018.. and they can go back 7 yrs. depending on what you have done, it can escalate to felony charges. They can also see every bank account in your name , credit cards  and much much more.. 

No one is smarter than the IRS. The IRS was  just understaffed. Until this summer when filing season is over and suddenly thousands and thousands of tax professionals are laid off.. and the IRS scoops them up for a few months.."

Any person elected to higher office should have to divest of ALL their investments and put everything into a blind trust. How is this such a difficult thing to get done?! I don't care if you're a Republican or a Democrat its straight up wrong to personally hold stock in any security you have direct control over.
tldr; Members of Congress shouldn't hold or trade digital assets in the same way that they should steer clear from stocks, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on Instagram.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.*
The only thing they should be allowed to legally invest in is S&P 500 or have a 401k type of account that is managed by a third party with higher levels of transparency.
Blind trusts is the only way any lawmaker should be allowed to own any assets.
Honestly this makes sense. Wish politicians did this with stocks as well. That is something they actually have inside information for.
Plot twist: she holds eth
If I became a politician my career would be extremely short lived once they found my Reddit account
I'm not mad at this. 

If she said she didn't hold any and then hated it different story. 

But not holding it and being impartial is fair enough in my eyes.
[deleted]
I don‚Äôt blame her and it‚Äôs a quiet voice in a larger sea of insider ‚Äúnot insider‚Äù trading. I don‚Äôt have an issue with them investing per the rules and this Is something that should be clarified in a similar manner. But dude, get rid of the special interest groups and superPACs.
So, this means that if she wasn't a lawmaker, she would have bitcoin.
Its not really possible to be unbiased. But I appreciate the fact she's trying to actually do her job in congress. Hard work and doing your job in Washington DC really doesn't exist anymore.
She has been extremely vocal about the fact that Congress people shouldn't be able to hold or trade stocks, she has very vocally called for investigation into Robinhood scamming citizens, and meanwhile people in this thread are ignorant. While blaming her for ignorance. Hilarious.

>""Because we have access to sensitive information and upcoming policy, I do not believe members of Congress should hold/ trade individual stock and I choose not to hold any so I can remain impartial about policymaking. I also extend that to digital assets/ currencies (especially bc I sit on Financial Services Committee). So the answer is no bc I want to do my job as ethically and impartially as I can.""

From the article. Did any of y'all read it? Look like you didn't, just based an opinion off a headline. Embarrassing.
All law makers should only be able to hold index funds, no short term trading bs.
That's solid of her. I think congress shouldn't be allowed to trade or invest. They should have to go through a third party who manages it.
This woman gets so much hate, but things like this shows she takes her job more seriously than the rest of these clown in Congress!
Fuck Politicians!! The real culprits behind everything.
Honestly, I respect that.

Also, shots fired at Ted Cruz. Guess she owes him one for Jan 6th 2020 though.
Everything I hear about AOC really supports her being an upstanding individual devoted to her civic duty. Most of her critics have little to harp on other than her being a female. I hope she has a long and successful career. Hopefully more young informed politicians will be elected in the future and we weed out the literal dementia patients out of office.
That‚Äôs ETHically superior; ETHpecially so.
This shall be a fun read. I'll make sure to sort by controversial.
This thread just showed me something very interesting. If you check the comments of people being nasty regarding AOC, they're often into meme coins. Not sure what to make of that.
she said bitcoin, not crypto
Politics and corruption go hand in hand.
A lot of people commenting completely showing their asses by making it clear they didn't read past the fucking headline.
Bullish on integrity.
I wish all politicians were like this.
Not a fan of any politician but she gets some respect from me for that.
If only all politicians were this reasonable.
True politician. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hold Bitcoin‚Äù ‚Ä¶.. Balls deep in the alt coin market.
This is an extremely fair position to take given her influence. It is a conflict of interest for a politician to advocate for something they financially gain from.
Isn‚Äôt not holding btc also biased?
This thread has revealed something interesting to me‚Ä¶ a bunch of politically inundated morons are entering crypto.

Got some shit coins boys? No worries. That dumb money is coming. Exit liquidity for all!!!
She doesn‚Äôt hold stocks either. Leads by example yet she‚Äôs trashed in the right wing media for being a ‚Äòcommie‚Äô
Much respect.
If only even half of politicians were this honest.
But shes missing her opportunity to make moons!?!?! /s

Public servants should forfeit their ability to earn in ways that would effect their policy making. Sucks ass, but our system should be able to cover their cost of living while in office and then some (mb +50% for every year served? Idk, it might be hard to reenter the work force spending time in congress with nothing really saved up)
The other 98% of Congress members declined to answer.
I wonder how these Congress become billionaires ü§î
I'm seeing a lot of people compare this to congress holding stocks, but isn't the point of Bitcoin to be a currency? There's no inherent value unless it's a currency. 

It's sort of irrational to say both ""it's a currency"" and ""it's like holding stocks"". I'm surprised not to find this comment in the 100+ things I scrolled through.
*screaches in Nancy pelosi‚Äù
That‚Äôs a respectable reason.
Respect.  I wish more politicians had that much integrity.
Good. Members of congress shouldn't own stock or any other security or digital asset.
Unless it's blind but you know what I mean.
Aoc also dosent believe smash and grab robberies are occurring. So her opinions are obviously worthless
Lot of morons here. On one hand the same people that spew about making money on crypto as an investment asset and on the other but but but its a currency!  Pick a side, but its clearly an investment vehicle and store of wealth, and she's right.
Everyone in positions of political power should be paid the median wage of the people the represent, have no secondary incomes through donations from companies etc, hold no stocks or shares or I guess crypto at this point to so they can be entirely objective and not be bribed but this will never happen
This should be the standard across all members of Congress.
Is here name AOC? some kind of robot?
A fair position this but also should apply to stocks, perhaps even more so. ALL politicians by law should be unable to hold stocks and crypto, either personally or through a holding company, it's the only way to ensure laws are made impartially.
Crypto is the best thing we human ever introduced in our human history.
Politicians should not be allowed to interact Ruth the stocks or crypto in any way, shape, or form. They are literally just insider trading but it‚Äôs legal bc they made the rules that say so. Politicians should also have to make all their investments publicly available at all times so everyone can easily see where their loyalties really lie
She's the one
I give AOC lots of credit for not holding crypto, as the rest of Congress swing trades stocks with their inside information. 

People like to fault her for stopping NYC's $5 billion tax incentive package to lure Amazon to set up shop. The fact is, Amazon was already planning on coming here anyways and has been quietly scooping up properties left and right. Bezos just wanted to see if he could squeeze more money out of tax payers.
Wow. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶. So refreshing TBH
I use to not like aoc but the more I learn about her the more I think she might be alright.
We should blockchain everything politician does already. 

One vote one problem at a time. 

The tech is already here. We don‚Äôt need a republic system where we need an representative to vote for us. We can go full blown democracy. 

I really think so.
Does she hold fiat dollars? Wouldn‚Äôt want lobbyists to influence her with those!!!
Good. Every other politician should follow her example.

They should also have their pay be set to match the average of their constituents so they can actually be encouraged to help the people they represent.

People like Manchin don't need 9 figures of net worth. Pelosi needs to lose her position because of the blatant insider trading she engages in. Politicians shouldn't be working in the government for money. They should be doing it because they want to actually take care of the country.
Goat
Reading the comments on this post it sounds like a lot of people did not read the article. She said she doesn't invest in Stocks or Digital Currency. Could probably look this up easily to see if its true.
Makes her biased because she can‚Äôt see from a holder‚Äôs perspective .
This woman is the gold standard
She holds fiat though, is she really an unbiased lawmaker then?
Dude how can she be on the financial services committee when she admits to never investing in anything? Pretty bizarre actually.
So she owns ALGO nice.
She‚Äôs a bias lawmaker, just like they all are.
By this logic, should members of Congress not hold USD in order to be unbiased in their oversight of the federal reserve?
‚ÄúMe no I don‚Äôt hold any‚Äù 10 months later, ‚Äúhow was I suppose to know my husband took $200,000 of my money and invested it in crypto, i don‚Äôt keep track of chump change‚Äù
Good.
if true, it's v professional of her.
I don‚Äôt agree with everything she says but this is spot on.
As much as people try to hate AOC for all sorts of frivolous things, she really does seem to set a standard that make many others in Congress uncomfortable (for the obvious reasons because they are enriching themselves from their position and status.)
.... As She loads up on Pfizer and moderna stocks...
That is absolute conviction. She has my respect.
Unbiased lawmaker is an oxymoron
Honestly, if the rest of congress had half as much integrity as AOC, then there wouldn't be the rife corruption that there is. Remaining unbiased on something as profitable as crypto shows real commitment to her work.
Wow, of all the subs to have an AOC circle jerk, I was not expecting this to be one.
But let me guess, her partner or significant other does.
This should be mandatory for all assets.

Every elected government official from the township level to the President and everyone in between in any sort of regulatory capacity or a position to have inside information should not be allowed to hold individual assets of any kind, put it all in an index fund or treasuries
>she wants to do her job as ""ethically and impartially"" as she can.

She must be new.
Damn, no matter what political side you fall onto, you gotta respect the conviction.
AOC has integrity! Something lacking on the radical right!
AOC is actually one of very few politicians that gives a fuck about the citizens of this country. Unsurprising that she's attempting to remain unbiased, unlike many politicians who make changes for personal gain.
Why is AOC the only politician with morals?
This means AOC shouldn't vote on anything affecting latinos because she is one? ü§¶
AOC is A-OK, in my book.
I mean she already has my respect.
[deleted]
Good for her
Some stocks went 10x this year alone.
There must be a god controlling crypto to manage the world.
But those GAINS.
Does she hold Dollars?
Finallly one thing i agree with her on. Nancy pelosi seems to invest in stocks 1-2 days before they skyrocket because of obvious insider tips.
How could you possibly enforce this though? AOC herself could be holding any amount and there'd be no way to know unless she connected her identity to a wallet. Not that I disagree, birds shit and politicians abuse power.
My issues isn't politics owning them. It's the rules that don't seem to apply to them.
If your a politician (which used to mean public servant) is it not best to understand the needful biases of your own people to which you are meant to be a servant of? One would not serve a naive master the same as a foreign master, now would One?
Same
In other news, people lie every day.
She‚Äôs the worst.
AOC is hot
Ngmi
Meanwhile she has over 50k in student loans and wants to eliminate student loan debt
She wants to remain a clueless lawmaker.
That doesn't make sense....
""Unbiased""
No stocks, real estate or companies either.....
üôÑ
Yea I don't buy anything she says. She's just as corrupt as the rest of the.... fuck AOC.
What is this? r/politics? Of course she doesnt hold BTC, shes  everything btc wants not to be
I‚Äôm a lifelong Democrat but why does everyone care so much about what aoc says? I always see stuff about her trending on Reddit to the point where it feels like she is desperately trying to say things she thinks will go viral.
‚ÄúUnbiased‚Äù
LOVE THIS WOMAN
Good shit
I think the holding of any law maker should be common knowledge. I want to know when and why any of them are voting for certain bills. Is it for personal gain or not. As well it should be common knowledge when they are buying something or selling something. I.E. When NP husband invested heavily in Tesla a few weeks before it was announced that the government was going to have all their vehicles be electric by 2025.
Does she also hold no dollars?
AOC says or AOC reveals?
As she wish, if she desire btc, she will use this only for politic needs
Does she hold any stock what so ever? The answer is yes and it‚Äôs impossible to be unbiased law maker if you hold stock
Well this doesn't make sense to me. Bitcoin is bad but regular money and stocks are ok?
Ahahahaha. Sorry always a laugh with AOC.
Still got cash and all her shares
To be unbiased you must hold 5% of your savings in Crypto and 1% of that should be in meme coins like SHIB.

That will means you know, but not all-in to it.
Or because the point of crypto is to move power AWAY from lawmakers? How do people not grasp that, Yellen literally talked about a state run crypto currency.
At least her intentions are noble, dumb schmuck that she is.
Proceeds to hold usd
So she‚Äôs biased towards fiat?
It makes sense but let‚Äôs be real. A lot of politicians shouldn‚Äôt be biased when they hold stocks in a company that can be effected by a bill. (Tomato toMatoe)
AoC and Bernie are the only two politicians who care about Americans and don‚Äôt abuse their power
AoC is a socialist. She is the least unbiased person to exist
Lol unbiased
She‚Äôs so full of shit she‚Äôs got more bitcoin than you can shake a stick at !
She is an uneducated law maker
She ain't dumb, she is evil
[jerome powell sell off] (https://prospect.org/economy/powell-sold-more-than-million-dollars-of-stock-as-market-was-tanking/) Heres some food for thought.
She should just mix drinks and take her panties off for the cool guy at the bar.
More likely because shes a hollow-skulled dolt.
Can she hold deez?
LOLOLOL that is what she thinks will make her unbiased?
LMAO. 

‚ÄúUnbiased‚Äù the mere fact she votes her party line is bias! 

Sue is one of the many for the picture of hypocrisy!!!!!!
Clearly a SHIB whale.
Honestly I respect it. That‚Äôs the kind of lawmaker we need
A politician with integrity? What's that.
Anyone can say this and theres no way to prove it anyway lol.
It'd be better if NO POLITICIANS were able to play in Wallstreet and crypto. Not because of bias just purely due to insider trading. 

Why TF does Nacy Pelosi have the highest trading record in the HISTORY of Wallstreet?
Screw those corrupt politicians
If only the rest of the lawmakers could try and be unbiased
Wild that politicians can basically do legal inside trading! Considering a career change lol‚Ä¶
Who would have thought,  she's got more ethical values in her pinky than the 99% of Congress.
It‚Äôs a respectable position even though I disagree with her; she still has a ton of integrity. But, I don‚Äôt think the logic applies to BTC as it should to holding stocks: the latter represents owning stakes in companies that can sway your choices, but BTC like gold is just another asset, another form of currency. But I get it.
she is an hero <3
AOC gets a lot of unwarranted slack.  I know she says/does some pretty extreme stuff, but every bit of it is for the people.  Regardless of political affiliation, we need more politicians on both sides of the spectrum with this motive.
You know what? I 100% respect this
Wow this is actually super impressive. I hope other politicians follow. but im not too hopeful there.
but she holds cash, in her wallet...she holds fiat in her checking account! Biased to fiat! 

/s
AOC is like the only politician I have respect for in the US. Like, send her to Scandinavia if it isn‚Äôt working out. She is so smart and talented.
She holds dollars though.
Bullish on AOC
Well she failed miserably at being unbiased.
But her husband's boyfriend does.
Fuck AOC
She is just a puppet behind some really big and big whales.
There‚Äôs no such thing as unbiased politicians.
If you think a politician has your best interest in mind, regardless of how ideologically aligned you are with them, you have fallen for it.  None of them want you to do better but they all will tell you they do.
If only politicians did this with all the stocks they've been holding and profiting 100s of millions off of these past decades.

AoC would make a great future president for the younger generation.
I approve the sentiment, but it should be noted that not holding doesn't eliminate bias. At best, it eliminates the appearance of positive bias.

Someone with a negative bias wouldn't hold crypto as a matter of course. Someone with a bias they wanted to hide might also avoid holding crypto (at least directly).
I wish more politicians thought this way
I'm going to go against the grain here.

If they don't hold what's representative of the public's holdings, they will rule with ignorance.

What's really wrong is Nancy loading up on EV options before Biden throws out a bunch of EV subsidies.
This is a good thing, and should be more common. Maybe next we can get more younger people in charge so that they actually have some sort of idea about what laws they're creating?
Ugh the boot-licking in this thread is palatable.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm an honest, anti-corruption politician, so I won‚Äôt own any of this 100%-traceable and transparent asset! Instead, I‚Äôll stick to a tried-and-true portfolio of the same shady shit as all the other politicians!!!‚Äù
I don't agree with her on a whole lot of shit, but she and Bernie are basically the only American politicians who don't deserve to be spit at
An honest politician, rare, but commendable
AOC unbiased? That's a good one
She‚Äôs already biased lmao she‚Äôs anti Bitcoin but doesn‚Äôt want to lose support
Plot twist: She bought the ATH and panic sold at 43k, and this is how she deals with her fomo and the agony of deciding whether to buy back in or not üòÇ
She doesn't hold bitcoin because she hates the libertarian vision of money and privacy that it represents.   In her mind, libertarians are just white nationalists by another name.
Remember when she wore a dress that read ‚ÄúTax the rich‚Äù to an event that cost $35,000 per ticket?
Say what you want about AOC but compared to the rest she has some integrity.
Is there anyone who doesn‚Äôt like her? She seems pretty rad. What am I missing?
""Unbiased""
Ya, she screams unbiased‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Hopefully she doesn‚Äôt own any stocks, either.
AOC unbiased?!!!! LOL she‚Äôs literally the most biased politician around.
That‚Äôs the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever heard. Does she use electricity? Does she eat food? Does that make her biased
Unbiased?  Now that‚Äôs comical.
Lol
That's a first from her. Props
Actually there is some misunderstanding,she is actually holding more than any.
Yet she votes for her own wage.
The best way to deal with politicians remarks is to ignore them.
shes a trash politician fuck her
AOC and unbiased in the same sentence üòÇüòÇ

I don‚Äôt think Bitcoin is where people draw the line‚Ä¶ But suit yourself
Paper hands AOC!
She doesn‚Äôt even know what is Crypto so dumb afüòπ
Not to split hairs but doesn‚Äôt using one form of currency make you biased?
Make her president
She is an Idiot!
AOC, unbiased? This, the lady that has made numerous radical bias claims that have proven to be lies to further her agenda.

Interesting she now, all of a sudden wants to be 'unbiased'.
Didn‚Äôt know crypto was political
ngmi
Even if what she said is true there's still a shit ton of other biased lawmakers.
[deleted]
This is a very reasonable position.
UNBIASED HAHAHAHAHAHA
AN unbiased now millionaire
[deleted]
It‚Äôs a natural law that once a subreddit reaches critical mass it turns into a massive AOC circlejerk
So is AOC going to stop taking money from Amazon and Google as well or.....?
It's performative, she doesn't believe in or understand crypto, so instead she says she's being unbiased to win brownie points.
#HahahahahHAAaaah

Best joke I‚Äôve heard in a very long time.
Hard to disagree with her logic
maybe that makes her biased towards USD though. or doesn't she keep any savings in the bank? doesn't that make her biased towards banks?

if she invests her savings into housing she would be biased towards the housing industry. what about bonds? everyone has to keep their money somewhere.

feels like a weird thing for her to say. crypto is not like stocks that are owned by a single company. Crypto is owned by the people.

EDIT: typo
Good to see lawmakers aiming for unbiased viewpoints, seems a rare occorance.
Well I hope it's true.

Wouldn't be the first time a politician has lied about somethjng like that and I don't find my skepticism to be out of the ordinary as a result of being lied to countless times.

So I hope it's true.
People who actually understand the greater good and know that the compromises and sacrifices they have to make for the position that they choose are true leaders.
Well, if she's for Bitcoin then now's the time to do what you believe in. I would rather trust someone making policies on Bitcoin who is extremely bullish on Bitcoin because that person is going to put their heart into it. I don't see why AOC would put her heart into this unless she was opinionated on Bitcoin.  And if you can't put your money where your opinions are, then there's very little reason for anyone to believe that your opinions are genuine. She needs to invest in Bitcoin if she wants to make good policy on it.
Way to go AOC
If that isn‚Äôt the biggest joke I‚Äôve ever heard. Unbiased my ass. She is the poster child for biased
Pelosi and Schumer looking nervous

![gif](giphy|LS4GSFxtEE2Bvh05Ie)
üí™üí™ AOC '24!!
[deleted]
Lol I‚Äôm sorry, this is just cop out answer. Every lawmaker is biased?! Are your kidding!
‚ÄúLawmaker‚Äù is a loose term for someone who has written and passed zero in her term.
the dumbest person in congress. Just because you don't own something, doesn't mean you won't have a bias. She is a virtue signaling moron.
She should try take the stick out of her ass
Does she also not hold any gold or usd to be impartial?
This creature deserves no praise or spotlight
God dammit.  I just HAD to take a sip of coffee before reading that title...
Oh good, more AOC praise spam on yet another sub, because there isn't enough of that on reddit already.
This woman is really growing on me.
Does that mean she also doesn‚Äôt hold stocks or cash or property?
i hate 99% of AOC's takes but this is reasonable. To each their own , if she feels as if an investment would create a bias opinion ; so be it.
let's be real here, putting lawmaker and unbiased together in a sentence is an oxymoron
But that only means she doesn't use a specific technology. It doesn't show if she truly understands the tech enough to know what she is making laws for or against. 

But I understand why owning crypto may be a problem. It means she stands to gain a lot of she says she holds crypto everytime she legislates for it. So most of her constituents might think her legislative moves May have an ulterior goal. Make her richer. Not a scandal you want to add if you're trying to be for the common folk.

Then again, by not holding crypto, she has no vested interests unlike some of her constituents. Then you'd ask oh she is legislating against it to secure her or her friends traditional assets. 

Then it may even imply that since she doesn't hold any crypto assets maybe she isn't as knowledgeable as she stood be to be fair. 

But okay, let's wait and see where she takes this.
She‚Äôs in congress. She gets a pension, lifetime healthcare, lobbying jobs, etc. for the rest of her life. She doesn‚Äôt have to worry about retiring at 65 and invest in volatile markets like the rest of us.
Holding USD makes you a worse criminal.
I‚Äôm actually pleasantly surprised with the comments. Thought it would be a big ol AOC bash fest with a bunch of misogynistic jabs thrown in. Maybe that‚Äôs just what happens in the shitcoin subs?  Usually see a LOT of that there
Unbiased? Gtfo of here.
That's actually a good answer
This sub *hate* AOC.

lol
Lmao ""Unbiased""
That's my future president
Good job. AOC = integrity.
Lol real reason is because she missed the boat and will now use that to claim a moral high ground
I see no issue with congress members owning crypto.
How can you hate her?
She doesn't own bitcoin because she's a fool.
Lol @ AOC unbiased‚Ä¶ r/facepalm
But she holds fiat.
tell me you bought hi and sold low without telling me
Shit, she has a house though. How is she supposed to make unbiased decisions that effect the housing market? And she has a cell phone, I guess she has to recuse herself from any technology or communications issues. And grocery shopping and having a car and listening to music... damn, there's so much she's so biased about! At least there's this one thing she doesn't own, though. At least that she can be unbiased about.
Lmao AOC UNBIASED? since when?
Lol. ""unbiased politician"" sure... Keep dreaming.
Haha an unbiased lawmaker hahahahahaha 
She is like the most biased person in congress!!
Wants to be unbiased‚Ä¶pushes identity politics..
Stopped reading the title after ""AOC...""

There is nothing to be trusted or believed in anything the woman says.
Holy shit.  Her entire platform are soundbytes that appeal to emoton and bias.
This exactly right! She is absolutely the best leader we have right now. She has the intelligence and the moral integrity along with her real world experience that other politicians just don't have.
AOC - has thousands in student debt.  Pushes to have student debt forgiven.  100% unbiased.
ü§£ Does anyone actually believe her?
Ya apparently from her a couple years ago we only have 12 years to live on the planet because of climate change. Wouldn‚Äôt use her as a good example to anything
She is just a straight up dumb ass communist
Does she also wish to not hold money for the same reason‚Ä¶.?
Fuck AOC and the fake angry tweets (instead of legislating) she rode in on.
#FraudSquad
Bullshit. Either she just ""missed the train"" on bitcoin or her buddy buys it for her. I don't believe for one second she stopped herself from buying because of this ü§£
Meh, they all suck anyways. She‚Äôs lying one way or the other
if i remember correctly her BF works in IT??? Hes holding bitcoin, id bet my life on it...
Or she‚Äôs just too stupid
Who cares? This lady ever gets president she will ruin this country
Idiot
I fucking love her
Republicans: Drain the swamp!
Also Republicans: Kill AOC!
Meanwhile, AOC:
She doesn't hold crypto because it goes against her socialist values.  You can't control the people if you don't control the currency.
Good for her
Sorting by controversial lol this‚Äôll be fun
Makes sense to me. That should go for all investments. Make blind trusts/funds if you have to but they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to have stake in companies or investments they‚Äôre making laws and decisions on.
Sounds good but doesn't mean she doesn't have family or some other proxy involved.  Humans are gonna human and I don't know how someone with inside info wouldn't use that knowledge to help themselves or those close to them.
Bet her family does thou .....
So will she ditch Fiat as well ro be truly unbiased?
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs only because she wants a whole coin not just a bit of one.
NGMI
Heres the thing. i actually believe her.
Biased lawmakers hold USD while making regulations for the economy ffs
Even if she did on a cold wallet, how would we know
She better not hold any stock.
So we ignore the fact that a congressmen was biased because he held Bitcoin a few months back during the whole debate about what to do.
I dont support AOC whatsoever but I agree with her on this. Politicians should not be allowed to hold stock or crypto
I'm not on either side when it comes to politics, but honestly, she's one of the last pure politicians left.
Yes, she is a beacon of neutrality.
I have opted not to breathe air because I'm helping draft legislation on pollution controls. Please send gold stickers
Too late for that lol
I don‚Äôt always agree with AOC, but I appreciate that as far as I know she‚Äôs always been honorable.
AOC instead of virtue signaling you hold the power to make change by drafting legislation to restrict congressional members from trading individual stocks!
I love her! I wish we had more politicians like her.
Shouldn‚Äôt she also not hold any other currencies by that logic?
politicians having personal investments in private companies is insane
She's a special kind of stupid. 

Reverse that statement and ponder it. I don't hold fiat because I want to be an unbias lawmaker. It actually makes more sense. 

This is the kind of mediocrity a two-party system spawns.
Politicians just share their insider knowledge with family who do the trading
I call BS
Unbiased? Like calling for tax payers to cover trillions of dollars in student loans while she holds a five figure loan herself?
Damn I wonder how Nancy Pelosi net worth grew to 100 million
So she doesn't hold USD or any stocks either?
I consider myself a liberal, and I can‚Äôt stand how ‚Äúextra‚Äù Progressives are - especially her. She really can be totally insufferable at times.

AOC ‚Ä¶ ngmi.
This doesn‚Äôt make sense if she uses crypto in the same way she uses money. I can accept that she may not want to develop an investment portfolio, but if she‚Äôs ever bought a birthday card and somehow that didn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt affect her view when dealing with a logging lobby, then it‚Äôs totally possible to become part of the crypto space. 

I think her view betrays a lack of understanding the utility.
She holds USD how is that for biases, she should hold it to be unbiased.
What kind of stupid is this? If you live in the US your bias on any damn law you make... live in Canada and work in the US and i would say your unbiase
And you believe her?
Trust me boys we don't need a idiot like her in our ranks
Where to start lol...
> wants to be an unbiased lawmaker

lol
Unbiased HAHAHAHAHAHA
does she not own any stonks at all?
Laughing myself nearly as silly as aoc
Everything she does is a publicity stunt. Literally just wants to be President. Will do anything to diss the Republicans instead of work with them.
Here is an idea: Crypto is transparency that‚Äôs why they invent ways to ‚Äúavoid‚Äù it
Close your bank account then.
Hilarious how people believe this woman (or any politician for that matter). She said she would vote for 15/hr wage and when it came to voting, she dipped. All politicians are liars and have self-interests, and they are not yours. Do as I say, not as I do.
Which is absurd.

Has she transcended this plane and have no worldly assets? No house? No car? Nothing in her fridge? No parents?

No reason to draw the line at crypto.
She‚Äôs probably the stupidest, most clueless idiot I have ever seen in the US government. Oh, besides the current president of course.
Lmao pretty sure the ship has sailed on her being unbiased.
With that logic they shouldn't hold stocks, real estate, or dollars
Good, then stop basing everything on identity.
So, can we get some of that integrity stuff for our law makers down here in Texas?
But shouldn‚Äôt she also not hold any usd in order to be completely unbiased?
By not holding, is she not then biased against it?
Nothing about her is unbiased. This is the same person that said composting is hard....
If not BTC‚Ä¶ which? üòè
AOC is scum.
I like AOC, but really? This is the same person that wants us taxpayers to forgive HER student debt of 17k. She makes over 150k a year with full ride benefits. Seems pretty biased.
why would anyone ask? 

AOC: 'how can i insert myself into a topic that i have nothing to do with nor understand'
Does she hold dirty usd fiat then ??
She‚Äôs so hot.
tldr: this is Gotham and AOC is Gordan
God she‚Äôs the worst
Not sure how a communist can be unbiased, but ok.
and she knows she has paper hands... I don't see a green new deal anywhere do you?
Ask her how many Bitcoins does her boyfriend hold.
Bullshit.
Big fucking deal. Like theres so many other 70 year old grandpas politicians that have lots of crypto in their portfolio.
I mean I can't really argue with that logic
But you hold dollars, don‚Äôt you, bitch?
Hope she doesn‚Äôt own stocks also. Dumb
does she not own cash, jewelry, stocks, 401k, pension, health care, etc?
Why would she hold assets in something that she is actively legislating to  restrict.
[deleted]
She's either lying about not holding any BTC, lying about the intention (in that if she doesn't, it's because of the risks/volatility), or she's effectively lying about the intent and instead has her money tied up in some other ""gains for me not for thee"" fund. 
  
This sounds the same as Pelosi acting like she gives a shit about a fair economy when she's made tens of millions off of a comparatively moderate salary.
I respect that. tbh if someone had a stake in something they'd 100% be making laws that favor their investment.
Bull. Shit.
Sure, she just makes money via insider trading like the rest of them.
This is fire truck on fire irony. AOC couldnt be more biased of a lawmaker if she tried.
General question-- what kind of politician would be fighting to ban crypto? One who holds crypto or one who doesn't? Something to think about...
She's lying 100%
What a kook
By not holding Bitcoin she IS a biased lawmaker
Ya well she‚Äôs still a moron (with rockin tits)
Hahahahaha
No matter what the real explanation, AOC will take every opportunity to preach about her high road.
She's far from an unbiased politician.
‚ÄúUnbiased lawmaker‚Äù‚Ä¶that‚Äôs the funniest fucking lie. AOC is anything but unbiased. If she was unbiased, she wouldn‚Äôt be a democrat. Also, wouldn‚Äôt be a republican either.

She‚Äôs so far left leaning, she can‚Äôt see the middle of the road‚Ä¶every one of those asshats on cap hill need to be surreptitiously removed from their seats.

Before someone starts ripping into me: I do know that there are a few that aren‚Äôt asshats, which is why I said all the asshats. There‚Äôs a very small number that actually have integrity and also remain unbiased, or at least are willing to be reasonable and listen to their constituency and figure out a real possibility to solving problems instead of just blowing smoke up everyone‚Äôs ass. The problem is that it‚Äôs too easy to be corrupted or to have biases to one direction or another.
She's biased towards being unbiased..
1) lies 2) who is aoc?
Okay well I want to be an unbiased voter can you buy me some bitcoin?
And yet she holds the USD...
It she wants to be unbiased she shouldn't hold USD. Decentralized money sounds less biased to me.
Plot twists: she does own BTC and she keeps her wallet's address a secret
And all the conservative garbage can't wrap their heads around a politician that is consistent with their beliefs.
She may not directly hold it but I‚Äôd bet folding money that she has some crypto held in a trust‚Ä¶
I wouldn‚Äôt take her word for it. Or any politician.
Does this mean she can't make any unbiased decisions for anything related to USD?
Also I suspect she‚Äôs not thrilled with the carbon impact
Does she not hold money either?
What if she doesn't hold Bitcoin because she holds doge? lol.
""Unbiased lawmaker"" LOL
because you can't manipulate it and get insider tips she means.
She looks more a Doge holder.
She doesn't know how to buy it lol
But she didn‚Äôt say Satoshis‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
LOL an unbiased politician ‚Ä¶. LMAO ü•¥ü§£üòÇ
If you want any crypto friendly laws in ny you got to literally vote out these morons in power
She prob has money with Citadel.
So no one SEC will hold any stocks in ther portfolio?
She's not wrong.
And yet holds U.S. dollars-AOC is as biased as they come.  The parking lot cages photo was theater and funding Israel was as expected.  I love new people in politics, but it's the same on both sides- they don't give a F about you...only power and social capital.  These are the leeches...the whole lot of them
She‚Äôs smart. This is something I wish all politicians would do but most are corrupt. I hope she stays true on her ethics for many years to come since it does seem she will have a long career in politics. Of course anything can change but for now, she seems to be the most honest one out there. 

There‚Äôs a reason why she gets attacked by both sides by CNN and FOX. It tells me she isn‚Äôt an elitist.
I guess she doesn't hold the same moral standards for Chanel clothing...
Well‚Ä¶the thing about crypto‚Ä¶ is that it‚Äôs possible to hold it and noone know that you own any‚Ä¶
Yeah right lol

Bet one of her donors gave her a wallet
Nah - she doesn‚Äôt want it so she can pretend to be ‚Äúone of the people.‚Äù
She is useless. She can't hold Bitcoin if she would like
That woman is the worst thing to happen to politics
Wtf? I like the lady, her idealism is nostalgic to me, but she doesn‚Äôt have any problems stating her opinions and biases about other things. What a ridiculous thing to say. POV- I‚Äôm progressive who leans so far left, I‚Äôve circled around to libertarian somehow.. not somehow it‚Äôs because we will not get anything progressive relying on the government
Hahahaha
Dumb fucking cvnt
There's no such thing as an unbiased politician
She sucks so yea.
Lol that reads as she already has enough money/cronies to hold it for her.
She's funded with taxes that nobody consents to pay, therefore she already has a bias

How about she and the rest of her tax funded megalomaniacs stay the fuck away from ""lawmaking"" about anything they aren't experts in. And if you're an expert on it, you should know letting the market regulate whatever it is is better than state intervention under the color of law
AND.. She doesn't understand what it is, or how it works...
She doesn‚Äôt want to be unbiased? Lololol
She‚Äôs lying
If she stays in politics, this statement will not age well...
But she's a fiat hodler
I bet she secretly holds $AVAX $SOL $ALGO $ATOM and $MATIC lol
Don‚Äôt take campaign donations either then.
If she won't hold bitcoin will she at least hold me
Who the hell cares... she needs to be hit by a bus
I saw her dumbass cry over an empty parking lot. Unbiased my fat cock.
Hard to be unbiased when you're already a sellout ... but okay, I guess.
 She doesn‚Äôt. 

But there is a trust in her cousins name but she is the executor of that surprisingly has made a million dollars this year
But she‚Äôll happily go to the Met Galla give me Bernie or stfu lol
Who cares about this moron.
Does anyone care what this woman says aside from would you like another gin and tonic sir?
Wtf is this doing on the crypto subreddit, who gives a fuck?
She is trying to go career like the rest of them...
she just cant afford it
Bitcoin isnt a business or a fucking stock. When will you learn.
Too late
Does she own money? I'm guessing so, maybe she should get off her high horse.
Lmao then don‚Äôt hold fiat either
nice try.
Nobody_cares.gif
She has a very high integrity.
lol sureeeeeeee
What a hippo
Based representative
This is now the third highest upvoted post in the entire history of this sub. Congrats OP! Your first moons share already hit the cap for this month!
Don't start with US politics here as well, please
AOC is a communist. Who gives a fuck what she says...
She‚Äôs not very smart. I‚Äôm unsurprised she is a no coiner
[deleted]
Wow principles, rare for a politician these days.
Just checking - should she not hold the USD so she can be an unbiased lawmaker?
Does she hold any cash ?
Imagine believing AOC is unbiased.
She holds dollars. That already biases her.

Edit: I don‚Äôt know why I have to explain this comment in a cryptocurrency subreddits. She holds dollars and no BTC, so that invariably biases her against BTC, since the latter threatens the former.
She holds fiat....does it mean she is biased towards fiat?
[deleted]
Ooh politics, must be some brain lord takes here
I fkn love her
But if her abuela buys and holds crypto, then that's the fair game, right?
[deleted]
Really? AOC wants to act unbiased‚Ä¶?
Also cuz she's dumb as a rock.
I highly doubt aoc knows what bitcoin really is
You need to raise over a million dollars in donations to run a successful campaign for congress. How TF is anyone going to remain ""unbiased"" in any way shape or form?
Tldr. Nancy Pelosi doesn‚Äôt own Bitcoin
I might get a lot of hate here but AOC is one of the only politicians whose policy decisions I actually like and it‚Äôs because of factors like this. hope she doesn‚Äôt burn out and keeps going. Fox & the gop are destroying the country - and it‚Äôs part of the reason why I‚Äôm a (new) investor in the crypto market. Starting to slowly move my assets out of government reach‚Ä¶
Everyone praising her for this is gonna be so upset if she votes to hamstring crypto someday.
Thanks for being a real one AOC
She has ethics. Most politicians do not. Lots of hate her way from cowards who hate women and especially women in power. But she‚Äôs the real deal.
That is a true leader.
It‚Äôs fun seeing the Alt right melting over this article‚Ä¶
She doesnt invest in any stocks or coins or anything that her position would give her an advantage in. This is why some other congressmen and women hate her. She's too transparent and uncorrupted for their liking.
AOC for president
Lying bitch
Then she should sell her Tesla and quit accepting expensive tickets to go hang and fraternize with the rich and elite.

How anyone buys her bullshit is beyond me.
Much righteous, so woke
Lol... Unbiased
I call bs
wish all politicians would be like her!
The world needs more people like her.
Yea this the same bi tch tht says people loot cuz there hungry (eat a 50' tv) and retail crime isnt a tht bad. Youre a cun t with narratives

""UNBIASED LAWMAKER!""

###HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Lol as Brit I don't know many US politicians, but that one is notorious for being the exact opposite of impartial and objective.
This is something that makes sense and because of that I think she deserve to have some because of her behavior. But she can't because she want to be unbiased but because of that attitude she deserve to be rewarded but..
Waiting for the dip‚Ä¶
[removed]
You misspelled brainless
[deleted]
Im just glad you all believe this.
Adding this to the ever increasing list of stupid shit she says
‚ÄúRevealed‚Äù. Oh yeah? She said it and so it‚Äôs automatically true.

She‚Äôs probably got a financial manager and has no idea what her money is in.
But I bet she has fiat...
Oh bullshit. She goes to $30,000 MET Gala events for free. She doesn't need the money. Politics is about power, people. Money has always been secondary.
who is stupid enouph to believe a word that comes out of her mouth ? or think what she says makes anyyy sence. disapointing as usual people of this sub
Yeah, and I'm sure she holds no pharma stock either. 
Insider trading is legal for them.  They just use shell companies.
[deleted]
She should give away all her fiat too if that‚Äôs the case.
Well the train has left the station on that one lol
But does she hold USD?
Based on this logic she definitely shouldn‚Äôt hold fiat currency or stocks either.
I wonder if holding all that new fiat cash she‚Äôs come into over the last so many years, or her stocks, makes her biased?
Ok then get rid of stocks and fiat
But shouldn‚Äôt she not be keeping money in banks by this same logic‚Ä¶?
ok i came here expecting troll city. It was heart warming to see the community support her decision. Thank you all. Yuo made my morning
But she holds USD.  
That's Ironic.
‚Ä¶but she holds US dollars‚Ä¶ this is biased‚Ä¶ extremely biased! 

Cheers!
Following that logic, I‚Äôm sure she doesn‚Äôt also trade in stocks‚Ä¶. Right?‚Ä¶. right????????
The idea of AOC being an unbiased lawmaker is laughable but she's on the right track here. I don't really have a problem with congress people owning things but it should be in a blind trust or something along those lines. They shouldn't have control over it directly while they are in office and any communication with whomever is running their investments should be harshly rebuked and punished.
I gues the National Treasure oficials hold no dollars, then.... this is stupid.
This is a pretty stupid reason to not hold Bitcoin. By this logic, she shouldn't own or do anything. She's going to have to vote on things that affect her personally regardless, best she can do is try to be unbiased.
Problem here is she is a political figure. They need votes so they say what they half to to stay in office. This is why I‚Äôm not big into politics even if someone is honest there is always that feeling they have an alternative motive.
Does she hold fiat, stocks, bonds etc‚Ä¶ of course she does.
Uh-huh. Maybe she should refuse to hold any ""traditional"" investments and take campaign contributions, too, just so she can stay convincing.
holds fiat though
Now ask her about her stock portfolio
She doesn‚Äôt but her boyfriend does.
Not holding it would also be unbiased. It means she probably has holdings in other things that she's biased towards
How does this have anything to do with legislating laws?! The same applies to literally anything owned: cars, estates, gold, businesses...etc., so should politicians have nothing to own at all to legislate laws for such fields?! This is too idealistic and has no weight in the real world! I believe AOC does this as a PR stunt, or she didn‚Äôt think it this thoroughly.
But she has a bank account?
wait till r/Conservative hear about this. Let's watch them spin it.
Yea just her mother has the keys no worries..  there‚Äôs no way a congresswoman would ensure access to a goldmine
I didn't realize that was the only thing that kept her unbiased üòÇüòÇüòÇ....she's holding a bullshit party line
ok...but whats her IRA look like..
Ha, stay poor noob
Another reason why she is an absolute knob hound
Bullshit. She's been caught lieing before.
She's still the dumbest politician in the entire country.
Sorry guys, I can‚Äôt own any Bitcoin if I want to be a Democrat!
I have never laughed so hard than I did at the notion of an unbiased politician.
Is this a joke?
I doubt this is true. Nothing against her but I don't really believe anything a politician says. 

She probably has a shell company that owns it.
Probably should stay off social media too then if she wants to be unbiased‚Ä¶
Right ok
She shouldn‚Äôt hold anything. No house, no dollar, no job, no function. 

She could make her own coin. A congress coin. Lets name it‚Ä¶ ConCoin!

Damn somebody thought of that first.
AOC unbiased ? you really have to be a politicians to lie blatently like that, how is it possible....
So she has no cash then too.
Sure, just be an unbiased fiat holder. Although i‚Äôm sure she hedges with a stock portfolio.
then why she own dollars?
Sounds inherently biased.
I hate this lady.
She‚Äôs full of shit and if anyone even halfway believes that trash I‚Äôve got a bridge to sell you
peak cringe
Mark my words. This woman will become the President.
As if her opinion matters, she is without doubt among the dumbest politicians to ever hold office.
I dont know much about american politics but I find her hella attractive
That's what politicians always do so they don't act in their own interest! Oh wait no nvm
Also doesn't help her own abuelita because she wants to be an unbiased lawmaker.
Well SHE is USELESS to us!
She doesn't hodl Bitcoin because she's an economic illiterate.
I can't take an america hating literally-dumb bitch like her seriously.
Well, at least shes consistant in her stupidity.
Does she not live in a house, because that would make her biased towards housing issues?

Does she avoid public transportations, because that would make her biased?

Does she avoid food, because that would make her biased?

Did she avoid going to school to not become biased towards the school system in the US?

Honestly, there's a part, where it's about politicians not shaping politics in a way to personally enrich themselves, but not taking part in life, because that could make you biased seems to be going a bit far.
Too bad for her
She‚Äôs gotta invest in something
That's how you know she's all in on XMR ahahahah
/r/TechnicallyTheTruth
so virtuous
She probably got Monero
Honest question. Why is this a good thing? Wouldn‚Äôt you want someone more involved with the industry he plan to regulate, so they understand the pros and cons? Wouldn‚Äôt you want someone making policy for home buying to have actually bought a home? There is a difference between holding stock and crypto vs leveraging your authority for personal gain. I would be more in favor if she had crypto experience and made it transparent, rather than no experience at all.
Respectable, in a way, but dumb. Get that shmoney.
AOC confirmed for holding SHIB
>unbiased lawmaker

Yeah huge doubt on that (its like democrats want people to hate them lol)
But in all honesty, regulating a decentralized currency will be impossible  and the new laws probably won't get passed anyway and even if it does not much will change

On a side note, I hate how fucking boomers run your country and try to regulate things they know nothing about but most of congress is pretty favorable views on the free market so them passing any taxes probably won't happen (like I already said but who knows)
Counterpoint: not holding bitcoin is taking a position on bitcoin
But she is biased just like all law makers.
Uh‚Ä¶.so she doesn‚Äôt hold stocks or real estate as well??
Like the rest if the residents of hell (DC $ NY) she gets her $$ the old fashioned way‚Ä¶. Brib‚Ä¶.. errr donations.
Cause she holds Kadena
Principle is awesome when your peers have any idea what it is.
Not holding BTC is just as big a conflict as holding BTC. And in truth, it is a much bigger conflict of interest as it aligns you with fiat and the traditional Finance System that already controls not just the US but practically all of the governments of the West. I'd never vote for anyone who doesn't own at least some BTC.
I bet she has DOGE though
ETH on the other hand‚Ä¶..
Don‚Äôt care.
Whenever I miss an opportunity and dont want to look like a sucker FOMO'er I usually make up some stupid excuse too. Typically its some nonsense about being too busy with work and kids to sit and watch my computer all day everyday. Even though that has nothing to do with it...but no one else knows that.
Bullish on $AOC!! Where can I get it??
LOL!
She makes laws? I thought all she did was propose half thought-out, insane ideas
We should not hold BTC because we want to be unbiased citizens too.
[Metavers](https://mrcloudinfo.com/metaverse-crypto/)
Ok umm ok
Is she holding fiat?
She‚Äôs gonna miss out on a fortune
HE\*\*\*\*
Ngmi
The only reason she doesn't hold Bitcoin is she could never afford it before now (maybe not even now). This is just a political show. She would've definitely owned it if she knew it would peak at 70k.
I‚Äôm willing to bet she‚Äôs against it for climate change reasons but won‚Äôt actually say it because it‚Äôs unpopular among the youth.
That's what her hedge fund manager is for, duuuh.
For sure whenever I think of AOC unbiased is the first thing that comes to mind. /s
Wait, does that mean she doesn't have a bank account either?
She is the same person downplaying all the crime going on in large cities when you have Democratic voters \ politicians speaking about it.  Her stupid views on bail reform is a gift to criminals.
The last god damn thing anyone should do is care about what AOC does.
Unbiased lawmaker üòÜ
She doesn‚Äôt need because she is wealthy enough with his position. But not everybody his lucky like her.
How about her male alter ego Alex Cortez?
does she actually not hold or tell people she doesnt hold?
Last time I checked, AOC was a brand that sold affordable gaming monitors.
Bullish on AOC
She‚Äôs just another player in the same system. Another body put in front of us to give us the illusion of choice and ‚Äúprogress.‚Äù
Seems to make sense. Does this mean she doesn't hold dollars too?
But if crypto is supposed to be an alternative to or replace cash, shouldn‚Äôt holding it be non-controversial? By this logic, she is biased because she has a bank account with USD in it.
Look at this bot moon farming
imagine being this ngmi
She holds turnips.
Does she hold dollars? If so maybe she has a dollar bias?
Although I applaud her effort to be unbiased, ultimately I think it will come back to hurt her because as a politician she will (has) need to raise money and therefore be biased towards her ""investors"".  

&#x200B;

There's just no such thing as being ""unbiased"".  It's a moral platitude and anyone using it only reveals themselves to be a moral elitist who believes that they can make an argument for their own purity regardless of whether it's grounded in reality.  

&#x200B;

I believe the antidote would be for her to actually *buy* crypto and then use the reasoning that, just like she gets paid in USD and just like she raises money from donors, she wants to be educated on cryptocurrency and have a stake in that as well.  Or at least take a stand and say that you don't own crypto because you don't believe anyone but the government should be allowed to create or transact a store of value.
In that case she shouldn‚Äôt be holding any fiat either üòÇ I don‚Äôt have any beef with politicians holding an asset. It‚Äôs insider trading that I (and most others) have a beef with.
does she hold dollar bills?
Does she not hold dollar either?
 BS!
Maybe she shouldn't hold fiat either.
Let‚Äôs talk about that dress ‚Ä¶.LETS TALK ABOUT THAT  RICH PEOPLE BALL YA WENT TO AOC
Yea right, good luck fighting innovation.
Last people who tried was Blockbuster, hope they're happy with their Airbnb in Alaska or some deserted place
Well she hold fiat, so ü§∑ üòè
Good. It‚Äôs a clear conflict of interest and they regulate to line their pockets. Crypto not for you Uncle Sam.
Then she shouldn't hold USD either
Holier than pope nonsense in order to look popular for the most naive part of the electorate.There is no such thing as unbiased lawmaker, if they don‚Äôt hold any stocks etc. someone does it for them. The average politician is just smart enough to not bringing it up
Well she better stop being a consumer completely then lol
Yeah okay ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
I bet she holds USD though.
She's still trash. I can't stand her
AOC is a very special kind of stupid ...
HA!
So she advocates fiat.
If she held Bitcoin she could have been a *retired lawmaker*
How noble, I guess.
I hope she dos not hold fiat either than.
What a weird rationale‚Ä¶ does she not drive or buy cars either because she wants to be unbiased towards driving laws and vehicle regulations? Does she not own a house in order to remain unbiased towards property tax law?

Senseless statement by her, and yet Reddit just eats up
As a staunch AOC hater - I respect this.
AOC is hot
Doesn‚Äôt hold it yet***
Bet she holds USD though?
I mean, if we realistically want Bitcoin and other crypto to be used as a currency, then I don't see any reason to cheer for her virtue signaling.   


I think people who believe in it as a currency shouldn't feel guilty when the currency's true value is recognized. You aren't investing in a company. You are taking control of your finances, away from the institutions that finance politicians like her. This shows she believes crypto is comparable to a stock or an ETF when in fact it's the democratization of finance.
She kinda cute
she has student loan debt but wants it forgiven. hmmm
So stocks in public companies are less bias? WTF. Very telling.
AOC can hold my bitcoins any day ;)
Bahahahahhaahahahahahahahaah
I can certainly understand people attacking her politics and agenda, I don‚Äôt agree with a lot of it myself.  What I don‚Äôt understand is how people are constantly attacking her character.  She is one of the few politicians that feels like a real genuine person, like one of us, and she clearly cares deeply for her constituents.  We need more politicians like her on both sides of the aisle.
Too late! Another one that is full of it!
While she‚Äôs at it she should stop taking money from Soros
This politician can only be purchased with cash
Who cares about AOC‚Ä¶
But then, who funds her?! üòÇüòÇüòÇ These people are so full of it.
That‚Äôs great on her. She could‚Äôve been incredibly rich had she rode the hype train, and being in her position, I imagine she saw all the signs coming from long ago.
Not sure how she is smart enough to make any decisions on Crypto.  Her or 99% of any lawmakers.
Probably should let her other market positions go as well then. What a stupid thing to say rather than just I don‚Äôt get it or I don‚Äôt like it or I didn‚Äôt get in early.
I bet she holds stocks in all the movers. I don't believe  what she says one bit. She definitely  dwells into crypto as well. No one is that much of a Saint. The person who perceives themselves  to be that honest is usually  the one forced to hide skeletons to protect their image
She looks like the llama from emperors new groove
She‚Äôs the most biased POS politician around. This is a joke.
Doesn't that make her biased against the crypto currency as regulating it will have no affect on her. Our lawmakers should be a representative group of people like us. Some holding certain assets and some not.
Since Biden ""won in a landslide"" (their words) with 51.3% of the vote, maybe she should take only 51.3% of her paycheck?

And assuming 51.3% approve of her is generous. 

But of course not!  She'd argue that for her to be truly unbiased, she'd need to take money from both sides of the aisle.
We need to be electing way more people like AOC and Ayanna Pressley.
She‚Äôs so honest- not
Silly OP: horses can‚Äôt buy crypto
AOC unbiased???  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
She holds Monero because its private
She‚Äôs one of the few ones with integrity.
That‚Äôs my president
I crawl over five miles of broken glass to let AOC step on my throat with her heels.
Just another reason I'm willing to fight and die for this woman
You may not like her views on policies but if every politician in Washington conducted themselves the way AOC did this country would be in an exponentially better position and I‚Äôm not exaggerating.
I‚Äôm hodling for AOC.  May have to wait until she finishes her term as President before gifting her!
The moose wants everyone to know this.
What a wasted opportunity
Sounds broke
Fair enough. Appreciate the rare politicians like this
The bare minimum but at least it‚Äôs something.
Kind of tells you a lot about her.  She feels if she has any invested interest in something, she can't be unbiased.
It's a terrible mentality to have and all to common.
Because all of you are insane
Integrity???
Or because it's a terrible investment
Moralsüëç
Uh... Lol
lmao please

She's both too dumb to figure out crypto and likely has zero savings to even invest with to begin with.
Haha sure. Good job AOC. Don‚Äôt ever admit to it!
I agree with AOC. What a strange time to live in
Yikes! I hope this isn‚Äôt true. Makes me wonder how else is she misguided/dropping the ball!
I think she might be the only good person in the U.S. government right now.
Quick, Everyone send her some bitcoin
She is my Patriotism avatar!
I wonder which bank's credit cards and debit cards she uses ... oh and desigber shoes and handbags ... oh and lipstick and makeup ... is she biased towards those companies?
Unbiased? Lmao.
She is anything but unbiased. Unkowledgable, unappealling, unintelligent, unbearable yes, but not unbiased.
She's a statist, she's biased af lol
She will never win as president. She has way too much integrity.
If you had to totally divest, what successful person would want to come back and be a public servant?. Whether or not you believe it , Trumps term probably will cost him millions in the big picture and they wouldn‚Äôt be scrutinizing every business transaction if not for political vendettas. That should discourage people with experience from ever running
I mean if this is a great idea then shouldn't holding fiat be looked at the same way?
An ""unbiased lawmaker"" is about as real as a flying unicorn.
So... she holds bitcoin then.
Not holding is being biased against it. 

Holding cash would make her biased toward central banks and the industrial-military complex?

Not sure I get the logic.
She is also probably poor . Aren‚Äôt all mr politicians making low 6 figures and it all
Goes to high rent in DC .
Takes a couple years before you get your bribes and cash
Her political Sugar Daddy hodls it for her.
Meanwhile Ted Cruz argues in favor of digital currencies.
How can she be unbiased when she does not know how crypto works?
And yet she holds fiat.
I think that‚Äôs admirable as a concept but I do hope she does the fundraising necessary otherwise. I don‚Äôt agree with her on everything (many things) but I do respect her attempts to be less manipulated than many other politicians.
Wow ‚Ä¶.is that ‚Ä¶no can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶.no it is‚Ä¶.actual ethical behavior.
I was hoping she would be involved in legislation on air and that way she could just hold her breath. 

Then we would get a bi-partisan filibuster
Fine. Now lets find out how many members of congress are taking ivermectin.
Liar.
I love AOC üòª
Probably the only thing I agree with her policies
Rather based
Yikes this thread
She'll be running president election 2024.
Lies
Lolololollolololol
Later: ""I didn't know my investment firm had purchased BTC on my behalf.""  Isn't this how this works?
Congress should have to repeal 2 laws for every 1 that they make.
So‚Ä¶ im assuming she owns stocks tho ü§î
Who is AOC.... remember my college days when I first bought AOC first flat screen monitor for my PC.
Ok boomer
I would definitely D-ce tralise her
Idc what she says but I‚Äôll sure fuck the goofy out of her
The GOP  knows she will be a force and already trying to slag her
Soon she will speak some words and then market will crash and she will buy at dip.
I AM NEVER GOING TO THE DOCTOR SO I WONT BE BIASED ABOUT HEALTH CARE .
""Reveals"" is maybe a mischaracterization. 

I would suggest ""says"" or ""claims"". 

While her stated reason is possible it might be other things. 

Maybe she does it so she can grandstand in this way? 

Maybe she is just not interested in investing at this stage or doesn't have enough money to invest seriously?

Maybe she never thought about it and a staffer came up with this as something that sounds good?

After a few decades watching politics my assumption is that if a politician says something, it means they want you to believe it. It tells you nothing about whether a thing is true or not.

Consider Joe Biden

> I will not sell weapons to the Saudis

> Sells $600m missiles to the Saudis.

> I will cancel heaps of student debt

> Cancels a tiny amount of student debt

In the interests of bipartisanship

Trump

> I will drain the swamp + build a wall

Trump also

> Does not drain the swamp or build a wall
Yea but does she even understand what the fuck crypto is?
Oh fuck off
Liar
Why hold bitcoin when you can just trade ahead of news that you were privy to as a congressional servant?
Don‚Äôt give her any. She sucks.
Bartenders only keep cash tips
Does she expect all law makers to sell off all their Euros too?
Only that she doesn't pass any laws lmao
Hahahahahhahhahahahahaha
I get what she is trying to do but ouldn't possesing fiat and not any crypto make her more biased against crypto instead of possesing both? (which would be more unbiased)
She has plenty of GME so don‚Äôt worry about AOC!  the queen has this shit on lock‚Ä¶ u can‚Äôt short a stock over  140% honestly signs point to over 200% shorted.. and hedge funds must buy back all shares! Those who hodl will be just fine
Who needs crypto and you can embezzle campaign donations?
And Pelosi doesn't trade stock when she has inside info for the same reason. Her husband does. I'd bet AOCs partner does the same thing.
She's what I'll call a Twitter politician.  Really good at owning the opposition in 140 characters or less, but not so much for developing actual workable solutions and building a consensus and being a leader.
Unwise, unintelligent, uninformed, unreasonable‚Ä¶.  She‚Äôs trying to add ‚Äúunbiased‚Äù to her resume.
Why would she hold bitcoin when she can inside trade the stock market?
She has unconscious biases though.
Better not own any USD either, the biased b
I bet she holds fiat though.
But owns shit ton of pfizer stocks üòÇ
Lol whatever. She's a sham either way. No different than any other politician.
I bet that bitch holds stocks.
lol these lawmakers were literally cashing in during COVID when people were dying and they we betting on companies to fail.   They don't give damn about you
[deleted]
How exactly do you ""reveal"" that you don't hold Bitcoin? Seems like a stupid marketing stunt to make her more appealing.
Bitcoin was created as a currency.

I hope she doesn't hold USD.
Truth is she's too dumb for crypto.
So... it holds ETH? Bullish
Lol, she needs a refund from her college.
Does she not hold dollar bills either?
She most definitely has stocks that influence her decisions. This means nothing.
AOC is a turd and a half.
By not owning she means not directly. I‚Äôm sure there is a shell corp somewhere offshore holding her stocks and crypto.
[removed]
Not holding bitcoin is also a bias.
Does she have stocks ?  Health care ? Own a car ? Travel to the Middle East ?     
So she can‚Äôt have an opinion or speak to sway opinion in any of the above. 
She‚Äôs such a hypocrite.
She is incredibly biased regardless.
Unbiased!?! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
She is all fake, thb.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J8PJfvGzWg
Hahahahaha what. Last time I checked she is paid in USD and votes on and creates laws that affect USD..
>AOC  
>  
>wants to be an unbiased lawmaker

LOL WTF
I get it. She's young, beautiful and Latina (or Latinx before I catch hate). But she's also socialist. Meaning if anyone here plans on making any real money she's coming after you so she can give money you had to be extremely disciplined to create; live on a budget, hold through gut wrenching dips, buy coins you researched, etc etc. -- to people who are terrible with money; who will in turn go and buy another flatscreen to watch more Jerry Springer all day. Think people. This is not a beauty contest.
[deleted]
""Unbiased law maker"". She's a hardcore leftist, I'd even say communist. This is NOT the person you want making laws.
Well if you hold USD, then you just became biased. Dumbish
Can't even operate a garbage disposal. She doesn't even know what bitcoin is.
Who even listen to this bitch
translation: Doesn't know how to
What a scum.
Hope she doesn't hold dollars either
so she hold fiat instead
what about her husband?
[deleted]
Bet she has ETH lol
Ngmi
She probably does though ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|this_is_gentlemen)
But does she hold BabyAOCMoonCoin
press F to doubt
I still like her!
This is why I hate crypto bros. They are desperately looking for celebrity politicians to pump their bags
She‚Äôs pretty
Baddie.
She‚Äôs too good to be true.
I haven't seen a US politician yet that seems to know shit about crypto.  AOC has always seemed like someone thats extremely daft anyway.
For what? So she can push her communist agenda??
But she owns a Teslaü§î
I‚Äôm scared one day something shitty will be revealed about AOC. She‚Äôs a breath of fresh air around here.
smartest ever
Oh, so think there's a word for that. Let's see, where is it... Oh, here it is. *Respectable*
Unbiased. Lol, that cunt is anything but unbiased.
Was lukewarm on her, but I feel each week we hear more good news about her. Bullish on AOC
Eh. I appreciate the thought, but also crypto isn't a stock.  Feel you'd be allowing yourself to be left behind
if you actual believe that, then you must have been dumb enough to vote for her to begin with. jesus christ total clown world.
Does she hold $?

>unbiased
No fucken way I believe her when she says she has no investments because it‚Äôs a conflict of interest for law makers.
She shouldn't hold any fiat either then. She's a moron.
So I suppose she doesn't hold fiat either ?
She doesn't understand crypto, that is why she doesn't own BTC. She says this to hide her ignorance and seem incorruptible. She is as fake as the rest of the politicians in DC.
should sell houses and cars for the same reason
If you sell something you aren't holding it. 

If her life partner has Bitcoin she's telling the truth.

 You have to learn the double speak.
But she's ballsdeep in Doge
Bet she holds fiat though. Clearly she doesn‚Äôt understand yet what BTC is
But she definitely owns fiat currency / usd.

By her own logic, she is biased towards one currency over another currency alternative. 

I like her position re asset ownership and bias in lawmaking, more in congress should take that position - Manchin for example.
Fucking phony
I call fucking bullshit
Does she hold fiat?
So she doesn't eat bacon because it would give an unfair advantage to pig farms.
FUCKING WHAT!

This wretched halfwit  Could not even spell Unbiased  if she tried.

And we all see through this FAKE virtue signaling
But she's already an extremely biased lawmaker to begin with?
AOC reveals she doesn't hold bitcoin because ~~she wants to be an unbiased lawmaker~~ she's struggling to be relevant.

There, fixed it
It‚Äôs a good thing politicians never lie
But she holds fiat
Hahahaha
lmao okay I totally believe you AOC

/s
Now she‚Äôs a comedian? Such a clown.
Or because she is just a trashy person, definitely not an unbiased lawmaker though‚Ä¶
Now this is political humor. AOC unbiased wow.
She is literally one of the most bias lawmakers, regardless of crypto or stock holdings. She is so far to the left that can't see the centrist horizon (just like Rand Paul on the right). There is absolutely nothing unbiased about her.
All I say is THANK GOD she doesn't hold any OTHER forms of currency or have any kind of retirement strategy either!
Just wait for the green new deal and socialism that she backs is ushered in. They'll make sure it's illegal to own your BTC and other crypto.... that it's the government's job to spread it out equally... AKA they tax it into oblivion, keep 90% and spread around 10%. She's a fool.
An unbiased lawmaker is exactly what she thrives to not be
In reality, she is just a brainless communist
absolute class
She‚Äôs got morals and values and not Africa‚Äôs to call out cult republicans so refreshing.
Liar, her family holds over $2.3M in BTC‚Ä¶ Look behind the facade of a BS Bold titled article üíµüîÅüíµü•±
Is there really such a thing tho?
By not holding it, she is biased.

An ubiased person would have a diversified portfolio.
Unbiased lol.
i disagree on nearly everything with this bitch but ill take an honest enemy over a dishonest ""friend"" anyday.
It's like saying ""I don't own a smartphone so that I'm unbiased against technology."" Or ""I don't wear clothes that so I'm unbiased against garment manufacturers.""

By not holding, she also has a bias.
She probably lying about what she holds and doesn't hold. She's a politician at the end of the day. Funny to see replies here of people that blindly believe what she says.
Since when does AOC care about being unbiased or ethical?
No she wants to shut crypto down, obviously.
Or because she doesn‚Äôt have enough money after spending it all on apartments and clothes‚Ä¶or understand what it is or where to buy it
I love leftards
doesnt make sense as this isnt a stock but a currency but whatever, i like her politics, this is the first time i see her banging chest for no reason
#u/AIOC OPEN YOUR VAULT
Good, more Bitcoin for the rest of us
She doesn‚Äôt hold coins, instead she bought a ton of George W. Bush‚Äôs NFTs of nudist portraits inspired by country leaders.
I hope this doesn't also mean, *I'm not in the space so I don't know about it*.  People like her will be making policies and regulation.  It would be a nightmare if nobody familiar with the topic was in the room at that time.
What does this even mean? If you don't hold crypto people will think you're ""biased' against it. If you hold it, lawmakers will instantly think your policies are driven because of your crypto holdings.

Like holy shit, these politicians hold SO MANY STOCKS... What a stupid distraction to a root issue.
As much as I don't like AOC, and as much as I kinda doubt that is her real reason, that is the right reason. I have thought about that and I realized that if I ever ran for any office since I am very pro crypto I would want to sell all my crypto so that I could promote good crypto legislation and work against bad legislation without being accused of doing it for my own benefit.
surprisingly reasonable stance.
The beauty of Crypto is, WE WOULD NEVER KNOW.
The funny thing is they have very limited impact on crypto like BTC's value but hold stock all day when they have complete control over that
She obviously never tasted money. All politians will eventually get greedy. There's no way around it. She'll turn around soon or later.
What about her assets in the Pelosi holdings??
Yes, honey, we wouldn't want you to be biased. Keep up the good work brining communism to America. Not like we had generation after generation giving their life to stop the very thing you are pushing.
Good for her. I wonder if she holds stocks in any individual companies or maybe just index funds. It would be nice if other politicians followed her lead.
Does anyone believe this bullshit?
Politicians should have the right to own whatever they would like as long as they are completely transparent about their assets and it‚Äôs relation to their career (donors, stances, legislation, etc.). Then we can choose if we want to vote for someone with $3 million invested in big tobacco who has deep Marlboro pockets funding their ads and a constituency with a history of lung cancer (my decision would be to not vote for this politician). There‚Äôs nothing wrong with bias or incentives, but there‚Äôs something wrong with claiming to be unbiased or dec-incentivized when that‚Äôs virtually impossible
She‚Äôs just such a good girl. Let‚Äôs throw her a parade!
Damn that is some fancy ass politicking with that statement. 

I also like the ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt hold‚Äù cause I can read between the lines in many ways
Whenever the wealthy says ‚Äú **I** don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù, I ALWAYS think it‚Äôs because they let their LLC or Foundation do it for them.

This is not directed at AOC, per se., but it should be our instinctive thought about ALL rich people.
Can't she let her investments be handled by a third party? Just like how politicians do that for business interests. (I don't know the term. Every president did it, I understood, except Trump.)
""But if I did, you'd have no way of knowing I did, so this statement is basically just me appeasing those who do not understand.""
""AOC a better person and a better politician than Nancy Pelosi. Also, water is wet. More at 11.""
This is an amazing way of spinning the fact you have no idea what crypto is and totally missed the boat. Props to AOC for always turning her lemonade into lemons
While taking lobbyists donations‚Ä¶..ummm ok.
Does she hold stocks or receive payments from entities other then the government? I‚Äôm betting the answer is yes.
I guess she shouldn't comment any further on budget discussions or how taxpayer money should be spent, seeings that's where her official salary comes from.
I don‚Äôt agree with many of her policies, but I def agree with this. Politicians should not be holding individual crypto or equity names. They should only be allowed to hold index funds if they want to run for any political office. Same goes for any of their direct family members. It‚Äôs a position that you are in to better the county, not to make a successful career out of and to enrich yourself. Only way to eliminate conflict of interest is to make it impossible to have conflict. 

Also our politicians are way too old and have so much diminished capacity. If our active politicians are dying from old age, we need to seriously consider re-evaluating age limits. But that‚Äôs another story.
One would think this should be common place with other investments or assets like stocks specifically.
Wow this is reall a Rorschach test. ETH jokes, people in the circlejerk and the contrarian she sucks. 
She‚Äôs more honest than the cronies but she sold out a long time ago.
One of the few politicians left who arent completely corrupt
Hfsp
1.	Believe nothing politician says. Its all optics.
2.	she is probably bought and paid for by someone who doesn‚Äôt like crypto.
Hope she‚Äôs saying the truth. And yes, being politician opens up to unlimited opportunity to lobby.
I mean I agree but the asshole in me wants her to buy some and get positively biased towards it.
Based and cryptopilled.
[deleted]
Respect
Just because AOC isn‚Äôt holding it doesn‚Äôt mean progressives shouldn‚Äôt invest their disposable income into crypto and stocks. Unfortunately it‚Äôs the way out from salaried life and gives financial independence. We need to be financially literate
okay.. now tell the others !
She mst be into ETH
Hopefully she'll teach those FED bankers a thing or two about conflicts of interest.....
It‚Äôs a good point.
yeah, sex is good, but have you ever had an elected official with integrity....omg
Now Eth? That‚Äôs a different story
Eh, it's a noble aspiration but it's impossible to be unbiased... like you could just extrapolate to say that means she's biased in favor of cash (specifically, US dollars).
Hey as long as she understands crypto, it‚Äôs not bad.  Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are unbiased or biased if you don‚Äôt have the proper knowledge.
I'll share with you bb
I think it‚Äôs a wise position to try to remain unbiased and untainted from gains/losses
She does hold a nice ""eat the rich"" dress.
Whoa. Integrity? In politics? I can't wait until I'm 70 and I get to vote for her for president.
News flash you could own Bitcoin as a lawmaker and still do what is best for the majority even if it would hurt your own crypto position. That would make you a good lawmaker.
She does hold ethereum tho üòÑ
While the intention is much appreciated, there is a small caveat. It is a bit easier to know if you are holding stocks or have investments that lead to a conflict of interest.

However, it is impossible to know if she holds Monero. Not just her but anyone. 

The value of privacy people. Never let it die
This is the way
I admire her moral standpoint on this situation. However, imagine not holding btc 

OMEGALUL
Every politician holds stocks.  The bias coming from holding stocks has much more influence than holding a decentralized network protocol coin.  Saying you don‚Äôt hold bitcoin because you want to remain unbiased is silly and proves you don‚Äôt understand what crypto is.
*Plot twist: she transfer BTC to abuela*
I appreciate this.
If you think its not ok for lawmakers and government officials to stocks or insider trade then you shouldnt be in favor of them owning crypto either. 

Its the same thing silly
I don't like AOC for a few reasons but this... this I like. Good job AOC
Politicians shouldn‚Äôt know any of what they hold because all their investing should be done in a blind trust while they‚Äôre in office
We should just ban them from holding investments at all and give them fat bonuses based on how much the economy empirically improved. If we can't get rid of corruption why don't we just make the American people the biggest lobbyist.
Why are people so supportive of this?  Bitcoin is money, I want politicians to have a vested interest in it.  
Politicians should also have etfs and such because I want them to want the economy to succeed but I agree with not allowing individual stocks as that makes them want to write laws that favor those companies and hurt their competitors. However, if they arent allowed to own stock then they just take bribes under the table from these companies. Also, what if they owned the stocks before they entered office.
>""Because we have access to sensitive information and upcoming policy, I do not believe members of Congress should hold/ trade individual stock and I choose not to hold any so I can remain impartial about policymaking,"" she said.

Woah, an actual sensible take from a politician, you love to see it
A lot of people saying lawmakers should hold crypto or stocks due to conflicts of interest 

I agree with that logic, however these are still humans who need to retire one day... what are they supposed to do? Keep money in a bank to be eaten by inflation and never grow enough to retire on? Invest in housing? That's another conflict of interest. 

Ideally their money would be in a blind trust, practically though they'd still be managing their money behind the scenes. There's no good solution.
She‚Äôs long on eth.
This is a good thing.
Lawmakers should have a fund they contribute to that grows by the rate of cost of living increase yoy so that they can make better laws
Hey be nice if most folks switched to bitcoin, need to get rid of petrol dollar.
HFSP
Now ETH on the other hand...
""hold"" ""bu√≠tCOIN"" now please remind me, is this a currency or a piece of speculation
I remember that one politician who said a while ago that cryptos are racist because they're expensive or something.
Question: does she hold USD?
Abstaining from market participation does not make her unbiased. In fact, quite the opposite.
Also wanted to remind people her partner (now Fiance?) Is a software developer so besides being a millennial so it's not because she doesn't know she has almost basically direct access to a person who potentially knows about this. She doesn't hold for purely ethical reasons
Bitcoin is just an inefficient database.. thats why
I can respect that
1. The BTC is in her ""husband's wallet""
2. She holds alts
The only investment US politicians should be allowed to make is in US Treasuries
plot twist: she bought meme token called unbiased-token
Well, it's tax money. It'd only be fair if they were only allowed to invest in public institutions, we'd end up indirectly receiving some money back at least.
One of the good ones. 

Doesn't mean she doesn't have other people hold assets for her
Assets > billions trust

Done. Hold whatever your trust executor decides.
Btc is not only crypto
As long as she isn‚Äôt anti Crypto, it‚Äôs fine by me if she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt or does hold Crypto.
This is good, more pols should do this.
Ignoring the dmiwits on here who have tied their own self worth to crypto, it's a respectable decision. The States would be a lot better if most of the politicians had even half of her integrity.
I don‚Äôt care if politicians invest their money. I think everyone should be educated and entitled to do so. The problem is all of the insider info they use to orchestrate market mayhem through bull runs and sell offs. They should just be restricted in the same manner you and I are.

 The same rules for retail investors should apply to everyone, but we know that will never happen. *rules for thee, not for me.*
r/noshitcoins
Tell her to try some Algo.
This sounds about right, but I‚Äôve been thinking that we should have lobbyists for politicians that all they do is explain cryptocurrency and show them how to buy and the results will probably speak for them self‚Äôs and we‚Äôll have all these politicians hooked on the gains, lol.
She holds dogecoin
And the BTC Boys on twitter are fucking LIVID. for no logical reason that we can discern.
A majority of people don‚Äôt yet hold crypto and it‚Äôs too easy to claim that is for principled reasons. I‚Äôd be more impressed if she said she didn‚Äôt hold any stocks.
Is it really any different than putting money in your bank and not having that conflict of interest when they need to be bailed out? I love her but I don't know, it just feels like no matter what you can't separate your conflict of interest entirely and just using some common sense ethics of not investing in medical equipment companies when you have insider knowledge of an upcoming pandemic seems like a sufficiently reasonable level of being unbiased.
Sounds like a bias to me and honestly I'd rather have her trade crypto than not, people who are against anyone supporting her trading crypto or supporting her decision not to trade crypto needs to leave this sub, we are here to advance cryptocurrencies to a place where we take over the financial system, therefore the more team members we have the better, all politicians every single American every single individual all over the world need to have Bitcoin, ethereum, and avalanche.
Lol. Ok
This actually doesn't make sense.

Is she not supposed to hold stocks or bonds? 

How about cash? 

So if your a public servant you are locked out of all asset classes? 

I agree they shouldn't use insider information but it's also unfair to be blocked from investing.
Bot doing good work...
True Hero!
Bs she holds crypto. It's like saying Nancy Pelosi doesn't own stocks.
Ngmi
She didn‚Äôt buy the dip
If you believe anything that comes out of her, or any other politician's mouth, then I don't know how to help you.
Not having bitcoin also makes you biased as you don't want bitcoin to go up so people invest in traditional stocks (which she probably holds)
Bet someone‚Äôs holding some for her
She doesn‚Äôt hold any securities because that‚Äôs the right thing to do if you‚Äôre a politician.
Got to respect that. She isn‚Äôt against crypto though.
She‚Äôs the best.
Or she‚Äôs stupid
People need to get away from good sake of crypto currency.
It is kinda a currency though. Do you not have dollars to remain unbiased?
Lol okay sure. She's just mad she didn't get in early.
Meanwhile she‚Äôll be making speeches at 50k a pop at some point in her sure to be long career as another career politician. 
Would respect her more if she believed in term limits and retired after 8 years and went back to civilian life tbh
I've always admired her, but she lost my support when she did the crying thing over the Israel vote. Vote one way or the other; telegraphing your supposed agony over not doing what you stood for is worse than doing nothing.
That's because she holds Monero. If you know you know
Eth? This is the most uninspiring pathetic excuse for plausible deniability that I just passed my pants with contempt.
Imagine this logic applied to USD.
This is great and all, but would it be a surprise to hear that the majority of politicians don't have any crypto investments because they are too stupid < not saying AOC is stupid, since she is intentionally not holding crypto>
I don't even know who she is...
Hope she doesn‚Äôt hold other assets like gold, stock, real estate, or cash by that logic. Her policies impact the value of all of them.
Then she shouldn‚Äôt hold FIAT either
So no other investments as well? Cause that's dumb.
She means unbiased towards the IMF.
[deleted]
She will try to take yours instead
The reason she does not hold bitcoin is because she thinks cryptocurrency is something you find in a graveyard. (btw - sure her White as rice boyfriend owns some)
But gram and pap do probably. It's not like who holds them has their name stamped on them. Would they be hers if she gave the money to purchase them? Or if the keys they hold are in her house vs her parents house, or aunt, or sibling, or grandparents? I could hand my wallet to someone and technically they now hold btc. This whole article and statement is pointless.
crypto ""currency""
Lol.
There would be no way to find out. Beauty of Bitcoin.
Perfectly reasonable position to take and I applaud any politician that goes out of their way to avoid a conflict of interest, especially when it really feels like there's no repercussions for having flagrant conflicts of interest and no rewards (besides political optics maybe) for avoiding them.

My only counterpoint might be that holding no crypto currencies could cause bias in the other direction, especially if coupled with a lack of understanding about the technology and philosophy that gave rise to them.
Idk, I'm nitpicking at this point. 

I don't want politicians legislating about something they fundamentally don't understand, but on the other side of that coin I *REALLY* don't want politicians who do understand it and unscrupulously line their pockets with that knowledge. 

Don't agree with AOC on everything but she really does hit different sometimes.
She hold bitcoin
Does she hold any stock? Any mutual fund? Is she putting any money in any pension fund? Has she hired any financial advisor to manage her money?


If she does not want to be biased, then the answer to all above should be a clear NO. However, if the answer to all above is NO, then she is not managing her money well.
How do ""we the people"" get anything done? It seems like somewhere along the way our power to change things was completely taken away. So many people want the same basic changes regardless of party affiliation yet nothing can be done about it. The people who constantly bring up ""the founders"" to shove antiquated laws down our throats are completely ignorant of the intentions of the Bill of Rights. I feel like I live in a failed state. I'm glad I'm almost 50 now because I  don't want to see where this shitshow will be in another 50 years.
How much Pfizer does she own though? None of them are good lawmakers
Also, she likely gets paid handsomely from lobbyists and events
1 out of how many?
This is a bunch of crap. The legislators are literally immune from insider trading laws. And somehow she's above everyone else and more morally centered? Give me a break. They should not be able to invest in the stock market. They know where the money's made and it's not in crypto.
‚ÄúReveals‚Äù 
Is‚Ä¶ is this not just common sense?
She might not, but her partner will.
Not sure if it's really necessary but I still appreciate it.
The one who speak less about crypto holds more than anyone.
Respect lady. Now raise the minimum wage so ameripoors can stack more sats.
If only every other politician followed suit. I find it baffling how it can be legal for the people who have the power to alter day to day life can trade in the market. Obviously there‚Äôs gonna be instances of insider trading at some point as we have all seen
idk if i agree with this because this is kind of like saying you don‚Äôt accept cash as a form of payment because you want to be an unbiased law maker. imo crypto isn‚Äôt the same as stockholding, even if people treat it like it is
What about the boyfriend?!?
Mehh.  She likely uses banks, though, and she likely is voting on laws involved with that...
She lying
Also she‚Äôs smart enough to not waste time and finite natural resources to line her own pocket. She‚Äôs not a dumbass.
Doesn‚Äôt sound like a smart career choice sort of just sounds like a shitty financial decision
RIP
her son on the other hand...
Still has a telsa and attends rich peoples parties while acting like she is for poor people. But definitely down for politician not investing other then a 401k when in office.
That's a fucking champ move. Wow. Stuff like this still happens ;o
That's my girl!
Her loss
But it‚Äôs just a currency.
Ôøº Unlike Pelosi who gets a 69% return on HER investments. I keep meaning to buy the same stuff that Pelosi does, but I keep forgetting to. 

Back to AOC ‚Äî I respect her for a lot of things; though this post does beg the question: what does AOC hold?
""Unbiased lawmaker"" talk about an oxymoron
> Caring what pea brain AOC thinks...

k
Looks like she owns clothing and lipstick. That might make her unbiased!
Glad she will be broke in the future
Ngmi
I don't care if she dont own a bitcoin..but she's so fuckin hot..yum..yum!
Bullish on AOC
She doesn't have bitcoin because you need to be smarter than a fifth grader to understand it ü§£
This means nothing their spouse can turn around and hold all the crypto they want. Also i believe she should be able to hold crypto anyways. Why do you guys like so many rules outside of the norm?
Wonder how much her bf has
Doesn't want to be seen as a biased lawmaker lmfao. She's one of the most bias ones out there
She is plenty biased. Seeing how she goes the party line and the party let's her ""speak"" out to an extent but with nothing real coming from it
I want a pic of her feet
Just to be fair, that is why you have family.  They can invest.  I do appreciate her as a person and a politician and I don't necessarily question her here.  However, I could see someone from across the isle saying this and the eyes would roll.  Just trying to look at this objective.

So many things have been a conflict of interest and no one is held accountable.  I want to trust politics but it is nebulous...like religion.
Presumably she owns fiat.
She‚Äôs too dum to hodl crypto
She holds fiat so not unbiased
HEARTBREAKING: The Worst Person You Know Just Made a Great Point
Stocks and crypto are investments, sort of, a stock is manipulated, inside information is shared, stocks are given as a return for future favors. Crypto has none of that, zero, crypto can not be treated similarly to a stock except for by the ignorant folks who care to not understand.
How many USDs does she hold?
Are you going to burn your money while you're at it?
So she has eth right?
Note to self. Work on becoming a corrupt politician.
AOC: Holding Bitcoin makes me seem biaist.

Also AOC: Thank you University of California for your $117,026 donation. Thank you Google for your $100,796 donation. Thank you New York Taxpayers for your $73,637 donation. Thank you Amazon for your $62,212 donation. Thank you Apple for your $50,186 donation. Thank you Microsoft for your $44,785 donation. Thank you AT&T for your $40,674 donation. Thank you Facebook for your $34,581 donation. Thank you Walt-Disney for your 26,822 donation. Thank you State of California taxpayers for your $24,513 donation. Thank you Former Republican Tom O'Halleran for your $10,000 donation. I love being a biaist.

Also AOC (in her head): And by ""thank you"", I mean ""I deserve more"". And by ""not owning bitcoin"" I mean after a few investments failed, I gave up.
She doesn't,  what about her boyfriend though
so silly.
So does she also not buy stocks? Or have federal dollars?
Is she also not using money? ü§î I thought crypto was a currency like money... so by staying unbiased she is somewhat biased no?
But does she hold Rubels or Bolivars?
Does she hold fiat? How can she legislate on fiat? Based
Who cares?
Tell me you hold Bitcoin without telling me you hold Bitcoin
So she owns zero stock in anything?  Doubt it
Can she not own gold? She holds fiat currency. She should be able to hold BTC
I know the feeling. She‚Äôs just bitter she missed the train in 2010, just like me.
i mean as long as she doesn't hold stocks and thinks that's unbiased idgaf
Now do Pelosi and insider trading.
It hurts my head trying to determine an opinion on her lel
Her husband can still own it, idiots
*missed the dip
also, it‚Äôs a completely irresponsible gamble with one‚Äôs money.
Wow. She doesn't need crypto or real money. She has been re-elected. She has donors and government freebies for everything else.
This is good for Bitcoin. /s
I don‚Äôt believe that and neither should you. :)
Politicians thrive on every windfall.....good or bad. Without it they can't beg for votes to act like they give a fuck about your agenda all while actually playing both sides. They are the definition of shady.
Lol. They shouldn‚Äôt hold cash then either‚Ä¶
yes not that fact the 99% of crypto holders are men
She‚Äôs anything but
Real question, can some one point out what a negative aspect is of a lawmaker not holding crypto?
But her man has 1+ million in it I bet ... That's how all these politicians are, they say one thing and their spouse/mate is the opposite.
Only using the US dollar seems bias.
Drink tap water vs bottle water seems bias.
The electricity, gas, car, etc...
Tldr; AOC, only buys, Doge.
i don‚Äôt necessarily agree with much of what she proposes or thinks but good on her part
I don‚Äôt wanna be a politician, a journo, or anything that would get between me and my crypto. I just wanna be a degen and make plays on the market.
Nice try, but there‚Äôs no such thing
Good.  You cannot make impartial decisions about anything that drastically affects your personal finances.
Tell that to all Politicians!!!!
A politician with morals?!? In all seriousness though, I wish more cared as much as she does.
That's because she wants to regulate it!
üòÇ
Hey, that‚Äôs the combination to my luggage.
Doesn‚Äôt not owning crypto also make someone biased against it?
I heard the news that us is having maximum miners in the world.
Can we draw a distinction here between ""unbiased"" and ""conflict of interest""? Lawmakers aren't judges, have every right to be biased, as in they are allowed to base their decisions on their own opinions. They were elected based on those opinions, after all.

But a conflict of interest, on the other hand, would be if the decisions they make can personally affect them to such an extent that it may influence their decision.

Also, they are allowed to own stock, but are beholden to insider trading laws.
Bias has existed long before Bitcoin has. 

What is creating bias will always be in the system, cold hard cash.
I wanna hold her asscheeks
Bet she's holding some $Doge üòÇ
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs because socialists aren‚Äôt exactly all that commonly investors/traders, the funny thing is a lot more of them have stocks when that market‚Äôs inherently more ethically dubious than trading crypto. There aren‚Äôt a lot of blue and white collar workers suffering at the expense of appeasing shareholders around here.
Looks like she will do a good job, at least she has common sense
Bullish on lawn makers
You'd think this was be a bipartisan thing in agreement, but some people just dont like her. So...they don't like this idea???
What a bunch of horsefap
Regardless of how you feel about AOC, this is generally a good move by her considering she has the ability to shape policy around Crypto
I like the idea, but it has flaws. Like what if my wife decides to run for office. What do I do with all my crypto and stock? I'd give a very big FUCK THAT if I was expected to stop trading cause my wife decided to get into politics after we'd been investing together for years. And if I didn't have to give it up, well you can see the pretty obvious and easy loophole...
LMFAO That's rich coming from AOC.
>AOC reveals she doesn't hold bitcoin because she wants to be an unbiased lawmaker

How nice. Has she shed all the rest of her investments in order to be an unbiased lawmaker? Highly doubt.
She might not havy bitcoin, but she sure does have a cracking minge
Riiight
Yeah sure, let's believe that :D
Neat. I still think she‚Äôs a tyrant.
Seems biased towards USD tbh
I really don‚Äôt see anything wrong with crypto though. It‚Äôs sad that politicians are so corrupt that even attempting to gamble on stocks and crypto makes you look guilty. I wished there was a way to actually prosecute corrupt politicians, but party ties seem to be stronger than moral ones.
ngmi
ü§£ü§£ü§£
Honestly, based.
She holds monero
It's not biased saying bitcoins and cryptocurrency are a scam. Only fraudsters like that.
Holds eth then?
Meanwhile Lauren Boebert been DCA‚Äôing on SafeFloki-Inu
Probably good
Based and hyper-inflationary fiat pilled.
Lol, she is a human and a politician.... probably biased even if she didnt want to be.
I dislike her but this is respectable.
Nani?
I was waiting for the day when bitcoin would touch 100k.
bad for her who is next?
Solid stance. It should be the law.
Good god she actually said something that makes sense, this has to be fake.
~~i wish i bought bitcoin in 2013~~...Uh yeah i dont own bitcoin because i want to be unbiased too!
Damn, she‚Äôs so fine!
I believe her she could definitely come to the fish fry.
Does she own a house?
Well not being able to invest in an inflation hedge at all is a bit harsh but trading should be restricted I agree make them put it in a retirement account that can‚Äôt be day traded
She holds ETH and BLOK.
As a non-american.   
Does she has any weight or an impact on the party?  
Im Sick of all the AOC NEws.
How noble of her‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
Ok
She just can't figure out how
AOC? Unbiased? Lol, not that I don't agree with her on a variety of issues, but c'mon
XD
Good people dont make it sadly.
Yes AOC the unbiased lawmaker
Plot twist: there is no twist and she hold great ideals that many ought to learn from, but so many are focused on money, thus no one will learn.
So she owns a Ford she is not biased toward the auto industry or the Ford motor company but if she is aware enough to see the writing on the wall and participates in the future by owning a piece of it then she's biased?
If she wanted Pelosi's job she should start casually dropping the fact that Pelosi's portfolio has averaged 68% annual returns.
yes, that's how it's siposed to be... representatives shouldn't hold socks either...
Lmfao
so uhm how did she prove this
Please give me all your fiat.  Then you will be truly unbiased
Bitcoin is an inefficient database.
Strange stance when you consider she will have money in banks, stocks etc
cool
lol wut?
Don't hold dollar too, then?
Sweet, one step closer to no mo back room dealings and market corruption
I don‚Äôt hold bitcoin because I‚Äôm poor.
Well..... that, and bitcoin is worthless..... there's that too....
This means she's holding bitcoin, with little doubt.
She's an absolute fool. That's my entire contribution, it's edited because I don't wanna get banned
She holds tether
No worries her mom is holding some for her.
Wow! So stunning and brave.
It‚Äôs kind of nice for a change to see a politician try to not do a bunch of self-dealing when it comes to political decisions they make and how that will financially benefit themselves.
And if you believe that I have some magic beans to sell you.
Does she also believe she can't write fiscal policy or banking regulations because she uses cash / credit cards and banks?
It is not a first time when someone tried to low down the market.
I am once again asking for your DCA.
Who cares?
Ahhh,  that‚Äôs fucking funny.
I really don‚Äôt think one has anything to do with the other
All elected officials shouldn‚Äôt own stocks
They should be biased though‚Ä¶ towards morality. 

It shouldn‚Äôt be a problem if they do hold crypto if they believe in it, because the very essence of their chosen career path should revolve around doing the right thing.

The reason there‚Äôs so much conflict of interest is because they abuse their positions. Trading stocks isn‚Äôt the problem; it‚Äôs that the system that elects lawmakers is corrupt. 

This is like blaming a gun when someone gets shot.
How is that unbiased? Doesn't it mean she is biased towards not giving crap about it?

How can she make laws on something she doesnt use or understand? If you're not a user, you cant get the full feel. Its like how politicians think they understand poor people struggling.
Does she have USD? OR ANY STOCK?
politicians holding assets is like the jury of a court case betting on the outcome
Now do stocks.
Bull fucking shit.
We all know her family members holding BTC and other crypto for her
bet she holds us dollars
Whatever it takes to get her name in the media. She‚Äôs as bad a Schumer.
Great, another sub that‚Äôs going to be filled with people simping over double-standards Mchorseface.
Let's set her up with a wallet so that she is not too poor in the future. Like a gofundme for AOC's retirement. I'll throw in a few bucks.

Make a multisig wallet and give the keys to... Bernie? Naw he'll croak. Who can hold the keys?
Does she hold a house and other types of I vestments? Does she hold money, does she eat? It's a weird position for her to hold.
That's generally how we roll in Canada. Putting your assets into a blind trust is not required, but it's usually done if you want to get elected. If you don't there are TONS of rules you have to follow.

Here's an incident where a former Finance minister (no US equivalent, as he's responsible for the Federal budget) was found to have not done that, and he got hammered until he did.

https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/politics/morneau-says-he-will-put-his-assets-in-a-blind-trust-1.3639324
Does she own stocks? Does she have campaign donors? How can she be unbiased? What a dumb argument.
Hope she doesn't hold fiat. Don't want her to be biased.
But she holds Dollars with no issues...hypocrisy anyone?
No-coiner cope
Does she hold the US dollar?
This has got to be the most upvoted post of 2021.
Kind of surprised members of the house/senate are allowed to own Bitcoin. My cousin got a defense contractor job with the government and they ban Bitcoin purchases because of some blackmail clause since it can be tied to illegal activity.
Unbiased?
Lol okay. There's dozens of ways to invest unbiasedly
No bias at all, she's been completely transparent in her intention to support the government spying on, taking, and making rules about other people's money, the very things private and secure currencies try to prevent.
An unbiased lawmaker?  No such thing.  That concept doesn't exist.
Such an Idiot!
I wonder if she continues to stay away from corruption into the later years, or if her ethics hold
I just spit out my water reading that title.
Isn't she still biased because she doesn't have any.
The amount of people on a cryptocurrency sub telling others what they should be doing with their money is hilarious.  Aren‚Äôt you here for deregulation of currency‚Ä¶ or are you just pretend day traders trying to get rich quick ?
Will she give up all her federal reserve notes and stock holdings also?
ALL lawmakers should be barred from holding crypto. Its UnAmerican for them to hold it if you ask me.
She's a great elected official! More should follow her lead
You can‚Äôt spell LOCA without AOC
What a dip shit
She can‚Äôt spell unbiased
Unbiased?? That's laughable
Her husband does.
I don't understand that.  BTC is not a stock, it is not a business.  

Eh...
Nice try Charlie Lee.
Bitcoin is the most precious thing, we human ever introduced.
how does this have 22.2k upvotes? did the normies on r/all see it or something? meanwhile crypto taxes being bullshit gets locked and comments sorted.
The only time I can agree with her
When a group of people follow someone, people use them.
Good for her but‚Ä¶ why not do that with her securities too?
Nancy Pelosi hasn't giver her permission yet.
but does she use fiat currency?
Investments and holdings of politicians should be transparent. If there would only be a way to solve that ü§îü§îü§î
Oh good she will just stick with the normal slimy greedy shit politicians do and pay herself on the back for not being a cyber asshole. Great?
She has stocks?
Who cares
Say what you want about her. She does have some principles
Good lord.  She‚Äôs probably the most biased lawmaker I can think of.
I would put my assets in my family members name too, smart woman
any opportunity to ...
doesn't mean she doesn't day trade it
No matter what happens members of the government will always make money. You can't forbid parent's/brothers, in-laws, boyfriend/girlfriends, of members to trade stocks or get massive payouts. 
Or like some members, who's districts main income is trading like soybeans or jean, or whisky to foreign countries (China) get sanctions and lose money until they force the fed gov to not sanction them or talk about something. The turtle from the Republicans wbos state is in Kentucky is guilty of that with hard evidence but no one talks about that. 
Or the entire group gets hacked by Russia and forced to do what they want if they don't want heavily incriminating stuff released.
She can hold my balls.
I totally get where she‚Äôs coming from, but she‚Äôs probably more biased by holding USD, as bitcoin has no political agenda in the world. It just exists for use. It pays  people to work for it based on its coding.
I respect this. But I‚Äôm HODL
As a politician I agree. As a muggle, nahhh
Massive respect for her. We need more people in higher positions like her
Some people are trying to make us as china who uses for manipulation.
Why does this women exist? Clearly has no interest in the American public. Laughably silly, on a daily basis.
Sounds like it's time to make AOC coin
A lot of people like her had already tried to take down crypto.
she doesn‚Äôt have it because she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt understand the fundamental problems of place she works
Big statement.
So she invests in doge and eth instead
Finally something I like about her
Unbiased law maker? Is there such a thing?
Amin
And by doing that, she automatically becomes biased towards whatever other holding besides btc she has (whether fiat or other crypto).
Not trying to be an ass here . . . but most of my friends who have student loan debt are trying to pay it off quicker and not invest. That's what I did when I had loans. And AOC complains about her loans.
Respect üëèüèª
I truly believe AOC is one of the few if not the only non corrupt politician in congress. They all fear her because she's fighting for the common person because she was one and she understands what it's truly like to be in our shoes. 

AOC is the model politician we all need. She's truly making waves in congress and puts the boomers in their place.
Firstly, she's too stupid to know what bitcoin is
She also can‚Äôt be bothered by mob looting
Bullshit
that's actually a respectable position
One of the few who isn‚Äôt in it for the money, so no surprise she is so vilified by the Right.
Does she hold stocks?
Not investing in crypto current I get. But she doesn‚Äôt invest in stocks? Girls net worth is gonna die to inflation
I don‚Äôt hold office because I want to be an unbiased Bitcoin holder
Does she hold US dollars?  Or any stocks?
What a sap. Doesn‚Äôt she know the point of being in Congress is to leave it 100x richer than when you started?
No way of proving it so who the fuck cares, just more clicks with cute headlines.
Respectable.
But she‚Äôs all about that Doge!
Ask her what stocks she owns
When you get hundreds of thousands in salary and speaking fees you don‚Äôt need Bitcoin
She is so hot. I would sell all my Bitcoin to be her slave for even 1 minute!
I remember her saying on a livestream how she doesn‚Äôt have any stocks either so companies can‚Äôt have any leverage on her and she can remain unbias
I don‚Äôt want to be that guy but as the rest of her personal finances, as well as what she fights for, are completely in shambles I think this is more from a competency perspective than from an altruistic one.
If the goal is for Bitcoin to be basically the dollar, isn‚Äôt this counterproductive? 

I‚Äôm sure she ‚Äúholds‚Äù dollars in her bank account. You catch my drift?
Unlike other representatives, she relies on her salary and not investments or big money from corporations. She's not being paid off.
That‚Äôs like saying even though I‚Äôm a fish I refuse to swim in water cause all the other fish pee and pooh in it. ü•¥
But she‚Äôs holding fiat so she‚Äôs going to be biased either way
We'll, she has student loan debt and wants to have that erased. Seems she's only unbiased when it suits her needs. I'm not anti AOC, but just calling it what it is.
She holds ZERO stocks? Wow‚Ä¶.
Does anyone know her stock portfolio? I'm sure she is heavily invested and making millions...
And that‚Äôs when we learned not a single other politician made that statement‚Ä¶ really makes you wonder about the people we elect
So she‚Äôll vote against it probably
She shouldn't hold fiat either then by that logic.
She holds Doge.
Make this person president already
Almost half of the population believe there shouldn't be financial transparency aka the election of Trump.  What fools.
Isn‚Äôt not having it just as much of a bias?
Unbiased is bit of a stretch but sure
They could day this but have their children invested in it with their money lol
Same
Pro tip: you can still be biased and not own it. She might know someone who does.
Ummm‚Ä¶ her biases are elsewhere.
Not holding bit coin makes you biases to cold hard cash
Soon someone will come up with bad effects on environment.
Does she holds USD? If yes, then by her own logic how could she be unbiased?
Be the fucking change you want to see.
And coz she smart, so probably got ETH and upcoming ALTs.
Does she own any stock?
Respect
So no stock in banks, tech companies, automobile companies, energy companies too then I guess?
People get panic and start misbehaving causing market crash.
If she wanted to be inbiased she would put half her holdings into Crypto.
What the benefit of crypto? I don‚Äôt get it. Nobody accepts it so what‚Äôs the point?
Paper hands!
AOC being unbiased is like saying ice isn‚Äôt cold.
Wow, it makes ya wonder if this is why they really pushing the vaccine so hard TBH. I will go on and say it if no one else will and no I'm not an anti vaxxer
OOOHHH MY HECKIN' GOD!!! *SLURPS SOYLENT* YAAASSSSS
Clearly no one read the article lol

""Because we have access to sensitive information and upcoming policy, I do not believe members of Congress should hold/ trade individual stock and I choose not to hold any so I can remain impartial about policymaking,"" she said.

""I also extend that to digital assets/ currencies (especially bc I sit on Financial Services Committee).""
""So the answer is no bc I want to do my job as ethically and impartially as I can,"" the lawmaker added.
So she doesn't own stock? Does she have a credit card? Bank account? I see no reason why someone can't own assets and be impartial at the same time (or partial for that matter)
So she holds no stocks or currencies?
I like this, I wonder what Bernie Sanders take is. I know he fought to bank the unbanked in his last political runs and bitcoin would do just that with decentralized finance and providing a savings account to anyone witha smart phone.
Change the title to ‚ÄúAOC Reveals She‚Äôs a Dumbass‚Äù, if she does this to Bitcoin to be unbiased she would need to do this to everything. Cant vote on something regarding rent if she pays rent, can‚Äôt get an electric car/solar panels then vote on green initiatives‚Ä¶..
Does she hold USD?
These are the things she says whenever the camera is on her.  Eventually she's going to be caught by a hot mic doing some hypocritical shit.  My guess would be that she holds at least a single coin.
LMAO, yeah okay tell me another fairy tale.
Just she is trying to be in the list of whales and no one guess that.
Id go full bitcoin given the option and if I could convince the Mrs. It will get there eventually where everyone accepts it.
Then she have the bias of one not holding it
So this means she has Bitcoin
Does she hold stocks?
""I don't hold the US Dollar or any animal hides because I don't want to be an unbiased lawmaker.""
I‚Äôd prefer she be a powerful one
Bullshit.
Bet her husband does
How about because it is TERRIBLE for the environment?
And it‚Äôs super easy to say that knowing no one will know either way. It‚Äôs probably buried in her portfolio that is buried in a shield wall of various shell corps.
She has to payoff her student loans before she can buy a bitcoin.
If it wasn‚Äôt because of that the bitch would be loaded, like any capitalist would.
unbiased, lol
Us need to learn something from a poor country we know as El Salvador.
Ohhh please these clown want to tax the crypto
That's cool and all but i meannnn no one can truly be unbiased can they? Im sure she has relatives and friends who hold a bit of bitcoin.
But not holding Bitcoin makes her biased against it
But she holds the USD....
Bullshit!!! How do they go in government the same as us and come out millionaires.
Something about broken clocks comes to mind
She can‚Äôt figure out how it works, that‚Äôs why lol
I wonder if she holds any Moderna
I‚Äôm not sure which is more detached from reality: An unbiased lawmaker or AOC in particular being unbiased.
The more I see from this woman, the more I side with her. A little conflicted.
But she is selling merchandise like posters, apparel, comic books, documentaries based on her in politics and so on. Seems more like optics maybe? Or that she just either doesn‚Äôt understand it or doesn‚Äôt believe in cryptocurrency. I‚Äôm not buying the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to look bias‚Äù excuse. I wonder what her stance is regarding cryptocurrency and the regulations that politicians have already tried to push for. I wonder where she and the rest of the elected officials stand on privacy coins like Monero, Pirate Chain and mixers like Tornado Cash, Ergo mixer. That is where my concerns are. Privacy, regulations, taxes (such as taxing rewards and unrealized gains. The percentage that they think is ‚Äúfair‚Äù that we must pay) Id like to finally hear from politicians from all sides on EXACTLY where they stand on these issues.
Do people never refer to her by her name? As a non-american it took me way too long to realize AOC is a person (not in this thread, I already knew her, but before I knew I always thought AOC was some organization). Why not just use her surname like or full name in articles like with any other politician?
A lot of whales are waiting for the market to get crashed down again.
Allow me to say this in my native French language, fuck yeah!   Pardon my French.
I bet you she holds fiat.... not biased at all. Wonder if she owns stocks. I like her I really do, but don't be so pretentious. If you own stock in any company you're already biased.

Full disclosure: I'm making some assumptions here and only read the headline. Maybe I'm the one being pretentious.
Does she hold student debt though? Would make her opinions on student loan forgiveness pretty biased
If people aren‚Äôt clear on this: she‚Äôs eyeing presidency at some point. She is keeping her name clear and knows it‚Äôs being reported on. It‚Äôs a retrograde rap sheet. 

Like her or not. You have to think she‚Äôs coming.
I am seeing more & more of these devils here. That can't be good for crypto.
That‚Äôs why she holds xmr
She‚Äôs eth maxi
that's the only reason she didn't buy a bunch of bitcoin in 2005
She couldn‚Äôt afford her apt in DC when she started how could she afford a Bitcoin now?
OMG an honest person?
How does Bitcoin hold any more bias than usd? Confused at this response
But her trust does.
She probably just doesn‚Äôt understand it
Too late
I have bad news for her on that...
Get rid of the Tesla then
Btc is currency, does she hold usd??? No difference.
As somebody on the finance committee, I'd rather be an informed lawmaker, over unbiased.
Just pretend cryptocurrency is ‚Äúother people‚Äôs money‚Äù and you‚Äôll be fine.
Wtf ever‚Ä¶.. they all dip their hand in the pot somehow
Umm ü§î with that logic she should probably cough up her fiat then.
Êàë Á≤ó,„Äå,ÈòøÁì¶Áõ∏ÂØπÁã¨Á´ãd see all 2, QQ EE
Hmm but remains biased on every other issue but cryptocurrency interesting
I think we need to decide whether crypto is currency or investment.
She doesn't own it because they're going to legislate it...  Not crazy idea.
Now let's hope she fights for M4A! Medicare for all. Everytime she votes in favor of Nancy Pelosi or Biden, it's an L. Don't be fooled by pronouns! Everytime you hear they instead of he or her, they are winning and not giving us higher minimum wage or health-care for all
Kudos to AOC on this one
Does she hold dollars backed by us treasury bonds?
Representing the younger crowd , I thought she would dig BTC
Does she also not hold any dollars?
I thought United States is going to adopt crypto currency one day.
This should be law
AOC admits she doesn‚Äôt own Bitcoin, other crypto or even stonks because‚Ä¶she doesn‚Äôt understand investing, financial systems, money, how the branches of the US government work or how orange can be both a color and a juice.
She should hold Dogecoin
AOC is a nut case.
Why does this make me want to smash her tenderly?
*opens up her TD Ameritrade account*
 
Hmmmmmmmmmm
She is and always has been a complete idiot. She doesn't understand how economics or money work.
Honestly I disagree with a lot of things AOC says and stands for but I really like her. I am super liberal. Roasters have at me! But she is the kind of extreme we need to push the progression pendulum even a smidge. She is the young Bernie in female form I think we need. I used to hate her but I am warming up to this woman. She is kind of too sharp for these old bastards and I love it.
I'm sure she'd be unbiased even if she held BTCs. Integrity in humans doesn't depend upon material stuffs. If it does, then he doesn't have integrity.
But she holds...USD? Does that make her biased.
That could be good or bad
But their spouse and family holds 10000btc?
There are at least 4.1 million AMC shareholders.  During the August AMC shareholder meeting 63.6 thousand AMC share holders registered 67.9 million shares(that‚Äôs an average of about 1,000 shares per shareholder btw) . Even if you take the most bearish statistical outcome there are 1billion shares bought and held by retail and that‚Äôs not including institutions or insiders(institutions and insiders hold over 214 million shares) .AMCüöÄüåï
They can trade whatever just make it transparent.
unbiased lol
Lol she just never bought because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbubble‚Äù
Well it's Crypto..you don't own them, you either know a key or not
Sort by controversial doesn't disappoint lol

Lol I hope she doesnt hold dollars either
Does every thought in her head need to be a post?
That sucks my nut
But‚Ä¶‚Ä¶does she have any assets? I was under the impression she was broke. 

It‚Äôs a little less effective to claim to be working to not be influenced by your assets if you aren‚Äôt able to have any assets anyway.
It‚Äôs actually because you can‚Äôt buy Bitcoin using Twitter.
Same rule should apply to stocks too
She's fomo now.
These fools need to learn what a blind trust is.
She'll need to stop holding dollars as well...
Give it time. All it takes is a few politicians to win big through accepting BTC contributions and then everyone‚Äôll be doing it.
[Just in case you‚Äôre like me and you‚Äôve been lurking here too long without asking what Bitcoin and blockchain actually are, I created a quick and dirty intro guide. you don‚Äôt have to tell anyone you read it](https://www.makingamillennialmillionaire.com/post/what-is-bitcoin-and-how-does-it-work)
[removed]
Does this mean she also doesn't own any USD or take donations from major financial companies? Unbiased, right?
plot twist: she holds monero.
This should be law
Based and not a corrupt politician pilled
So that makes it biased lol
Well that‚Äôs intelligent.
She is the socialist but she gets over $200K in salary plus full pension from taxpayers.  In socialist countries like China, Russia, Cuba. Venezuela. Vietnam...Lawmakers only earn $300 a month...AOC should get the same salary $300 a month because she is the socialist.  üòÑ ü§£ üòÇ
Unbiased? I'm sure she holds other things lol.
What is she implying? That she doesn't want it around?
Nah she doesn‚Äôt hold bitcoin cause it‚Äôs too late to make any life changing money on it lol
Not having any could present a bias
Better get rid of all fiat currency then. Like the USD
And this is how politicians should act
I think lawmakers should be able to buy or sell anything they want. Just they should be made to disclose it months beforehand.
Yo Guys,

Can u suggest me a android app that shows the percentage profit / percentage loss of a coin, after connecting it to a exchange via API ( like binance).

Tried FTX - But it shows % change only, not % profit .
[removed]
If you squint she could be the lesbian from SWAT staring Samuel L Jackson
She's an idiot. She has no influence on bitcoin. It's way too big at this point.
She's stupid
Lol unbias
U can tell she a freak
Conspiracy: AOC is an actress.
This is the dumbest thing ever. Not sure what else to expect from her though üòÇ she owns money and stocks and is in charge of legislation for those, too. She‚Äôs dumb as a loose doorknob
That‚Äôs enough internet
This is the only decision she has made in office that I respect her for. However, I‚Äôm sure she has money tied up in big pharma stocks among others.
That and because crypto is a Ponzi scheme, I love how the new South Park exposed all these crypto idiots.
She‚Äôs a dumbass hoe. Simple as that.
Bullshit, she's a crook just like everyone else on the Hill
Ha! As if the Bitcoin is what did it.
Actually fuck with that but I bet she owns plenty of stock
-------
She's still a terrible vp lol. Sure she doesn't have anyone else do her investments.. check out her approval rating üòé
Maybe she‚Äôs playing 4-D chess
Which seems to be a prerequisite for
Getting elected nowadays
Fuck AOC
So she holds sologenic tokens !!!
Not a very smart thing to say, seeing as how thats the direction the financial world is leaning. Crypto is the future! Learn it, buy your ticket and get on board.. Or be run over by it when it becomes your unexpected reality.
Wow good for her‚Äî-not
‚ÄúLaw-makers‚Äù actually pass policy.
Wao.. is it seriously the case over her and the new is legit?

Nancy pelosi does not hold any stocks. Her husband does insider trading on her behalf.

The problem is, (which im sure is the case for AoC), is they pretend they dont have any conflicts of interests, but have their SO, family, or a trusted friend do it for them. And the problem is, it would potentially problematic if you force everyone the politician knows, to divest if they go into office. What if my brother runs for office, and I fucking hate him, and dont want him in office, i would be forced to divest because of that? Don't think that would fly in the face of ethics or the constitution to force people who are related in some way to a politician, to divest any assets. Thus, that leaves a massive loophole for politicians to get their SO or family, to do trading on their behalf. I dont think there is a simple fix.

I think the bigger problem, is owning stocks in which you are directly manipulating in office. Such as the semi recent tesla EV contract with the government, and the fact all Congress owns Tesla stock. Every single one, should be jailed for insider trading for that. Or the fact the government is pushing and even mandating vaccines, while owning stock in phizer (almost every single person in Congress has phizer stock).
Before he took office, Jimmy Carter sold all his personal stock, divert the royalties from his autobiography into a foundation, and put his peanut farm into a blind trust. The situation wasn‚Äôt perfect but it does inspire more trust than politicians who [insert absolutely everything about how Trump and his family conducted their business affairs]
What if you own a farm? Or a business?

Being in an elected position shouldn‚Äôt destroy your business. And people should be able to erect anyone they want, businessmen or otherwise. 

All you should do is make all assets public once you are elected. That way, everyone can see what you‚Äôre buying and selling as long as you‚Äôre in office.
Lol this would just drive away anyone competent enough to take these positions then, you want people who don't even save and invest their money to take positions where they have the power to make decisions for a country? Are you dumb?

If I had to pick between letting go of all my investments or fixing the country I'd prioritize  my self interest first, I'm not sacrificing my future for anyone, only people who would be willing to sacrifice all that are going to be no lifer minimum wage losers who aren't educated and competent enough to run a country 

The government should consist of people that are proven they're competent, wealth is a good indicator of that 

This is gonna make all the loser minimum wage workers who have only faced failures in their lives mad but idc you commies are stupid af, downvote away filthy trash
I think it would be sufficient for legislators to have to move their investments into a broad market index fund (not a sector fund).
No competent person would want to be an elected official if they have to get rid of all their investments. That would just ensure our officials were selected from the dumbest group of Americans imagineable. Yes even dumber than the current group.
All government employees and elected officials have to disclose this information and take various ethics courses. Then any changes to investments and businesses they own need to be updated and reported. There are lots of rules around it and how spouses and partners and their claims come into play. The problem is not that these aren‚Äôt being required to be reported on, it is just hard to make sure that everything is actually being reported correctly and transparently.
AMEN!!!
This reminds me of senator Richard Burr and Kelly Loeffler made millions right before the pandemic lockdown, selling much of their stocks having inside knowledge of the market.
Agree so hard. Otherwise you have ass hats like Pelosi running around making better trades than top investment firms. Hmmm... I wonder what the difference between Pelosi, someone who sits in on and/or chairs committees that decide the fate of the government's capital, and a small investment fund, a group that looks at trends to try to find the best investment. 

Money in politics will be why democracy in the Western sense will never work right for those of us who didn't win the lottery, come from money, or bought Bitcoin in 2011. 

AOC definitely isn't perfect, but at least it always appears that's she's actually trying to be an honest actor on most things. All these other hedge fund ball fondlers telling us that ""oh well of course I wasn't making the trades, I have an accountant that does all that"" can go off and eat a dick. 

Money, literally the most infuriating part of politics.
Yeah but rules only apply to Democrats
This should extend to a persons businesses as well.

Or we were all reminded with the last administration.
Yup it should be illegal to trade stocks when in office.

> How is this such a difficult thing to get done?


Money
I came here for this comment,true fact
Even at finance firms you need to state what you are invested  in for conflict of interest analysis. We should hold this view for officials especially!
Crypto is currency though. We don‚Äôt have any problem with lawmakers holding USD.

If we want to say crypto is an investment, how is it different from owning land? We don‚Äôt have problems with lawmakers owning land.
[deleted]
B/c then you lose years of appreciation. During your time in office?

It will lose out year over year 10%~.

To 

- Inflation

- COLA

Then said elected officials will be *years* behind on their retirement.

Placing an *influential person* in a **very** **vulnerable** position.

This is a very very misguided way to ""ensure"" any integrity in officials.

Maybe it will work elsewhere. 

In the United States, we don't have anything. Unless it's invested && created by ourselves.

There is no safety net to ""fall back on"". There is no ""supplement"" or anything paid for with healthcare. 

The expectation is, *for most*, unfortunately. Have enough to pay or not at all.
Lol that is so blatantly and unfathomably unamerican. Absolutely no chance at all that this ever happens
She simply doesn't tell the truth or is incompetent af
Bitcoin is an asset not a security. If it were a security is would be regulated by the SEC.
And if you don‚Äôt want to do this‚Ä¶.don‚Äôt fucking run for office POS
Shouldn't even have a blind trust. They should have zero capital interests if they're going to legislate.
This. I do not condone any lawmakers who profited off The covid downturn.

Fuck Loeffler, Burr, feinstein, Inhofe.
Mama Bear Pelosi entered the chat
Because Congress write the rules for Congress bro. It‚Äôs the single greatest failure of checks and balances.
As Noam Chomsky nice said: the US only has one party, the business party.  Dems and republicans are two branchs of the same corruption.
I know a lot of people simply give their assets over to their spouse and they see that as adequate enough. Wether you love them or loath them that'll still likely lead to a conflict.
I mean it makes sense, unfortunately that wouldn't solve the issue of bias. Instead of having it monitored and as transparent as it can be currently, it will instead be secret and underground.
This is wrong approach. She shouldn't hold investments to stay unbiased. Also shouldn't take salary in dollars.  Maybe just receive a salary in hotdogs.  To stay unbiased of course.
Lol tell that to nancy pelosi
I agree with this, though my province in Canada has recently seen a housing bubble and by extension a shortage of affordable housing. Rent prices have been skyrocketing, and landlords are welcoming the rent increases.

Our government officials are mostly home owners. They have a vested interest in protecting the value of their investment, and by extension they are willing to protect landlords over tenants in most cases.

My question is Should a government official be allowed to maintain autonomy over their home while they are in office, being allowed to sell their home and move, during their tenure in office, or is that a conflict of interest?
we need more public data about their portfolios ...
Same should go for their spouses and closest family. Both Pelosi and McConnel have enriched themselves by helping to enrich their spouses.
Absolutely and this goes for all assets including real estate investments, bonds and cryptocurrency- anything that can be influenced by Congressional decision. This is a non-story..
Politicians should, yes, but who's gonna make them divest? Other politcians? All of govt is paid off by the rich and corps. Can people change this en masse? Yes. Do they ever? Very rarely!
Unfortunately, politicians do WAYYY too much insider trading for a rule like that to ever make its way through Congress, especially the Senate.
The USD is also an investment class. So is real estate. It‚Äôs very hard to remove all personal bias from political decision. Even using a blind trust, the main asset class is still known to the lawmaker, clouding their decision (think owning an airline, and shutdown effects on that industry for example)
\*or insider knowledge prior to the public.
Blind trusts do not exist
The owner always knows what they have and control oh and by the way they pay the trustees so do you really think they don‚Äôt have control?
But they hold USD, which is also a type of asset, so she is biased without even realize it. These guy's lacking of financial knowledge is astonishing
I think the cronyocracy should be flat out outlawed.
Uh so politicians should put all their US dollars into a blind trust? You want to Britney Spears the whe legislature?

You're wondering why that's a hard thing to get done? Really?
I want it to go further. It's a six figure job. Give them their salary for life, even after two years. The tradeoff is I don't want them to be able to invest in anything or hold a paid position ever after. Service to the country means sacrifice.
Bitcoin is not a security
AOC is telling us that she is not doing this. She says that she knows where her assets are and none of it is in bitcoin.
Blind trusts aren't even that blind. A ""good"" blind trust will just do whatever you say and find a way to justify it... Knowing that they get favorable turn overs after if the investor is happy. 

Example: President owns a company plus $10m in the Stock market but not very diversified. They set up a blind trust to run the company (i.e. board of directors or their family member) and another one for the stocks (a new hedge fund or the same one). Any of the decisions made are officially independent be if it's reasonable the firm will ""listen"" to the owner.
It‚Äôs the political way
It doesn't get done because it takes money away from the people making the rules.
Bitcoin is an investment. It just fills the role better since it is decentralized and deflationary. I think once Bitcoin is fully mined and price stabilized it may become more common as a currency. 

If anything, projects like Loopring L2 wallet will be closer to currencies given they will allow users to easily turn fiat into crypto at a exponentially smaller gas fee.
You are asking a group of people that will be royally screwed by a law to make said law. Good luck with that.
‚ÄúHow is this such a difficult thing to get done‚Äù LOL good luck convincing people that they have to ruin their retirement plan to contribute to our government
You're expecting them to police themselves. That's unfortunately not going to happen unless you manage to get a full group of genuine people in office all at the same time. Good luck with that. Also you'd need it to go beyond the individual. (Pelosi's husband being an investor comes to mind)
Also whoever is the director of HUD should have to live in a tent in the woods for the duration of his term
*politician has left the chat
Fuck blind trusts... I support not holding direct positions but divesting into index funds is fine.
Agreed, our government is beyond corrupt
Sure sounds nice in theory
Absolutely, they are an elected official with the job of representing their constituents. Benefit and Protect them! She would benefit monetarily from her loyalty more then she could imagine.. These people think ü§î it‚Äôs a winning lottery ticket and front row seat to pass bills that no matter how big or small benefit the politicians
I remeber during a twitch live stream, she also said she believed politicians should not be able to hold individual stocks too, just index funds. She's followed through on that as well. Made me a huge fan of hers.
Because so many politicians are in place right now to make personal gains. Very few on either side see it as what it‚Äôs supposed to be and rather as a very well paying job
If government did everything they should do, earth would already be planet filled with utopias

Two words, greed and ego
Or they could just select a vanguard target retirement fund or just a basic S&P500 mutual fund or something similar.
They don‚Äôt have direct control over stocks. Explain exactly how a random politician can control the price of a given security? They should be required to make public their holdings and transactions, but they‚Äôre still private citizens like anyone else, generally regulations already are in place to govern conflicts of interest when necessary and across more people than just politicians.
I think a better solution is to make it so the day you enter higher office you can only buy stocks/investments in the same weighted portfolio that you currently have, with the only exception of having the ability to sell your investments for cash over a randomized time period in case you wish to divest a risky asset.

A lot of smart people are already disincentivized from seeking higher office, we need smart people and usually they are also smart investors.
Because thats literally how all of them are so rich. Its not just hard but impossible
The thing is, they're not hiding to do it. In most counties, There's nothing in law regulating these things. And why is that? Because they themselves are creating the laws and policies with blatant loop holes the average person wouldn't notice. Unless you're in that world of investing you won't know shit of what's going on in the background.
Yeah sure lemme just put it in a trust that my brother owns. Barring that lemme put it in a crooked trust and let them know about things before i do them
Do they hold direct control over investments?
While members of the SEC are insider trading and holding stocks and crypto. It's a mad world! You nailed it üèÜ
They should be able to hold investments imo, but he restricted from trading while in office. They are technically restricted from insider trading now, but obviously those laws aren‚Äôt preventing anything.
absolutely agree
Well‚Ä¶she doesn‚Äôt have direct control over Bitcoin or any security. 

She is a lawmaker that proposes laws. She is elected into office by her constituents, and ultimately the bills she proposes are voted on by her and her colleagues who are also voted in by their constituents. 

You‚Äôre acting like AOC calls up Satoshi or companies and tells him ‚Äúmake the price go up k‚Äù
Because if you outlaw investing, you will have even shittier politicians and more corruption (bribes etc.) what to run for office?? Fine but you can‚Äôt have a 401(k)  - not a good policy.
I think this is a perfectly fair position to have
Good bot
Fucking thank you. Tired of bootlickers on this sub cheering on politicians who hold crypto as if it isn't a conflict of interest.
Do Bots farm moons also?
I mean I agree with the idea in theory, but where would they park their money instead? An index fund?
I agree with this, but how far do we go with this rule. Family? Friends? How do you completely remove this benefit without impacting the people around them?
Bot doing god's work lol
Anyone who sees this. I need 10 invites on a server to win a giveaway.  can u please dm me so i can refer the link I would really appreciate any help out of the kindness of ur hearts!
Yeah we all know this is bullshit
So what does she hold? Theres going to be a bias unless she puts her money in a blind trust
Bullish on $BOTS üìà
Amen baby!
Fair enough
So who is she ?
The first thing I‚Äôve ever agreed with her on
Why is this bots avatar a swastika?
Tell that to Pelosi and her Husband!!!!!
It‚Äôs sad that this bot has more logic than most Americans
But what about USD?  Don't they make rules about that all the same?
Person sets up company with approved board members. Board members run company while person is in office. Person leaves office and becomes board member. See how that works‚Ä¶
Except plain old US dollars in savings bonds. Get that stuff back to a safe and interest earning investment. You cant beat inflation anymore. Its bullshit.
Good bot
There is no such rule even in the constitution of America.
Tell that to Pelosie
This is the best bot on reddit
She's right, but again, given that they're the ones benefitting from such information, there's no way that politicians in Congress are going to let such a rule be passed.
She holds fiat, so she cant be unbiased.

She needs to hold fiat and crypto and metals in 33/33/33, in order to be unbiased
So they trade mutual funds and etfs instead
She voted for a raise for herself.
Very well said and yes the members of the Congress should not be holding up the digital trading asset for sure.
I don't think so there is going to be such rule in rule book.
Funny about how those same politicans are allowed to trade stocks
Market will crash the biggest one if these claim will become true.
Tldr l: AOC is absolutely correct and should be the gold standard of all of our political leaders when it comes to conflict of interest.
This is how it should be. Neither should they be trading stocks.
Almost all of the member of us minister are holding crypto.
[deleted]
They should be forced to only realize long term capital gains. No day trading allowed, and if the sell any stocks or bitcoin, they will have held it in their portfolio for over a year.
I wouldn't agree with that. That incentivizing them to promote large business growth over mid size business. 

I would just say they would only be allowed to have index funds, sector funds, etc. There is still a bit of fishy stuff they could do with sector funds but I think it is a fair compromise.
One of the avenues through which Pelosi amassed her fortune was by having her husband make buys/sells for her.

Like the normal follow-up question after AOC said she doesn't hold bitcoin/crypto should have been ""Does your boyfriend?""
You are suggesting it is a good thing they be incentivized to further debase the currency.
It's called a blind trust. Trump was the first president to refuse and manage his own holdings as president, you can tell he invested in LL Bean and Goya
Politicians should make the median wage in the country the work. Investments should be in a blind trust.
The occasional GME yolo would be okay with me twice a year.
Of course this idea takes place in a *rational* society
I have no problem if they have a blind investment account directed by a fiduciary
[deleted]
Crypto IS the transparency that‚Äôs why they ‚Äúavoid‚Äù it
They shouldn't even have that. They are public officials in charge of overseeing this stuff so having a capital interest in private ventures- regardless of who manages it- should be illegal.
So then they just pump big tech? Lmao that‚Äôs not any better.
I don't want my representatives to have a financial interest in the stock market. Most people do not own stocks.
This won't stop them from making under the table deals with proxy traders, be it obvious close relatives (see: Nancy Pelosi) or somebody who nobody knows about.

Corrupt politicans gonna corrupt. This is why the stock market is shite.
This forces exposure to one asset class (stock / large cap stock), or stocks/bond mix in mutual funds typically available in 401k, over another asset class (crypto). 

Unless a person is pennyless, if they have any wealth, it is invested into something. Real estate, cash, publicly traded equity (or funds, etfs), private equity, bonds, crypto. 

In the ideal world, lawmakers would be forced to have their wealth (probably except personal residence real estate) allocated roughly accordingly to to the national average of wealth worth across asset classes - through some kind of a meta-fund.

This avoid undue influences of differential in exposure to various asset classes.
I'm okay with lawmakers owning non-industry-specific ETFs and mutual funds. I don't think there's really much harm in letting them bet on the economy as a whole.
The only way this will happen is if everyone makes political corruption the decider for their vote. If a political candidate is happy to receive lobbying donations from corporations, do not vote for them. If they do not divest or divulge all financial investments, do not vote for them. Every other political cause is just a distraction from the huge fistfuls of cash both sides are raking in as a result of political division.
And who's going to oversee that process?
APC‚Äôs blind trust: Yo, AOC! The blind trust put $1M on a house for you but We can‚Äôt tell you where it is 

/s
They shouldn't have a choice. No one serving in government should be able to hold any investments that their decisions could influence the value of.
how there is no insider information trade rules that apply to lawmakers is beyond me.  It is literally how corrupt can you get.
You would think this is basic lawmaking, but greed > logic
They shouldn't do this, but they do it with fake accounts
Can they own real estate? Basically what you're saying is they can't own anything. We're going to have to pay them a lot more and there seems to be no appetite to do that, make them entirely dependent on the state. Little kings, I think there are some negative incentives we haven't considered with that situation that may be worse than the status quo.
Correct if they would have invested more in stocks then it would surely give a great result on larger perspective.
Also they have inside Info for crypto too.  Along with basically everything else
Should they also not hold USD?
Does not holding Bitcoin make you unbiased though? Because people get salty for missing out on gains and then become opposed to crypto.
I bet she doesn‚Äôt have USD either. You know, to be unbiased
It used to be a law.

Till reagan
Kinda, but also not really.

That means she has all her money in banks. So she is biased towards banks. Just because we see that as normal does not mean it doesn't lead to being biased.

Banks will absolutely push legislation to protect their monopoly from cryptocurrencies. If AOC had 50% in fiat on banks and 50% in crypto she would be unbiased. If she has 100% in banks, that's clearly a conflict of interest.
She may not hold BTC but possibly holding some eth? Hahaha
Why do I think of Nancy Pelosi's Husband when you say that.
It makes no sense. She is holding dollars. You need to understand crypto if you are going to legislate crypto.
She may not hold any (although its impossible to prove she doesn't have a private wallet), but I'd bet good money her ""Internet entrepreneur and web developer"" boyfriend has some.

Its not rare for politicians to act in bias for their family and close friends
Or maybe she's lazy, or maybe her boyfriend holds her BTC.
OTOH she is still holding USD.
Does she hold any stocks?
""because she sits as a member on the Financial Services Committee FSC, digital assets are also a no-go area for her if she is to remain as ethical as possible in her job.""

In a way, she is inside trading if she buys and sell anything.
But they are forced to hold USD, which is also a type of financial asset.  Their view is already biased since they were born, they just don't realize it, like most of the people here
This is such a shit take. Bitcoin is not a stock. Compare bitcoin to the USD instead. Should politicians not hold USD?
She literally says this while waiting for her flight. Did you read or watch?
‚Ä¶ then they would literally have to not hold dollars as well.  I won‚Äôt hold my breath
AOC is literally one of the worst people in congress. Who the hell cares if she holds bitcoin.
Omg don't be so gullible.
They have inside information about monetary policy and the value of a dollar also.
I completely agree with this
Except she holds fiat so no it doesn't
>Wish politicians did this with stocks as well. That is something they actually have inside information for.

Having inside info isn't an issue in itself though. Most employees that work for a publicly traded company have inside info. That's exactly why we have regulations to not allow them to *use* that inside info for trading.. and whether or not those regulations are enforced is an entirely separate issue.
What she does is plain populism and demagogy.
It really does, stocks and real estate markets should not have political influence.
But she is just biased toward the dollar by not having some bitcoin. Either way there are potential issues.
There should be an amendment addressing the concern of all elected officials not being influenced by other interests.
Poor Carter had to give up his peanut farm...what the hell went wrong since then?
What makes sense can still be fucking stupid.
However, if she were to use a blind trust and the trust had some, I wouldn‚Äôt consider it as big of a deal. It‚Äôs them sitting in on meetings about new laws that will affect those prices directly that are the form of my frustration.
Yeah she only holds ETFs and thinks stock trading should be banned. You should only be able to hold broad based index funds in Congress and I agree.
This doesn't make sense, though. You have to diversify proportionally to become more financially unbiased. She doesn't seem to understand this, which is unfortunate, considering she's on the Financial Services Committee.

Right now she's (slightly) biased AGAINST crypto. If she wants to be less biased, a small fraction of her assets should be crypto, relative to an average American.
Wish we had more than a dozen politicians with integrity...
Tell that to Nancy Pelosi
She seems to walk the walk
Looking at you Pelosi
A politicians personal stock Holdings should be publicly visible

I wanna know which corporations are actually running my country
Nancy Pelosi is a stock god!
I disagree. They should be able to invest as they are people too, but maybe they should be limited to very broad and diversified index funds while they are in office
*Nancy Pelosi has left the chat*
A lot of things she says make sense
It seems like the more a politician cares about their constituents the more ppl hate them.
Yeah.  The only way they should be allowed to have exposure to the stock market should be via broad index funds like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund.  That way they have no direct financial incentive to prioritize anything other than the health of the entire market.
Shit I mean my gf is in big 4 and I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre just allowed to own mutual funds and etfs.
Pass a law that prohibits owning any stock while in office, but double their paychecks.  Let's see who actually wants to serve the public and still get to live really comfortably.
How do they have inside information for crypto?
I think if they own stocks, they need to announce their trades at least 24 hours in advance. Let the public front run them.
It makes sense until you find out she has a stock portfolio‚Ä¶ ‚Äúunbiased lawmaker‚Äù
She holds wrapped bitcoin
[removed]
her BF def has a diversified wallet from the looks of him.
She's bullish on LRC.
She would have my respect if she does lol
That would be based.
She seems more like an Etc hodler
I've heard she bought Bitconnect at top.
fuckin hell
She could hold Monero too and we would never know
Plot twist reverse, she is satoshi
She has to be holding eth. Those smart contracts are sexy.
She looks like a doge holder to me.
I see that you didn't read the article and only read the headline :)
Even if she holds btc who can verify that?
Even worse, USD!
Further plot twist: she holds AOC, an ERC20 token.
I know she will kep an hold on eth for sure and will invest more aswell.
I assume you meant she holds meth. 

And by ‚Äúholds‚Äù you meant she smokes mountains of the stuff.
Not if you were running R
Curse me for using my given name, u/BetelgeuseBox, on this forum
Your commitment to moon farming should be lauded. I'm not sure what your 674 CC score is but it should probably be higher.
Hard to believe any sane person would be ""mad"" , at this.
Yup, plus it‚Äôs consistent with how she views stocks, so it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs saying she‚Äôs against crypto or anything.
honestly she‚Äôs one of the few people in US politics who is most likely to appreciate the underlying reason why people are into digital assets (ie. it‚Äôs one of the few opportunities for the middle class to achieve financial freedom).

as a younger senator she‚Äôs also more likely to ‚Äúget‚Äù crypto at a social level too

edit: congresswoman*
Thats how politicians should act. They should stay away from the stock market as well.
*Looking at you Nancy Pelosi*
This is exactly the stance I *want* her to take on it.
I‚Äôve always been a big fan of hers not because I agree with everything she advocates for but because she has an incredibly large capacity to empathize with people who struggle while holding not only others but herself to high standards.
[deleted]
>I'm not mad at this. 

Why would you be mad at this? Why would anyone? 

Is your take away from this ""news"" that you should be mad at her for some reason? 

I think maybe you need to get outside more
Guarantee she holds S&P500, and you can bet her decisions as a lawmaker impact that. She‚Äôs got an angle here, and it‚Äôs not unbiased.
not mad? how understanding of you
She actually just thinks she missed the train, that's why she's not in.
She‚Äôs dating an ‚Äúinternet entrepreneur‚Äù. I highly doubt she‚Äôs truly impartial to it lol. She probably comes home to someone focused mainly on the positives and potential of it. Don‚Äôt put her on a pedestal, just live your life and try your best to promote change like her personality espouses.
it's almost as if most of her viewpoints are trying to be fair to everyone? wild
[deleted]
interesting but completely unsurprising
Polarized? It's mostly positive.
Hey. Corporations are people too.
Yes, that's likely what that means. She's a young person *with eyes and ears. If you're not holding at least some BTC, you're doing it wrong.

Though I get her POV. I haven't met many BTC or even crypto critics that actually hold anything.
This is why we need younger people in office. We have to many dinosaurs in office won't be open to new ideas.
No. I don‚Äôt believe she said that.
No you can't just assume that, how are you drawing that conclusion??
Bullish on $AOC
Who wouldn't?
No, this means she is late in to the game and won‚Äôt FOMO for now.  Can‚Äôt trust
She definitely intentionally left open that interpretation as she aims for a young crowd, so she's always going to be at least neutral on it. She'd never go against crypto. That would be self sabotage.
Human?

Believe it or not, biased
For real, I just want people trying to make a better country, not the assholes trying to get richer and other rich people richer.
Probably, in sense of conflict of interest.
> Hard work and doing your job in Washington DC really doesn't exist anymore.

It exists, it is just very much the exception to the rule.  One of the primary factors is precisely because it is a position so very easy to exploit via conflicts of interest such as having a significant financial stake in the legislation that you back.  IE - You can literally get paid not to do your fucking job.

The other side of it is that at least half of politics and voting is single-issue voters and legislation.  Look at what is happening in the Supreme Court right now.  Anti-abortion voters really couldn't give less of a shit if every other piece of legislation ran their lives into the ground (because it is in many cases) just so long as the nation could reach this point on this one fucking issue.  Nothing else matters.  As a representative, that makes your job INSANELY easy.  All you need is charisma, financial backing, and the ability to pound your fist on a table about the same fucking issue roughly 100 times during a given cycle and still come across as giving a shit about it.  The rest of your time you can spend enriching yourself and your friends and fucking kids on some island somewhere.
Honest politician is an oxymoron
She's one of the most ineffective politicians in Congress.
doesn't exist like her fake outrage over kids in cages

odd there's no more photo ops of her in parking lots pretending to cry
Yea, even if a politician held all cash that itself could be a conflict of interest. Politicians are going to have assets and avoiding any asset class or being heavy in another is a source of bias.
If you're not spezin', you're not livin'. #Save3rdPartyApps
She is heavy in Dash Zcash & Monero.
Every human has a bias. It‚Äôs not about being unbiased, but rather being uncompromised by personal financial interests.
It should also be noted that  Biden advisor Tim Wu recused himself from crypto policy because he holds crypto (despite this subreddit incorrectly claiming that Wu was forced to recuse himself). It was Wu's choice, and he took the moral position.
>Its not really possible to be unbiased.

Yes when people say this, they really mean ""consciously unbiased.""  As long as you're trying and making an honest effort, that's close enough.

This exactly
Or some form of a blind trust, as long as she doesn‚Äôt have direct control over her investments, I‚Äôm ok with it.
Still biased towards USD, since all those funds are valued in USD
That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so much false media against her
She's one of the only American politicians I'm aware of that looks even remotely suitable to hold an office instead of being locked up in prison or an asylum.
The more she gets trashed, the more I admire her frankly. I don‚Äôt even agree with all her views or platform, but I respect her and I‚Äôd vote for her. She got a grassroots start, she came from humble beginnings, she got where she is because she works hard, cares, and is smart, and she‚Äôs a human being. She very clearly gives a shit and is in it because she cares about this country. Even though I disagree with some of her stuff, I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs uninformed or corrupt, she‚Äôs smart, tough, and seems to be pretty consistent. There was some documentary I saw on Netflix that actually followed her a bit when she was running for her first election and it was really cool. 

Mainly I just don‚Äôt care for her ‚Äúcancel student loans‚Äù thing, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd also disagree with her on rent control and police funding. Just a difference of opinions on some important matters, but I can‚Äôt say a negative thing about her character though.
the reason she gets so much hate is because she‚Äôs not blatantly bought out by special interests 

like even if you don‚Äôt agree with her ideas, the mud slinging about her is because the ruling class will not tolerate anything that might affect their power 

you can replace AOC with bitcoin, it‚Äôs the same process. they do not want to give up their money/power
She gets that hate BECAUSE she takes her job seriously and wants to be effective.  Conservatives don't like effective politicians because effectiveness usually means changing with the times and we all know ALL change is bad, right?
Although I agree, it's also why her and her political allies never get win anything of importance. Electoral politics are an exercise of who can gather and wield the most power, not who has the most virtue or plays the game most ethically. They're fighting assymetrical warfare, and it's impossible to win that way.
Let‚Äôs just hope she doesn‚Äôt have a proxy trader like Nancy Pelosi and her husband. Technically Nancy doesn‚Äôt play the market, her husband does. 

That said I hope I can trust her in good faith that she‚Äôs being honest, but I live in a world where a politicians word seldom matches their actions.
The hate is because she actually wants to help the middle class/poor Americans and the millionaires/billionaires on TV don‚Äôt like that.
She‚Äôs one of the very few, from both sides, that actually seems genuine.
Yeah I'm a republican as the party was 15 years ago and I love AOC.

I don't agree with everything she says, but I fucking respect that she's got tangible reasons for getting to those conclusions. Need more people like her.
> This woman gets so much hate

Only because the right wing is terrified of her and those like her. the propaganda they crank out is fucking endless.
Agreed. If people want to disagree with her ideologically, that‚Äôs totally fine, but she seems to be genuinely trying to do what she thinks is best for the country.
I can't take her seriously ever since she pretended to cry about seeing kids in cages but was actually standing in an empty parking lot.
No, it shows that she knows how to pander to her base, just like any other politician.  What proof do you even have that she doesn't hold any assets that she is signaling would adversely bias her. Maybe she's not, I don't care. But at least verify. And since we can't reasonably verify; the most rational position is to look at her incentives as a politician (learn a little political economy if you're not familiar with how it actually works) and trust what is most likely based on her incentives.

I don't care if you agree with AOC's schtick, stop worshipping politicians.

This nonsense is exactly what crypto was invented to avoid.  As another user said, should politicians stop using the u.s. dollar? They could affect its price as well...

Politicians virtue signalling about not making smart financial decisions for themselves, should not impress people here.

She‚Äôs the Queen of word salads. Another cog in the machine, my friend they‚Äôre all the same.
she's a propagandist. and redditors slurp it up because she's a marxist.
[deleted]
She also doesn't own any stock and doesn't have more then $15k in her bank account for the last 3 years acording to her IRS statement, and that's with 200k/yr salary. Either she's lying or she's really bad with money.
Is just virtue signaling. With huge student debt to pay, a new tesla, expensive outfits and a expensive house she lives in do you think she still has extra money to invest? Also, she pay to her boyfriend tons of money from the campaign money. How you know she doesn‚Äôt own stuff using another person? 

Would be better if they own but anything they do has to be transparent or they lose any deal they did  not disclose in 1 hour. 

Transparency > Prohibition

When people can‚Äôt they find a way.
AOC and unbiased in the same sentence is absolutely hilarious
Who cares her idea are shitty and anti-liberty
You know you're being lied to your face, right?  She doesn't support Bitcoin ownership because she doesn't own any, not the other way around.  She's either too dumb to figure it out or doesn't have any savings for it.

She LOVES this kind of convenient grandstanding
Spez-Town is closed indefinitely. All Spez-Town residents have been banned, and they will not be reinstated until further notice. #Save3rdPartyApps #AIGeneratedProtestMessage
But she's entirely inaccessible even to her own constituents.
I don't hate her, but I have a feeling she's a bit of a construct. When I see interviews, quotes and other news items it's all very positive and polished. It's rare that I've seen her speak in any kind of live setting it's been a bit of a mess when I did.
Their beef is becoming grade school level. He's way worse than her, but they're legislators. Do your fucking job and demand censures publically if your colleague's behavior is so bad.
Shes legit a good person who wants to do her duty. Fact that she flew down to Texas during the winter storm last year to fundraise for them speaks volumes. Meanwhile Ted Cruz flys away to Cancun while his people freeze.
A long career in politics‚Ä¶? The worst possible thing for this country is more career politicians.

This is interesting and does not surprise me at all
>they're often into meme coins

It's because they think in terms of memes (and probably voted for a meme, IYKWIM)
People who live in a fantasy world, where DOGE is a booming project that'll lead them to riches.
The right wing in general is much more meme oriented because their worldview is mostly shallow contrarian hot-takes, so it's a natural fit
Republicans embracing memes over substance?  Shocking.
They're not thoughtful people. They're not interested in things that contribute to anything of value and care only about making a quick buck.
They are republicans and fall for glaring in your face blatant scams.
Sounds like they enjoy a good joke.
Welcome to r/CryptoCurrency
I read the article, it just reiterates the headline with more details. What exactly do you think people missed?
1000% APY on integrity üëÄ
Posts like this bring the political zombies from both sides out
She should hold crypto, as surely the aim is to crash the global fiat prison system. That is my understanding and ambition, anyway.  


We Brits love AOC.
Well she is one.  Listen to what she literally says she supports.  It's not a, ""right wing thing""; it's the definition of her politics.  He family fled Cuba because of what she tries shoving onto us daily.  People like you falsely call every Republican politician a Fascist or Nazi without understanding either term.  At least we read our History books.
World would be a less corrupt place.
How do you figure this is honest? Did you audit her finances? People are so gullible.
You only believe her to be honest here because you trust her based on your preconceived notions.

All politicians lie. She is no different.
99% are millionaires 
And 1% are billionaires
It is meant to be a currency, but whenever there is volatility, it can be treated like an investment
It's money.
same goes for you!

Bruh
Good idea but honestly probably won't have much effect. 

1. Most politicians are already rich if not well off. If they're not rich they'll probably be more easily coerced into doing things that will serve their personal financial interests.
2. Doesn't stop politicians from becoming very well paid lobbyists/high level employees for companies after they work in the interest of said company while in office. Very much a revolving door situation.
3. Other ways to bribe politicians that are perfectly legal before/after their term. $100,000 speaking gig at Goldman Sachs? Perfectly legal but essentially a bribe.
That‚Äôs a good way to corrupt politicians with almost no money.
This is how you structurally require politicians to be rich, corrupt or both.
Once money in politics comes in its very hard to get it out
Surely it would make a lot more sense to pay them huge salaries but ban them from private investments. That removes all the incentive for corruption.
Yeah, because nobody will ever volunteer for this self-inflicted misery. So zero pay AND you still take the brunt of everyone's discontent?
Can their campaigns take donations? Can they receive a salary? Can they have kids? Drink beer or soda?

It's impossible for humans to be unbiased, but honestly I think trying and learning about as many things as possible to understand the perspectives of different people is important.
I think it would be better to only allow one term and ban them from taking board positions for 3yrs after they leave office. The majority are career politicians who accomplish very little other than maintain the status quo and pad their pockets.
So should all politicians just never retire? Lol, better yet, should they just die when hit the age of 65? 

Can you people think before you post something. Like for real. There are a million other things you can do without fucking banning politicians from buying investment assets.
Uhhh if you make them live at the poverty line, no opportunity to grow financially and give them massive amounts of power, how in the hell would that not incentivise corruption?
Quite the opposite works in Singapore, if you pay them very very well, it attracts successful people who would otherwise never go into politics and reduces the temptation of bribery.
Any time you attack the salaries of congress, you give the rich members power over the non-rich.
Is there any country at present that pays its politicians in power the median wage?
> but this will never happen

It's unlikely any time soon, but I think it's a good goal to strive for

The counterargument for such requirements tends to be that if politicians can't make a lot of money legitimately, it will make them more open to being bribed. I think that's a poor argument, though. Politicians should need to be 100% transparent with their finances. We need high standards for people in power.
>	so they can be entirely objective and not be bribed

How does paying them a low salary (and a different salary based on where they come from, even though they all have to pay DC expenses), *and* taking any all other sources of legal income prevent bribery?  

Sure seems like it will just result in only independently wealthy politicians taking the job since they‚Äôll be the only ones able to afford to do so, or encourage bribery to allow non-wealthy politicians to make ends meet.  

Your comment reads like some hot take written by a teenager.
She also has come out and said she believes representatives shouldn't be allowed to hold stocks, for what it's worth, and owns none herself. Big difference from Tesla calls Pelosiü§°
I‚Äôm pretty certain that‚Äôs not her style.
Technically correct. The best kind of correct
First of all,  she is definitely biased as all human beings. Definitely can be influenced by the wealthy who might be holding bitcoin. And ffs she can be holding btc and lying. Will people ever learn?
Unbiased human is a oxymoron, however there is a spectrum of anything in life and the better you position yourself the more you can reduce bias. Anyone who goes to school to formally learn scientific research will learn all about this.

She deserves credit for actually attempting to be an ethical lawmaker regardless of your political opinions. We should be strongly encouraging this behavior not mocking it. It should also be noted that altruism is not the solution and that we must mandate laws that prevent politicians from being able to be in positions that allow corruption to flourish.
he-he, moron
It‚Äôs not about being ‚Äúunbiased‚Äù it‚Äôs about not having a conflict of interest.
She‚Äôs as fake as the rest of the politicians. Idk why people give her a pass.

The day we regard politicians in our own party with the same disdain as a tobacco executive is the day this country begins to heal. Unfortunately, on both sides, people will defend their trash as heroes.

I happen to agree with her stance, but your comment on integrity triggered me lololol.
I think you left the /s. At the end of your statement
People are responding to what she SAID rather than responding with a gut reaction based on shitty political ""Us versus Them"" team sports.

No one is circle jerking the person, they are agreeing with the statement.

You should try getting out of your shitty political bubble sometimes and be a human for a moment and then this wouldnt surprise you. Politics has given you guys fucking brain worms. Someone from the ""opposing party"" could say that crypto was a fantastic investment and many of you would lose your mind from the paradox of hating them versus agreeing with the statement.
Why not? Half this sub thinks decentralization is pointless
bro its reddit. nothing short of expected.
Well despite cryptocurrency as a concept being partially about financial freedom from the government, this is still Reddit, where 80+% of users are Democrat lapdogs, so I‚Äôm not surprised at all.
Is this a circle jerk? It kinda seems like AOC is planning on making new rules regulating crypto.
It's called brigading. They have to protect their qweeeeen.

Puff puff pass
While I can understand the skepticism and agree it doesn't remove a bias, I think it's a legitimate way to reduce a bias.
she's one of the few politicians who refused to take any money from big doners during her campaign. 

Most other politicians are bought even before they get into office
Andrew Yang is quite pro bitcoin and doesn't hold any. His reasoning is the same as her. In 50 years sure it won't be an issue. 

But right now he came really talk about how great bitcoin is if there's a potential conflict of interest rule and I guess AOC is doing the same.
>If they don't hold what's representative of the public's holdings, they will rule with ignorance.

First, It's about incentives.  Incentives inform biases, and biases inform opinions.

Second, ""the public's holdings"" is literally the S&P 500, or rather the total stock market. Your logic reinforces the notion that politicians shouldn't hold *specific* investments, only index funds, because then they wouldn't be representative of what the public actually holds.
1. who says that crypto is ""the public's holding""? I'm sure we're all in the crypto bubble, but the majority of people rather hold stock than crypto
2. Actually the majority of regular folks neither hold crypto OR stocks at all
3. You can rule fairly on crypto without being a bag-holder. You don't have to try every drug, to be able to make a fair drug policy. You don't have to have committed crimes to be able to champion criminal justice reform
You sound like someone who thinks former players make the best GMs in sports when they are usually trash.
I wish an actual socialist or marxist would run for a national office. Get them on a debate stage and on TV commercials. They would rightfully lose in a landslide, but the BIDEN IS A MARXIST crowd would have their first peak into the outside world.

Literally 100% of your comment is just based on assumptions that you just pulled out of your ass
Andrew yang doesn't hold any for the same reasons she listed and he's very vocal about being pro crypto.

You're just mad she's a Democrat.
Any sources to her being anti-crypto? She seems like the type to buy into Bitcoin but she's putting her job first
Tbf there‚Äôs a lot of white nationalist claiming to be Libertarians. Just look at r/Conservative
Why doesn‚Äôt she hold any stocks either?
Yes. I also remember that she didn't pay for a ticket and that she was invited and went for free.

I see that you forgot or ignored that part though. Just wanted to point out that context, as that is the reason you are being rightfully downvoted.
If you're gonna wear that dress, that seems like a bold choice of place to wear it. It's not like she paid for a ticket; she showed up to a rich people event she was invited to for free in it.
Given that you're still talking about it, Id say her little publicity stunt was extremely effective
The dress designed by someone who owed nearly $200k in back taxes and screwed over her employees by failing to withhold income taxes from their paychecks.
You mean the charity event that keeps the Metropolitan museum of art free for the general public?
She got a free ticket to an event that was attended by rich people and wore a dress that said ""Tax the Rich"" and you're faulting her for it?  


What does Trump charge per plate for his dinners?
Sounds like you missed the point of that statement.
Dude you can be rich and still want to be taxed that‚Äôs a thing, you can be wealthy and still socialist
Didn't she get invited to the event since she was a congressional member?
Yeah, that was fucking great, haha. It‚Äôs really refreshing to see people finally try to stand up to the disgusting billionaire class that dodge taxes through bullshit loopholes.
‚Äú New York elected officials are routinely invited to and attend the Met due to our responsibilities in overseeing and supporting the city‚Äôs cultural institutions for the public. I was one of several in attendance in this evening.‚Äù -AOC

Nice red herring. It‚Äôs like playing wack a mole with y‚Äôall.
Miss crying at parking lots and attending the most expensive party of the year?
The GQP hates her for being an outspoken ex-bartender, but thats about it.
You're missing that incels feel threatened by a strong woman in politics
She's a bit abrasive. I don't dislike her, but I can see why non-racist, non-sexist people who have no idea how the world functions could think she is a pain in the ass.
No politician is perfect
She doesn't.
She doesn't. Based on her public disclosures, her personal financial decisions are abysmal. $174k annual salary for 3 years and no notable increase in her savings or investments. But she's got a fancy apartment and gets invited to the Met Gala.

How am I supposed to think she knows anything about regulating global financial markets when her personal finances show she doesn't know what she's doing? And she's supposed to be a model representative for younger Americans? Please.
She has principled beliefs? What do you even mean
Maybe so which is why I prefer to steal everything I own.

Its not just a currency its also an investment. Stablecoins are just a currency.
It‚Äôs an asset.  Don‚Äôt give people the ammunition they need.
Actually I agree with her. It‚Äôs not like stocks at all sure but she could have insider information of laws beings passed that stays on the line of pro bitcoin
It's a currency AND an asset. It's understandable that you could have bias regarding crypto and want crypto to succeed the same way you want companies to succeed that you are invested in.
it isn't a currency though lol. In every conceivable way it is more akin to a stock than a currency other than in name.
My favorite part of mouth-breathers is when they make false claims that can be so easily debunked.

A quick search shows that she was the chief sponsor of the following bills that have passed the House and been signed into law:

H.R.4620

H.R.4207

H.R.5700

I like your anti-lobbying stance!
She was a waitress & bartender before winning her seat in congress in 2018. Odds are she has little investment in the stock market.
Wow got em
She's on the Financial Services Committee so she's going to be passing laws on crypto.
But it‚Äôs considered more political than those, and she has to be squeaky clean due to not being in the pocket. She has major enemies of the true big bag holders
I dont know, you can disagree with her policy but I'd like to see one thing that AOC has lied about in the past. You kinda gotta admit that even if you don't think she's doing the right thing, shes got good intentions. But feel free to link me some time shes been dishonest about something
While there a lot of people who don't like her, I don't think many will point at her as being that dishonest as at least comparable to other people in office.
Lol right??
No she‚Äôs just a moron with a huge mouth
I don't understand it. To be fair, the weeds get pretty thick once you get past the crypto basics.  But crypto really has nothing at all to what she said, just that her self imposed rule of not owning individual stocks also apples to crypto.

Smarter than 95% of the tripe that‚Äôs in Congress.  Even if that‚Äôs not saying much.
She came in second in the microbiology category of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in 2007 with a research project on the effect of antioxidants on the lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In a show of appreciation for her efforts, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory named a small asteroid after her: 23238 Ocasio-Cortez.\[19\]\[20\] In high school, she took part in the National Hispanic Institute's Lorenzo de Zavala (LDZ) Youth Legislative Session. She later became the LDZ Secretary of State while she attended Boston University. Ocasio-Cortez had a John F. Lopez Fellowship.\[21\]  
  
\[25\] Ocasio-Cortez graduated cum laude\[26\] from Boston University in 2011 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in both international relations and economics.

There's not a single thing about the facts of her life that would lead someone to the conclusion that she isn't smart. There are plenty of people in government who are below average intelligence, but she clearly isn't one of them. What a silly thing to say.
Not at all on both counts.
> She‚Äôs not very smart.

She demonstrates on a regular basis that's she's pretty smart. She also demonstrates compassion and empathy. You've demonstrated none of the three with this comment, and probably never in your life.
Okay but crypto is going to have a ton of regulatory bills written on it, congressmen investing in crypto would be a greater conflict of interest
It's a weird thing to say. Same thing for index funds. At some point you do need to look out for retirement regardless of position held. I guess she's a big enough celebrity that won't really need a retirement from a traditional sense.
Exactly
Yeah but she works for the U.S. If she didn't want to hold USD she probably wouldn't be fit for the job.
So.....what should she be getting paid in, exactly?  Euros?  Gold bars and silver coins?
This take is not based in reality, until every facet of expenses can be paid with crypto for *everyone*, you‚Äôll *have* to hold fiat at some point. 

I don‚Äôt know many people who pay their mortgage in crypto
I don't think its not always about being biased but i suppose it is manu times about what you prefer
Fiat is not generally not seen as an investment.
No wonder no one wants to fuck you.
Depends on will she be ready yo hold it and for how long she can do that?
lots of repressed emotions in that comment.

btw. you should look up what the black cross means next to the NY Times best seller lists. Since you seem to be projecting a lot as well. 9 out of 10 times those black crosses (which indicate bulk-purchases by big doners) are next to Republican books, which basically means that the exact thing you're describing is actually a Republican phenomenon.
What are you basing that on? It sounds like you've never actually listened to her speak.
Yep. She is very clearly actually invested in the betterment of the country/world. That doesn't mean she's always right or that she knows everything, but she's not just there to line her pockets like the entirety of the right and most of the left.
You love a rapist grifter that has a literal gold toilet that couldn‚Äôt make money running a fucking Casino.

Ah yes trying to not be biased is stupid. Cool, great opinion dude
You're probably an incel and enjoy sniffing your own farts. See how easy it is to claim shit without evidence?
Everyone has fiat.... whats your point
This. If holding bitcoin would bias her, so does holding dollars. And to the extent she could hold crypto, she could claim less dollar bias. It‚Äôs not like she can say she escapes influence by not holding bitcoin. It doesn‚Äôt change a thing at all. Actually, all it says if anything is that she has an anti crypto bias. Which is obviously bad, especially for a politician.
""commie"" lol

outed yourself as having no idea what's going on, good job
Decentralization through blockchain technology is meant to move every system (from finance, real estate, personal identification, to internet services and power infrastructure) away from a central authority regardless of whether it is the state, a private company or any single entity.

I don‚Äôt know much about politics so I won‚Äôt argue that those values are championed by any particular side or major party.
Blockchain technology is not a libertarian concept.
Tinfoil hat spotted.
You're describing authoritarianism, not communism.
fyi there are left wing libertarians
She works for the US government. She won't fit the job if she doesn't hold USD.
She would have to be the only politician in the entire country to hold that title. 

You really should watch her talk. She's one of the few politicians on your side.
Believe it or not but some people actually go into politics for public service
Exactly anyone who knows anything knows politicians speak out both sides of their mouth just to keep up public opinion. 

Amanda O'Connor is no better than anyone else and I don't trust her worth anything
The fact that the right has been obsessed with her shows you they fear this‚Ä¶
Haha. Sorry granny, I‚Äôd love to help but I gotta stay unbiased!
Squad power!
Ah yes trying to not be biased is stupid. Great take dude
They are the most ridiculous comparisons. 

Living in a house isn‚Äôt likely to influence housing policy. 

Owning crypto would influence the way you legislate crypto.
I feel the likeness to stocks is too strong. If anything, crypto finds itself being heavily impacted and manipulated by the political landscape. Same with stocks (which I personally believe should not be traded while in congress), there should be a clear line to avoid any potential shady business going on. 

One can be Knowledgeable without needing to buy any. Just as we've seen on reddit and elsewhere, just owning any does not make you Knowledgeable either.
Dude you can buy partial bitcoins.
She is a turnip
Click the article lol, she says she doesn't own stocks and extends that policy to digital currencies
Let's be honest barely any of us on this sub or otherwise are.

Huh??? - are you arguing that someone have have invested interest in something and not be biased?
You're kidding right?
$174,000 a year is what she makes. Not including any other investments.
It's unethical to invest in something that was discredited as ever being valuable?
Find out how many are vaccinated
Shhh you'll upset the hivemind.
She's been extremely vocal against the fact that Congress is allowed to do this.
Yeah no shit but she‚Äôs reducing her potential bias
She legally has to. Do you want her to barter for food on the forest market?
How do you work for the US government in her current position and NOT be paid in/obtain fiat?
False. She doesn't own any Pfizer stocks or any other stocks. This is public information because she releases her tax returns.
Imagine if you actually had proof.
She advocates for lobbying reform and laws against politicians benefiting from insider trading
It?
For having integrity?
I too definitely believe things that I have no evidence of
I too am sure of things there is no evidence of

X-1 biases is better than X biases. Also how would politicians get rid of those biases? Barter system?

> Meaning if anyone here plans on making any real money she's coming after you

I don't think you really grasp what extreme wealth looks like https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/

We're basically in the same boat as millionaires, if you can wrap your head around that.  Nobody who is ""living on a budget"" to earn profit from crypto is making anywhere near enough for them to be ""coming after you""

Stop simping for billionaires and oligarchs who are actually financially oppressing us in the bottom 90%
For reducing her biases? Great take dude
I love how AOC triggers you people. She‚Äôs right on a lot of stuff and you can‚Äôt stand it. Also can‚Äôt stand that‚Äôs she‚Äôs educated unlike the Faux News viewers.
Low energy post
For trying to reduce her biases? Great take dude
She's not married
She makes a wage, she‚Äôs allowed to buy things with her money. The point of this post is to say that she has no financial interest in the success or failure of Bitcoin.

Now, if she owned Tesla the company instead of a single car that would be a different story. And with her it‚Äôs damned if she does, damned if she doesn‚Äôt since I‚Äôm sure if she had some used gas guzzler people would call her a hypocrite for calling herself an environmentalist.
So would you be okay with Congressmen trading forex prior to publicizing a big trade embargo or some other news they know before the public? Also regulatory bills on BTC & crypto will (& already have) been presented to Congress. Is it ethical for congressmen to invest prior to these bills or vote & negotiate in accordance to their best financial interest rather than deciding based on which policy  is better?
Who doesn't?
What, do you want her to barter?
Lmao right?

Ah yes bc regulations have very little impact on crypto
> Politicians should not be holding individual crypto or equity names. They should only be allowed to hold index funds if they want to run for any political office.

This is the exact opposite of the well-reasoned position.

> It‚Äôs a position that you are in to better the county, not to make a successful career out of and to enrich yourself. 

Classic non sequitur.  Being a good steward and managing one's own resources well is not parasitism.

> Only way to eliminate conflict of interest is to make it impossible to have conflict. 

I agree.  Politicians and civil servants should not receive salary but only room and board; or, we can give them nothing and require them to spend part of their time begging alms.
>Bitcoin is not meant to be treated like a stock. It's primary use case is to be treated as money. 

Tell that to 99% of people who have Bitcoin, or virtually any other crypto.

I want crypto to succeed, but currently it's primary use is as an investment vehicle. Acting like that's not the *current* reality makes no sense at all.
She did say she doesn't hold stocks actually. The full quote is ""as a lawmaker I don't hold any stocks, and extend that policy to digital currencies""
No huge pensions. Do your term of service then move aside and go do something productive.

We shouldn't have career politicians.
No one replied to this?  I make a great point.  The entire post is quite silly.
She married??
[deleted]
Sarcasm right?
Because as a US politician she gets paid in USD? I see where you were trying to go but I don't think it is the same thing.
I agree to your pint. But your speaking through rose colored glasses with your context.
What would having a credit card or a bank have to do with anything? The fuss is lawmakers are allowed to have financial interest a.k.a, ownership, in individual companies for which they are legislating.  Imagine a senator who has 20% of their holdings in Apple, who then votes against right to repair legislation simply to protect their own holdings. Or what if a judge owns stock that would be greatly affected by a certain ruling in their courtroom?  It is standard in many positions of authority and influence to put assets in a blind trust so that someone else literally handles.  Doing so avoids the problem of being influenced by your own pocketbook or *even looking like you're being influenced*.  Maybe I am more cynical than you, but I see plenty of reasons why ownership would make someone impartial.
Exactly what do you mean when you say she ""does this to Bitcoin""?  Best I could tell was she simply said lawmakers should not own individual stocks, and despite it being perfectly legal, she chooses not to own individual stocks and extends that philosophy to cyrpto.  How does that make her a Dumbass? If I understand your last point, you seem to conflate having *an interest* in a policy with having a *conflict of interest* in a policy.
I doubt it considering she co-wrote a bill banning congressmen from buying and selling stocks.
Something, something Cortez she's running for president in the US

LOL.  Crypto doesn't do shit.  And it won't.
It‚Äôs amazing nobody even talks about crypto as a currency anymore. Everyone compares owning Bitcoin to owning stocks instead of owning dollars. Tells you a lot about the current generation of crypto enthusiasts.
[deleted]
Depends why you bought it. If you're living in America, you can buy CAD with USD as an investment or you can buy it because you're going on a trip to Canada.

If you're buying your tendies with bitcoin, then you're using it as a currency. If you're hodling with your diamond hands, then it's an investment.
1) stablecoins are pegged to the dollar and used as currency in deFi markets

2) the second largest crypto, ethereum, pays 4.5% apy dividend simply for holding the coin. It's called staking, it's a bit complicated but theres a technical reason for why it can occur and make sense
It's  a new class Asset.
It‚Äôs both.
Its a new monetary system that doesn‚Äôt inflate away. 
So it can act as a currency at the same time it increases your networth.

Did you know that US dollars are seen exactly that way in many countries?
Dollar depreciates much slower than a lot of third world currencies , hence, saving in dollars is a thing.
You can transact in dollars AND use it to increase your networth
I consider bitcoin a currency or commodity and thus consider owning bitcoin speculation. I invest in people and businesses that produce a good or service. I tend to avoid speculating on currencies or commodities that have value because other people perceive it has value.
What about the dollar?? That‚Äôs a currency and I believe it also gets traded by the Forex Exchange just like other currencies
In either case, a sitting member of Congress should probably at best have them in a blind trust.  Their influence can do quite a bit to both markets potentially and in some ways, when viewed as a currency, it's a competitor to the dollar (something most voters expect they should focus on increasing the value of).
Not backed by anything? It's backed by the most secure computer network in the world. You can't put a price on that, which is why it will eventually hold the value of the world on the network. Quadrillions in dollar tems.
To be fair fiat is also both.
Bitcoin is the pinnacle of currency
You wouldn't consider interest from staking a ""dividend"" considering that it is currency I think it's about as close as owning a dollar can get to paying a dividend? Semantics
> it's never going to be a currency with this fluctuation

People spend Bitcoin all of the time

> by design - not backed by anything or can ever pay a dividend

Neither is the US dollar... unless you bring out the tired ""but the mighty us government"", then we can continue this conversation that both have value because of faith behind it. It is just that the users of usd and btc have different reasons for their faith in said money
Bitcoin technically isn‚Äôt a currency but classified as an asset/ property per SEC
Legally in the US it is not a currency, it is property. It is like buying and holding real estate as an investment.
It is purely speculative. It will never actually be a truly recognized currency
Bitcoin is currently considered a security to the tax gods I believe.
Imo Bitcoin as it is today is an investment. For Bitcoin to become a currency the transaction times need to be damn near instant. For online shopping Bitcoin is a nice alternative to using your credit card. But for instore purchases or filling up your gas tank, Bitcoin transaction time might as well be an eternity.
I'd say bitcoin is an investment but some other coins are currency. 

&#x200B;

I expect something like syscoin to end up being the ""currency"" because it looks like itll have like 50mil tps and lets you take other coins as fees.  Bitcoin will just be a security feature
Neither. It's property. Like tulips.
I believe it is property, so yes, more like an investment than a currency.
Take me back Silky Roads, to the place, where I belong!

It works fine as a currency, its just still based off USD price. Just like Silk Road back in the good ol days. A $60 item would equal $60 worth of USD no matter what the price of BTC was. Kind of ironic really. If BTC was $3 the item would cost 20 BTC, if BTC was $20 it would cost 3 BTC.
The most surprising thing for me was finding out a lot of people I talk to about crypto still don't know how to use a wallet. They'll always talk about the technology, but I talk to them about swapping or bridging they get lost. And then there's the difference between a token and a coin.
Go to the nano sub and see what a digital currency should look like :)
A digital asset...is both
Neither. Its something people gamble on.
It's both an investment and a currency. I don't see why the two things have to be mutually exclusive.  
If I thought the japanese yen was going to skyrocket for whatever hypothetical reason, I'd invest in it. Would you not call that an investment?
what a small way to think of currency
Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt need a stable price just like Gold doesn‚Äôt. 

Bitcoin will never be currency. 

It will be a store of value for generations.
‚ÄúInstantly‚Äù transferable gold is what it is most resembles
Crypto is legally considered a commodity....ianal
Technically, all currencies are investments
It is a currency, but currencies are also ""securities"" (including USD)
It can be both. People flip currencies all the time for cash but it takes a lot of money to make anything on it because there isn't a lot of volatility to it.
I'm going to go with neither.
One thing to note is that price stability generally comes with liquidity and volume. It's the reason large cap companies are less volatile than small caps, and currencies/gold are so stable. It's also why bitcoin is more stable now than smaller cryptos and (although I haven't actually checked) I assume it has gotten less volatile over time. The more people trading something the more efficient the pricing is, an accepted fact in financial economics academia, leading to less overall volatility. Given this fact if bitcoin were to be adopted as a currency its price would grow more stable as the market matures. 

That being said I don't think bitcoin can work as a currency because it can only handle 7 transactions per second from memory and I don't believe the layer 2 solutions will fully overcome this problem. There are other cryptos that can handle enough transactions per second though. I think bitcoin is an investment, best viewed as like a collectors item or something, that only has value because it was the first cryptocurrency, it will always exist so long as the internet exists and there is a limited supply. It's kind of like a digital gold, though I do admit this value proposition is speculative. In this respect it's kind of like an inflation hedge, whose fair value, if one exists, under some basic assumptions, will grow as population grows and the value of money declines.
It's not a currency, since it is not in common use or accepted by most people. Mostly because it is more complicated than regular currency.


If bit coins were actual coins they'd be as simple  as cash, if one could create them from nothing as part of a contact they'd be as simple as credit.
Depends on the reason the person is getting it.  Just like any other currency.

It‚Äôs like, if you‚Äôre an American and you buy a bunch of Euros because you‚Äôre about to take a trip to Europe and are going to use them to buy things, that‚Äôs not an investment.  If you‚Äôre an American and you buy Euros because you think they‚Äôll appreciate in the future and you plan to profit from them, then that‚Äôs an investment.

AOC is talking about not holding them in her portfolio, I‚Äôm guessing.
Once it reaches high enough to be a store of value, it won‚Äôt fluctuate as much.
> not backed by anything

got some bad news for you about fiat
IRS declared it as property in 2014
Currency can be both. Just depends on how you use it.
probably for most, an investment.
investments and currency aren't mutually exclusive.
A currency can be an investment. Anything can be worth anything just depends on what other people are willing to value ‚Äúthings‚Äù at. Technically the dollar isent backed by anything.
Currency
The value of a dollar fluctuates plenty though, especially when talking about exchange rates.
Technically all currency is stock. Stock is valued based on trust in the company. the initial offering of stock and when the company selling more stock they gain money but otherwise they don‚Äôt get any money directly from stocks (from what I understand). It does affect their business in other ways that don‚Äôt matter here though. Currency (like the usd) used to be gold backed but that was decades ago and nothing backs any currency. It is built on trust now. This is where currency exchanges can make their money‚Ä¶hell there are trades who specialize in trading currencies to make money. 

It is for these reasons I think currencies should just all be considered stock as well because it‚Äôs built on trust and not true value or backed by anything.
It‚Äôs a currency, which has no financial treasury‚Äôs backing (fulfillment of debt private & public) üòÇü§£ I would consider it more of a CURR/COMM Currency/Commodity
There is a tether bomb waiting to blow up in the crypto market
It was initially designed with the idea of it being the ultimate transaction holder, so it would only function as a currency once it had fully replaced any other system. Instead of worrying about how much USD your BTC was worth, you would be worrying about how much BTC your USD is worth. Maybe it will get there, but I'm more bullish on ETH being that layer while BTC is the digital gold.
I'm pretty sure you will see what Bitcoin is pretty soon when the SEC sees what is happening at Tether and freezes it.  It will be an invisible paper weight.  An invisible paper weight does nothing and does not really exist.
I mean, people do currency trading all the time in the real world. As an Australian the last couple of years have seen some wild (not by BTC standards) swings in value relative to the USD.
Currency can be an investment.
A fool and his money soon to be parted.
>not backed by anything

Btc is backed by the security it provides. 

That fact that its decentralized and secure makes it better than you typical fiat currency which are backed by literally nothing expect the government saying that the currency is worth something.

It would be a different case if fiat was still backed by gold but that stopped being a thing in the 1970's and any country that tries to bring back the gold standard will probably get invaded
First thing that came to my mind when I read the title.

 Made as much sense as saying she shouldn't keep hold any cash.
If people stopped treating it like stock only to trade back to fiat then we can start using it as a currency.

I think it‚Äôs an investment in the future of currency.

>Is bitcoin an investment or a currency? 

Its not currency If you can't buy a hotdog from the street corner.  And if its not a currency... What is bitcoin good for?
That¬¥s a good question. I still see it as a currency, but it looks like most of ppl around see it more like an investment (A few weeks ago I bought a coffee using BTC...it was a BTC coffee, but they asked me If I really want to use BTC, or rather use LTC...why? ), but on the other hand - it was created as a hedge agains inflation, so...an investment
It‚Äôs a speculative investment. This isn‚Äôt even a question. It‚Äôs less of a currency than gold.
You know the answer to that
I think it‚Äôs both, which is why holding/trading it as a congressperson, IMO, clouts one‚Äôs ability to be neutral when proposing relevant laws/regulation.
IRS currently recognizes crypto as property. So an investment.
It's a store of value! It's like not buying a gold watch or gold rings because you want to be ""unbiased"" lol.

THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT OF BITCOIN IS THE LACK OF LEVERS THAT EXIST IN THE CURRENT MARKETS AVAILABLE TO POLITICIANS AND THE BANKERS TO MANIPULATE THE PRICE! 

The fact that AOC has said this shit means once again.. even the younger politicians have no clue as to what Bitcoin is. Surprise surprise!
>it's - by design - not backed by anything

Well, actually it is; It's backed by the security/immutability and democratisation it provides, which then again can only be achieved via the combination of transaction consensus via the underlying Blockchain, Proof of Work (respectively converting electrical energy to computing power \[hashes per second\]) and the decentralised nature of the network.
Many in Congress and the Senate moved positions ahead of the Covid announcement in early 2020.  Politics and corruption goes hand in hand.
>Nancy pelosi does not hold any stocks. 

If you ever want to make you blood boil, read how Dianne Feinstein and her husband - who was on the board in charge of  the UC's system retirement funds - used her position in sentate + his role to make themselves fabulously wealthy.
""we can't make things perfect so we shouldn't make them better""

youve bent over so far backwards to make this argument that you could sit on your neck.
TFA implies that spouses have reporting requirements regarding financial assets which Rand Paul's wife just flouted.
They mention something like this in the article: ""Those comments came after Sen. Rand Paul revealed his wife's investment in coronavirus drug-maker Gilead. Paul's disclosure came 16 months after the 45-day deadline set under the STOCK Act"". 

If you don't talk to your shitty brother in office about your investments or his legislation plans, there really isn't an issue.
Why are you ‚Äúsure‚Äù this is the case with AOC too?
Nancy Pelosi was your example? Fox News much?
The problem isn't that there's some kind of happenstance conflict of interest. The problem is when the spouse who sits on the board of directors of a company gets a no-bid government contract for something and then years later nothing is produced, the money is gone, and the politician's net worth is suddenly hundred fold.
Why would this be the case for AOC?
The emoluments clauses should extend to currencies/investments and immediate family. Too bad those clauses don‚Äôt mean shit as the last USA presidency didn‚Äôt give a fuck
> Her husband does insider trading on her behalf.

source?
Pelosi literally discloses their stock trades, because she has to, and it‚Äôs pretty easy to find documentation via Google, such as this one. https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2021/20019004.pdf
slandering AOC on a prejudice...(""Im sure is the case""), and then play the anti-vax card..
The solution, whether immediate or ultimate, is to ignore government until it goes away.  Crypto facilitates this like nothing before. It is unarmed insurrection.

Fuck the Bozos.
What? I believe AOC has divested from individual stocks like she said. She probably owns market tracking ETFs and us bond ETFs. Nothing wrong with that. That's what Obama did.

Also, why do people always attack Dems for this stuff in this sub when Republicans tend to have far worse and more blatant corruption problems?? Right wing media working overtime for sure.

Should be top comment.
WHY WASN'T TESLA INVITED TO THE EV SUMMIT??üëâüëàü§∑
Would it not be insider trading for spouses or family members though? Are they protected also from those laws?
The fix is that they can only buy funds or etts and no individual stocks.
Cmon, I agree with your premise, but your statistics are a complete fiction
Found the Russian troll.
I doubt aoc does this.
That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong. In Australia one of our previous PMs made his wife sell all her businesses to remove the conflict of interests. You either have respect for the public service, the office of the president and democracy or you don‚Äôt and you‚Äôre nothing more than leech. The problem most democracies have is that message has gotten lost and the system is full of leeches with no respect for what it means to serve your country. It‚Äôs fucken disgusting and disgrace. How much corruption are we going to accept before we declare democracy a failure.
Family, and SO, are not allowed to do transactions or contracts that are done with the public, in many areas of government, and are not allowed to be in positions of direct supervision, with exceptions reviewed annually, in many areas. It isn't a special situation that doesn't happen elsewhere.
That's just a regulatory issue, like if you get caught having others invest on your behalf you go to prison or get a gigantic fine or something.
>and the fact all Congress owns Tesla stock

is this verifiable?

>which im sure is the case for AoC


I'm sure you have no idea what the case is.

Why are you sure it‚Äôs the case for AOC?

If only we had some sort of way to track where all money is going...Hmm. It should be a public ledger of sorts. We can separate large chunks of the history of all transactions into blocks to make it more easy to keep track of. And we can chain those together to represent all transactions.

Perhaps we should call it a blockchain?
AOC really doesn‚Äôt have stocks, even if she tells others inside information, none of her money goes into the market as I believe she‚Äôs legally obligated to document where her money goes. Saw this video where this guy dissected her spending and bashed her for not having stocks and spending most her money on ‚Äúluxury lifestyle‚Äù
Assets should be made public, and more importantly politicians should be held accountable in cases of conflict of interest. Unfortunately around 0% of politicians are interested in enforcing that accountability because they then open themselves up to scrutiny.
>I'd prioritize  my self interest first, I'm not sacrificing my future for anyone, only people who would be willing to sacrifice all that are going to be no lifer minimum wage losers who aren't educated and competent enough to run a country

Good riddance? It sounds like you would be worse than almost any current politician (excl. the kiddy fiddler from florida of course).
[deleted]
No, I don't think that's what they meant. It means they could still have investments, but they would just need to be in a blind trust. Maybe allow the money to be invested in index funds and such, rather than allowing them to actively manage their investments while in office, which leads to the kinds of conflicts of interest we see with some in Congress.
Well that‚Äôs just silly, you couldn‚Äôt expect any competent person to run if they couldn‚Äôt even have an IRA or something
Literally no one qualified would run lol.
They could simply have their money invested in a range of index funds. USD shouldn't be a problem since its health should align with their duties.
It should be the law.
It shouldn't just be a fair position, it should be a legal position.
Needs to be a required position
Agreed
Well, I think they should be allowed to invest in a fund created by an independent third party and never allowed to know how that fund is invested, just that it contains US equities and perhaps crypto. 

That way they have a vested interest in making sure all sectors of the economy do well.
It is. Too bad we will never know for sure if it‚Äôs true.
This is basically the equivalent of saying ""don't buy cheesecake and put it in my fridge because I don't have the willpower to not eat the whole thing in one sitting"". I can see the justification though, because most people are weak minded and do not have the willpower or discipline to make the correct decisions when bad decisions are so easily accessible.
It is, though I have high reserves about her being unbiased
She‚Äôs too smart to NOT hold bitcoin in some fashion.
Hmm but then shoukd they also have no regular currency?
I don‚Äôt 100% agree with it only because I think a primary conflict with stocks is insider trading and corporate influence which Bitcoin SHOULDN‚ÄôT have given its decentralized nature.  That said, I do still think it‚Äôs a fair opinion insofar as I know not all crypto is as decentralized as we idealize given how many are ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù-led projects.
Wouldn't this logic apply to holding fiat as well?
It sounds fair, but the only reason she picked it, is so she can get more power.  And then do some crazy, outlandish shit on a totally different topic, but because she picked this position, people will support her.  I could care less what she does, just pointing out the obvious gameplan here.
If Crypto is real currency, surely the equivalent is not holding any USD?
Bullish on Bots!!
Bot doing god's work
Good bot
And they usually don‚Äôt even hold or just do so they can use it as a platform and pander for votes, and people here eat that up.
Haha exactly. The Bitcoin bros have been in love with that Wyoming senator and Ted Cruz lately. Meanwhile, they think Pelosi is satan for trading stocks. Fucking losers lol. I own a good amount of Bitcoin too, but it's so ridiculous the amount of blatant bias there is.
[Do you believe in spez at first sight or should I walk by again? #Save3rdpartyapps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/)
Yeah honestly I think it should be a law that politicians must put their investments into a blind trust when they take office, especially in a country with as much economic power as America. A single tweet could make a politician millions of dollars with the right trades.
My district will be **#1** in XRP and XLM! Shitcoins are the future!
But holding cash is also a conflict of interests in fiat's favor.
Question: What about politicians who hold USD?

Answer: the USD is used to advance the interests of the USA, in theory.
How is holding stocks different for a politician than holding crypto? Genuine question no snark
Every single politician ‚Äúinterested‚Äù in Bitcoin is trying to turn it into political issue which is horrible for Bitcoin, not because it changes anything about Bitcoin but because people in America are too emotional politically
bUt HeR dReSs Is ToO ExPeNsIvE *rabble rabble rabble
Instead they are biased towards fiat currency and the corrupt system which they control.
how is it a conflict of interest? if we want to see DeFi accepted as a utility, why wouldn‚Äôt we want it to be adopted by those in power?
I've never seen that sentiment, but I mean crypto currency is much different from stocks. It's a currency, would you also ban politicians from holding their money ""invested"" in USD or any other countries currency?
No, this is stupid. We actually need people to know what they are legislating. Besides, based on that reasoning, she also should not own a cel phone, computer, a car, or use public roads eat food. Government has laws covering all of this. She‚Äôs grandstanding is all she‚Äôs doing.
OK show me a politician who doesn't own stocks and bonds and tell me how they aren't biased toward the traditional financial system?
So, no politician should be invested in anything ever?
Holding government bonds is a conflict of interest then! Or dollars!
Conflict of what interest? Would prefer civil servants who engage in the things their constituents do. We do not need a separate class of political citizen.
Is it a conflict to hold fiat?
Politicians should just be able to hold index funds and should just be able to enter buy or sell a few days during the year imo.
:)
They know it is a conflict of interest. They like and want that. Not defending it but c'mon...that's like...the entire reason you vote for someone. They will advance *your* belief systems and advance you economically and socially. Its politics 101.
Do you not see the irony of a woman that holds up her racial bias like a trophy?
I mean, I‚Äôm all for them using a blind trust to hold digital assets‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt see why someone should necessarily have to miss out on the digital & financial revolution that is taking place right now. As long as their knowledge and power can‚Äôt be used for personal gain, I‚Äôm fine with it.
[deleted]
Then pay politicians more. It‚Äôs stupid that politicians are held to a higher standard without the monetary benefits of any other job that comes with that kind of media scrutiny.
Not holding it also makes her biased.

This is a double edged sword.
Funny thing is she could hold crypto and no one would know if she's smart
So she is saying politicians cant hold crypto? What about the freaking stock market then?
I mean wouldn't holding USD be a conflict of interest too? No easy way to avoid that though.
Okay, got to ask.

If crypto is supposed to be useful as money (i.e. the currency portion of the name), then it seems weird that having it makes it a conflict of interest.
and in this case isn't it a conflict of interest NOT having crypto as well? 

The same way you assume politicians might make laws in favor of crypto if they have it, you can say that they will make against it if they do not.

The laws should be made in agreement by pro crypto and against crypto people. That's the only way to get a fair outcome that serves everyone.
You leftist realize that a politician shorting crypto is even worse for you?

Brainlet communist spotted.
Anyone supporting fiat and not trying to dismantle the fed - are statist bootlickers. 

Those that want to dismantle it - will probably hold crypto.
So holding fiat and gold is ok? Owning property is ok?
I'm not entirely sure that's strictly boot-licking behavior but I won't rule it out
It‚Äôs an align of interest‚Ä¶. With them bootlickers
I‚Äôm 99% with you, but Lummis should get a pass.
I'm with you on that, except that I wish more politicians at least bothered to understand Web3, DeFi and the crypto ecosystem in detail. You can't properly regulate what you don't understand.  You don't have to hold any crypto to do learn about the ecosystem but it is easier if you at least held nominal amounts and experiment with the use case for several cryptos.
I mean if they are 100% of the attitude fuck crypto and make laws against crypto its no different than one who holds crypto and votes the other way. We need a robot overload.
Wouldn't this mindset make holding any asset a conflict of interest?
People are happy to have corrupt politicians if it benefits them.  Some cheer corrupt politicians even when it doesn‚Äôt benefit them, it‚Äôs very weird.
Yep, they are not cool
I guess holding USD would make them biased too, then.
Same group of people that burn money on a fucking jpeg would root for such a thing.
I thought holding crypto but politician will make it promoted.
I would prefer they did it but had to instant report it for transparency. If you think they don‚Äôt have stocks and crypto you are naive. Just check sons, cousins or friends.  About AOC with 50k college debt, a luxury house and a new tesla. I hope so so doesn‚Äôt have stock or bitcoin because she has plenty of expensive to pay if she still has money something os wrong.
I mean their owners can probably cash out them lol
They can earn them as long as they open their vault
Sure! But according to the bot owner this one loses money and it is more of a learning exercise. I‚Äôd say the programmers aren‚Äôt hurting for money though as they obviously have wicked valuable skills.
Notorious foot fetish model for 'alt-right' mouthpieces
They make the rules, that's why.
Wait is this legit? If so thats actually really cool and although CNBC can be meh on occasion makes me like them a bit more
Because politicians write the laws.
This right here.
I imagine any legislation that takes money out of they're pockets wouldn't stand a chance. Don't they still yay or nay they're own salaries?
Some ETFs are still heavily influenced by Congress, I don‚Äôt see how that help much.
[deleted]
Seriously? Cnbc staff can't own stocks? I feel that can't be true to kramer the clown.

Any source for that?
AOC is on the financial services committee as well. Pretty much a ticket to become a quick millionaire. She doesn't hold any stocks. I understand people have their issues with politicians, but the woman seems like her intentions are honest.
I thought some of them talk about their positions or disclose their positions I'm pretty sure they can own some?
Which makes AOC all the more admirable. If only there were more like her. She's not perfect (we shouldn't expect *perfection* in politicians), but she's in the top tier of politicians when it comes to decency and integrity.
Because they *are* the government.
Follow? I bet they don't even know what the rules are lmao.
It's how the government pays them if we are being completely honest
Most employees of publicly traded companies are subject to similar rules against day trading - no issue with taking short-term gains (unless you‚Äôre an exec with lockup periods), but you can only buy and sell within a certain number of days after quarterly filings.
This is an idea. But still could lead them to lobbying the fed for more overall stock inflation / higher spending
This. Similar to company execs they should only be allowed to make scheduled sales of stocks. They‚Äôre the ‚Äúexecutives‚Äù of our economy, anyway.
Fuck that, they shouldn't be able to hold anything.

If they have stocks they are _materially incentivized_ to make laws to increase their own wealth.  

I'm sick of everyone's takes on corruption that ""well it's fine so long as they don't get _too_ corrupt""

Block them from all future earnings and give them a pension indexed to the median earning for their represented district.  Incentivize them to serve the public.
Nancy Pelosi will be sending a hitman after you for suggesting that.
How do you apply the rules to ""they"", anyway? If you make stocks or day trading illegal, they'll offload it to trusts, business entities, family members, and whatever other loopholes exist. They'll gather all the profits externally while office is held and the money will be transferred back after they leave.

To get money out of politics would require somehow enforcing that elected officials be true public servants -- that they have no access to *any* funding outside of their taxpayer-backed salary. If that could somehow be enforced (which it can't be), politics would only attract those who are in it for the right reasons.

Instead, we've got the current capitalist hellscape solution where every lawmaker with any semblance of power is a millionaire and completely disconnected from the lives of the people they supposedly represent.
Yeah, even with a blind trust they could still be persuaded to just keep pushing more money into the stock market with cheap credit. But it would definitely still be better than the current situation where members on both sides can and do insider trading legally.
I mean, you could have them be stuck with total market funds if you want them to promote the economy in general. Still not perfect as your local stores aren't in the total market fund, but better than just the S&P500. It would still have good growth, but avoid the conflicts of interest.
Most index funds are composed of *large* cap companies.
That's a pretty lopsided argument, there is a world of difference between dating someone and being married to them.
I disagree. I believe politicians should be paid far above the median wage. Low wages with high power encourage corruption, but they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to trade stocks or crypto. I‚Äôm okay with them investing in index funds though.
They can only buy far OTM SPY leaps
I mean I'd take that at this point over what we have.
I'm quite sure an ethics committee wouldn't be that hard to organize. Assuming we actually wanted to keep things above board, it wouldn't be that hard to monitor.
In my opinion they should just have a selection similar to an American‚Äôs 401k plan. Just simple, broad market index funds that represent the overall US and global markets.
Not only they hold investments, they also receive money to represent company's interests
There was an effort over the past few years to force all lawmakers to move their publicly traded assets to index funds upon election. Not sure what happened with that.
That makes sense? They should make that a law. Oh wait‚Ä¶ politicians nowadays rarely police themselves.
If you can't use your political power to further your own personal wealth as a politician then what's the point? You expect them to *serve* the public? Like some sort of public servant? Don't be asinine.
Definitely. This should be illegal honestly.
With stocks it would be easy, but it's hard to forbid a politician from owning different currencies
I mean they should be allowed to have investments, as some point, many of them won't be politicians anymore. They should be required to have their investments professionally managed and to a higher degree of scrutiny. They should also only be able to do indexed funds or something like that.
They made Jimmy sell his peanut farm, they should have made every congressperson who got rich off of the pandemic do the same upon taking the oath of office.
Or they can only hold a world index that they can't sell and can only buy automatically once a month.
Yes, that‚Äôs why some politicians such as Jimmy Carter gave up his peanut farm to a third party that ended up losing money with the farm just to avoid conflict of interest as the president.

We the people should at least make an amendment that politicians in high office cannot own any investments that they can have direct influence over, but this is difficult to enforce since people would just tell their family members what to buy or sell.
That's the reason congress is allowed some level of insider trading.  If they are allowed to sell their investments before a critical decision/law is made, they can make an uninfluenced/unbiased decision, supposedly.
[deleted]
Not holding investments could effect their decisions just the same though. As a non market participant, what motivation do they have?
Where do you draw the line?

If someone owns a retirement account, should they not be able to serve in government?

If someone owns a house, should they not be able serve?

If someone owns cryptocurrency should they not be able to serve?

What level of government is it okay to serve with those things? City level? State level? Nationally?
They shouldn't, but they do. And she chooses not to. Good for her. That is the definition of integrity.
This 1 thousand times.
They should because then nobody would be able to run. How would someone save for retirement?
Yeah, except they already use their spouses‚Ä¶ CoughNancyPelosiCough
[If you're not spezin', you're not livin'. #Save3rdPartyApps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/)
This sounds good on paper, but how does this  work IRL. They divest all investments public and private prior to entering office? That's how we end up with a bunch of AOC bartender politician clones, no one with any meaningful amount of success would run for office.

Surely there should be more rules in place to prohibit active trading of securities that they may have inside knowledge on, but completely divesting all investments is dumb. What are they to hold it in USD? TBH when I hear a politician make a comment like this its purely to appeal to the dumb majority of Americans that is not thinking about their financial future and is just hoping it all works out.
You can't tell people they can't own stuff. They should just have to abstain from voting on it or sponsoring bills related to it.
Tell that to the banks, unions, and other institutions that fund their (and her's) campaigns in exchange for partial treatment. Teachers unions for example; Teaching our kids how terrible it is to be white while stuffing their pockets with union securities made possible by democrat elites, in exchange for their votes. Maybe that dumb waitress should look at her own party instead of fckin up crypto for the average taxpayer. I don't think investing in American businesses is hardly the cancer eating away at American integrity is her ahha moment.
Then we wouldn‚Äôt have anyone with an iq over 80 in Congress
Or at least require some sort of blind trust with their financial managers.
But then how would they get rich?
I think this is the case in China. Even public servants can't do things like play golf because it's seen as a corrupt activity
They also need to be barred from taking jobs at companies they were tasked with regulating.
Agreed. As it stands, they have access to information/resources that puts them in a position of power in many ways, but the financial power they have like this above normal civilians is insane. 

Public service was never supposed to be a cushy career-long ride. We need to at least *try* to remove some of that cushiness to their seats.

Maybe later if Congress proves that they can act within the public's interest and not abuse their power, they can have stocks back. Maybe.
does it make sense? I think this incentivizes them to just expand the size of government where they lie at the top, rather than allowing others to create wealth.
You get a blind trust! You get a blind trust! ***Everyone gets a blind trust!***
That's such a radical point of view if you look the current state of politics xD

I hope your vision comes true my man, that would be the start of human utopia. Can you believe in a world where we could actually trust our politicians to have no outside agenda besides the policy they publicly support? I'm for it.
Well they did have a vote on banning politicians from owning stock..that didn't go well
It‚Äôs insane how well politicians do in the market.  Their portfolios regularly blow away the performance of the market in general and even portfolios that mimic politician‚Äôs trades don‚Äôt even do as well due to the time delay.  

The only way to do what they do is to be some kind of prodigy or cheat.
It‚Äôs amazing this is even a discussion we have to have. Why the fuck do people think it‚Äôs a good idea to have people in office with vested interests in parts of laws and bills they sign??????
Nah they shud be only allowed to hold index funds of their own country
I disagree- they should hold total US market ETFs
Their investments should go into a blind trust.  They should have to forgo other sources of income.  Any attempt to circumvent this by hiding income or directing it to a relative should be met with the strictest legal penalties.

Like several years of prison ‚Äústrict‚Äù.
Aren't Cryptos just a form of currency? Does that mean politicians shouldn't be allowed to have US currency, their decisions can definitely make the value of the US dollar rise and fall.

I don't see how holding crypto is any different to holding any other currency.
But there‚Äôs inherent bias by not holding assets as well. It‚Äôs a tricky subject and integrity and bias can blur

They all have family and friends and loved ones that have various views. Not to mention political bias. 

It‚Äôs not a flawless system but none of them are.
Random Joe‚Äôs who work for the federal government can‚Äôt hold a bunch of types of stocks (most notably energy or anything even remotely related to their agency‚Äôs field) and these fucks can trade anything they want with insider information.

It‚Äôs infuriating
I disagree. Index funds are fine. Index funds are essential to anyone who plans to retire. Excluding politicians from investing will lead them to take money from outside sources
Those same lawmakers would have to create a law to penalize themselves.  That's the problem with pretty much any idea folks come up with for reigning in the self-interest (term limits, campaign finance reform, you name it)...the very people exploiting and profiting from the broken system are the ones tasked with fixing it.
>how there is no insider information trade rules that apply to lawmakers is beyond me

There is. It's called the Stock Act.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK\_Act
There are, but they aren't enforced.
[removed]
They were insider trading so much it was only logical for them to make it legal for them to do.
Its human nature, sorry to say.
It would be but cynics/ignorant/malicious people insist that all politicians are the same, a destructive and factually incorrect statement that only caters to the shitty side. I could say this without knowledge of the two parties, this is just how life works: a mud slinging contest always favors the pig.

We need to move past ideology. Only one party has multiple politicians who truly want to fix some of these problems, the problem is that anyone who has been grounded in reality since 9/11 is well aware of this.
This. And for that matter, they couldn‚Äôt hold dollars either. This is a ridiculous idea.
Finally a sensical comment in this thread. Preach, I swear its like this post got taken over by a bunch of kids still in Jr High/High school. Making them sell individual positions and put their money into index funds/treasury instruments makes some sense, but complete divesting of everything is just silly and pointless and will prevent anyone with half a brain from running for office. And like you mention how granular would this get? Primary residences are ok but not secondary? or rentals? LOL even these peeps Lord and Saviour Bernie Sanders would have to sell shit.
Ahh now we know who bought that $8k worth of Shiba before it pumped which turned into billions.
This is why I don't hold fiat, I want to remain impartial.
That was my thought too. Doesn‚Äôt holding fiat mean she‚Äôs biased in favor of the Federal Reserve? Makes no sense unless you view Bitcoin like a stock. Which it isn‚Äôt.
Index funds is all they should be able to invest in IMO.

When they finally release a crypto ETF, they can invest in that if they wanted too but I think it‚Äôs a good idea not to let them invest in any certain coin at this still early level of adoption
They've got to hold _something_, and at least USD is related to their performance.
should they not hold the essential legal currency required to function in their nation? always one in every comments section..
Some people. Not all people. AOC doesn‚Äôt strike me as a ‚Äúwhen lambo‚Äù kinda person. Nothing against lambos.
I'd be more concerned with politicians regulating assets they don't have any understanding of.
It‚Äôs not about being unbiased, per se, it‚Äôs about being uncompromised by personal financial interests.
That's a false dichotomy imo. Having money in bitcoin means you're invested in bitcoin, but having money in the bank doesn't mean you're invested in the bank. Different concepts. Lots of people have money in the bank and simultaneously hate their bank. People who hate bitcoin don't tend to have money in it though.
what in the world are you talking about
How would someone survive without holding some type of fiat? You act like everyone can pay rent with crypto lol
Fun fact: we'll never know if she holds Monero because it's *Monero*.
You are technically correct... the best *kind* of correct.

It would most likely get you more votes especially if you were spewing QAnon nonsense.
Well the problem is that ""sane"" is not so common now lol
That's my thought but Crypto Twitter is all talking about how she's NGMI and an idiot for not abusing her position for personal gain.
I disagree with AOC on many things, but we‚Äôd have a lot less problems with government of more politicians were as real as her.  No bs.  Upfront as much as possible, and trying to hold oneself to some higher ideal.  The current cable networks hate her though, probably because of this.  She throws a wrench in CNN and Fox News narratives and they don‚Äôt like that.
MTG would like to have a word with you
Half the country hates her though
If they're a politician someone will find a way.

‚Ä¶then you don‚Äôt understand politics or how this in itself is a political move.

What if she said she didn't want kids because it would influence her? Would she not buy an electric car, or and oil car? By making a choice to not own something, it does still influence your choice.
Who is mad?
I would t say I‚Äôm ‚Äúmad‚Äù about it, but it‚Äôs a thin statement when her significant other is deep into crypto
She's a congresswoman, not a Senator. But it won't be long until she's there. She has a great future ahead. I don't agree with her on everything BUT I believe she's acting in good faith, even when she's wrong. That's suuuuper rare nowadays and I hope she stays strong and doesn't let DC corrupt her
That how politicians should be mandated to act. They lost the right to good faith long ago.
The fact that people so rabidly attack Pelosi for this is one of the strongest evidences of how effective the right wing media machine is. 

We saw multiple republican senators sell everything right before covid (after a closed door briefing on covid) and yet we rarely hear their names on this sub. 

And we have seen extremely obvious Republican corruption all during the Trump admin as well. And yet the first and most attacked person for corruption is always Pelosi.

 It'd be funny if it wasn't so sad. ""Free thinkers"" always all thinking the same thing together. Very interesting.
Serious question, if you aren‚Äôt from the United States why are you so invested in our politics? I generally want to know, because I usually see conservatives from other countries talking shit about democrats or liberals but I don‚Äôt really see any liberals from other countries involve themselves in our politics. Does someone pay you, or are you just a loser of your own free will?

But it's her husband /s
You're way too fired up about this,

Also i think you misunderstood what I meant. 

I meant there's a couple of possible scenarios 

1. She holds crypto and shills it üëé

2. She hates crypto with a passion and actively campaigns against it. üëé

3. She doesn't hold any, but is unbiased in her opinion of it, probably wanting reasonable regulations, understanding of its new role in the worlds economy, with as you pointed out maybe some realistic and fair criticisms. üëç
Have you read the other comments? People just take any opportunity when aoc is mention to says she dumb and stuff
Based on what? 
Just because you have a narrative in your mind does not mean no evidence of anything means your right.

So far she has shown to be saying her honest opinions, even if you don‚Äôt agree with them, shes been straight forward.

This is why when there are hit pieces or tweets against her, its always about her going back to bartending, or being ugly, or being stupid.

It is never about what she has been saying because she backs up what she says.

Just look at how the green new deal has been treated. The opposers tend to respond with ‚Äúshe cares about cow farts.
Theres a difference between direct and indirect benefits. 

Extreme example. Interracial marriage. Should interracial couples excuse themselves from opinions on it? Should only single people be considered unbiased.

Now government contracts. Should someone who owns a steel factory vote on what steel factory the government contracts
Check the replies to upvoted positive comments about this/her
yeah. As long as you're aware and have a somehow clear understanding of BTC and Crypto in general, is hard to not have your feet wet even if it's just a small bag to see what happens.
Hi. I think most coins are tulips at best and scams at worst. I also have a small amount of several coins because it's a low-risk/high-reward gamble right now. In the long term, this is not a good thing for financial markets, the environment, or even accountability. I don't think we can simply policy our way out of this, but it needs to be a focal point for the future.
Here! I think it's all a scam but I'm holding three coins because it's probably going to bring more returns than bonds if nothing else.

I'd say I have a pretty sizable % of my investments in it, too.
Imagine you're telling your friend at a bar ""I don't go down on my GF's sister because I respect my GF""... That kinda tell's you that you find your GF's sister hot and you would bang her if you didn't respect your GF. 

Obviously doesn't mean it's true, but this kind of sentence is used in that manner most of the time.

I‚Äôm glad AOC is coming down on the right side of this particular issue at least.
[deleted]
Yup, she‚Äôs smart, competent and from what I‚Äôve seen seems like a genuinely nice person. I think she would be a wonderful president someday to be honest, although the last two have set the bar pretty low imo
Those eyes though. Tells a vastly different tale.
She‚Äôs not very good at governing unfortunately, ranked one of the least effective members of Congress :(

You're joking right?   God I hope you're a teenager or else we're all fucked
Sorry to burst your bubble but she is an incompetent, lying far-leftist. I hope you don't get ppl like her in office. that would be a disaster since you don't need communism for example
Looks are deceiving.
Like when she tweeted out we need more bail reform cause it is too high the week after the Waukesha parade massacre. I cannot understand why anyone would disagree with her
Her silly views are great for helping criminals.
How much where you paid to say that?
Are you fucking kidding me? Are redditors this fucking stupid?
Can I just say in a world where everything (especially politics) is so fucking binary, I really appreciate the nuance in your post. That you can disagree with her policies but still have such respect for her is great and from my experience very rare.
I‚Äôd vote for her so easily, one of the only politicians I actually like and think is trying to help. Plus the hate she gets makes me like her more
Have you read the Green New Deal she proposed though? The paper showed how idealistic and naive she is, when she thinks we can replace every single combustion engine vehicle, shut down coal and gas power plants within a few years without causing huge disruption to the sensitive energy grid, and achieve net zero carbon by 2030.
She believes in MMT. She doesn't have any credibility whatsoever.

In any case she's hardcore authoritarian and can go fuck herself for that.
> There was some documentary I saw on Netflix that actually followed her a bit when she was running for her first election and it was really cool. 

That doc's name is Knock Down the House and it is super worth watching!
Well, she also says that mass looting is not occurring across the country.  Has a backbone, yes, but also pushes clear propaganda.
Also, being a young, outspoken woman of ethnicity makes her easy to demonize among many core conservative demographics.
Speaking as someone who is not involved with ‚Äúspecial interests‚Äù I generally agree with AOC‚Äôs ideals. Issue is that they‚Äôre only ever ideals and she‚Äôs really just a mouthpiece. Almost a piece of controlled opposition for the neoliberals running the Democratic Party. I see her say a lot of good things, but am not really aware of her being a driver of the legislation she calls out for. 

For example, I see a headline like once a week with AOC saying something like ‚Äúanother day Biden could‚Äôve cancelled student loans‚Äù when he at this point has made it clear that he won‚Äôt and that it should be a congressional action. So does she then start drafting a bill to push through the house? No. She just sends another tweet about Biden not issuing an executive order - while probably also being against ‚Äúlegislation by executive order‚Äù.
She was put into office by special interests. A pawn for the radical left.
She was literally hired during a casting call by Justice Democrats funded by Cenk Uyger

God I love how dumb redditors are
AOC ran on all the stuff that is popular with the majority of Americans but when push came to shove she praised Biden and caved to Pelosi.  Sure she gets her fair share from the right but if you are truly left and paying attention you know she has earned the hate from the left.
>	wants to be effective 

She‚Äôs among the least effective members of Congress. 

https://thelawmakers.org/find-representatives#/

230th out of 240 Democratic members of the House. She has yet to even get a single bill out of the committee stage. 

If she wants to be effective at her job, she‚Äôs failing miserably.
For the moment, it does seem like she is 100% more hoenst than the majority of congress. But then.. the bar is so low.
yeah that whole farce of what 8 of them (on both sides) who had ""blind trusts"" but all magically made million dollar moves the DAY that they had a security meeting about Covid? 

Its sad when everyone knows its bullshit, but nothing gets done about it.
I totally agree, it's almost impossible to believe that a politician actually has their constituents' best interests at heart. I hope she truly does.
>I live in a world where a politicians word seldom matches their actions.

I'm not looking for engagement because you would lie, but if you are honest with yourself you are just taking this at face value from a bunch of scare tactics on social media and headlines and probably haven't looked into this whatsoever. You've probably done more research on some random scamcoin than you have about politics. Most people want to pick their belief and have that validated.

The problem is that everyone actually fighting for the change we're discussing here is a radical socialist. Republican politicians said so. You probably aren't looking too closely into which ones are matching their words.
She's the real deal.  That is why so many people absolutely **hate** her.

Welcome to ~~cryptocurrency~~ Reddit*
I'm mostly referring to the numerous comments that she probably holds traditional stocks or variations of such, which she specifically talks about in the article.
You clearly don‚Äôt understand what communism is if she is one pal don‚Äôt come after me assuming what I define republicans as when you clearly fail to grasp the simple definition of communism.
You‚Äôre a lot of fun at parties, huh?
**says good thing**

This commenter: Did someone verify this? Based on no evidence I think she's lying. So this is actually a bad thing she said.
Cortez doesn't really have a track record for lying, and this statement is on brand, unlike practically all other politicians. But sure, if news break that she's hold any crypto, then sure, she should be scrutinized
Says the active poster of r/Conservative lol
I guess it'd be like ForEx trading? Just seems odd to me. Thanks.
Well you can believe that if you want and right now it‚Äôs both and in all practically is heavily towards the investment side.  It‚Äôs a currency uses are currently limited compared to cash.
Get rid of lobbying and limit pay for speeches and other work like it
For real, there is no right way to go about politicians salaries, you just have to hope that your country raised persons with strong values that won't lose them when they get rich.
Yeah very few politicians have little money to begin with and the ones that get into politics that are relatively poor aren‚Äôt in it for the money

Edit poorly worded I‚Äôm saying most politicians are already fairly well off financially before they even enter politics but politics is seen as a way to accumulate wealth not to serve
That‚Äôs because the people it directly benefits are the ones who are in charge of changing it which won‚Äôt happen
They are nearly all self serving their is no amount of money that would get them to stop
I think this is just false, the people that would sacrifice their life in this fashion are (almost always) immediately weeded out because they won't play ball with lobbyists.
Is average salary 'zero pay' now? That's some interesting math. As for taking the brunt of everyone's discontent - in democratic countries, politicians should be there because the majority wants them there.
She‚Äôs more avoiding a conflict of interest than being unbiased
There‚Äôs a difference between being unbiased / human and the corruption that exists in most governments
This solution I agree with there so much stagnation within most governments that little progress is made in any direction
Term limits might sound good on a surface level, but they bring with them more problems than they solve. I highly recommend doing some research into the (many) drawbacks of term limits before advocating for them. They're a terrible idea.
Politicians should retire at 65 or even earlier the problem most of us have is the fact that they don‚Äôt retire until they are almost dead so we have all these old people in power with no desire to learn or educate themselves about progress as it has little to no impact on them but yet they still get to decide policy and regulation about such things
>	So should all politicians just never retire?

I mean, do any politicians actually retire anyway? Loads of them are well past retirement age and still governing like out of touch dinosaurs.
Forcing them to put investment assets in a third party fund of which they have no control or visibility of which companie's shares it holds.
Hasn‚Äôt Singapore suffered from multiple military coups due to political instability from corruption?
Completely agree with the need for transparency with finances
Why are you pretty certain?
Giving AOC any type of credit will make a lot of people in here combust lol
Thank you. No sitting politician can completely eliminate bias, but there are LOTS and I mean FUCK LOADS who are extreme immoral/unethical hypocrites (look at basically any republican, or someone like Joe Manchin)
[deleted]
Nope. AOC backs up her words with actions. Whether you agree with her politics or not, you can't deny that she's usually honest about what she stands for, and doesn't really say one thing but do another like most politics.
Exactly, these days for so many it's got nothing to do with the message and everything to do with who said it.

LOL, bullshit.
>where 80+% of users are Democrat lapdogs,

Completely untrue,  80%+ might be centre, or centre left politically,  but there are plenty on the left that don't like the Democrats (or the huge number that aren't Americans). Generally people with allegiance to a political party are morons.
It's not about Democrat or Republican. You've missed the point.
> Democrat lapdogs

That doesn't exist as much as you think it does. Most liberals vote democrat because they have no other choice, and not because they actually *support* the Democratic party, which is only marginally better than the Republican party.

AOC has never released her tax returns.  None of congress does.  She fills outs the financial disclosure form like the rest of congress that is regularly lied on.  I am not saying she is at all.  She has been around long enough yet to build up the capital to make it big.  In a few terms though she will be a multimillionaire like the rest.
the IRS has literally always had the tax returns of your orange boogeyman. they couldn't find dirt on him even when Obama was weaponizing them against his political opposition.

boohoohoo
>and you‚Äôre required to be telling the IRS about your crypto.

You are not required to tell the IRS that you're holding crypto.

EDIT: Why the downvotes? You tell the IRS when you **sell** crypto. **Holding** crypto doesn't show up on your tax return.
I'm not talking about some other politician, the point is you can own coins without anyone ever getting to know that if you dont want them to know.
Lol why are you bringing up trump?

Also why do you think politicians like AOC can‚Äôt lie? What are you a fan boy/girl or something?

All politicians are liars and will do anything to get re-elected, not just red or blue.

Your favorite politician is a lying hypocrite too, sorry to tell you.
I see you know as much about taxes, finance, and economics as AOC. 

As an aside, the fact that this comment has 40 upvotes reflects the sheer stupidity of the bewildered herd of future bagholders on this sub. 

First, Federal INCOME taxes, the basis for tax returns, require you to disclose sources of INCOME. 

""For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.""

You don't need ""to be telling the IRS"" about the purchase of cryptocurrency. One could purchase and HODL BTC for 30 years and tell the IRS nothing. 

I guess bandwagon jumpers don't realize decentralized currency is a libertarian concept. 

If you want to get your pom poms out for a vapid and hypocritical democratic socialist you should beeline it over to r/politics.
Required my ass. You can just ""forget "" to add them to your returns, publish the paper work and then amend it later. Even if you dont amend it , all you get is a letter telling you to fix it. 

Btw im not a tax pro.

How is he wrong? Last two years world literally going to shit and politicians get richer.

Wait so if I think that politicians are corrupt, it makes me a ""Q boi""?

He‚Äôs not wrong man go to https://www.opensecrets.org this country is run on legalized bribery. Aoc and Bernie are probably the only decent ones
Ignorant.
Agreed. Not holding something is not the same as not understanding something. Personally I like the idea of neutrality, what if they held ETH and publicly shit on BTC or had policies in place that were less favorable to something like SOL. Idk I want the people making these decisions to be as neutral as possible. Kudos to AOC for doing so
If they hold index funds then wouldn‚Äôt they just be incentivized for low corporate tax and no minimum wage?
1 - some of the public hold crypto and that likely will increase. They shouldn‚Äôt have to hold crypto, but to represent some of the population they should be able to if they want. They already hold plenty of bank and other stock. 

2 - yes agree with this. 

3 - I agree you don‚Äôt have to hold to understand, but it does help. If they hold bank, pharma, healthcare, automotive, tech, energy, real estate and other sectors, why shouldn‚Äôt they be allowed to hold crypto?  I don‚Äôt foresee congress banning themselves withholding themselves from other things they legislate.
I do not think that about GMs.

But I am also concerned with government figures ruling on an asset class they know very little about. 

I don‚Äôt know what the answer is but I don‚Äôt have much of a problem with them owning it, as I think having skin in the game is the greatest accelerant to understanding. As long as they aren‚Äôt making preemptive moves based on insider information of legislation, or having their holdings otherwise influence their use of power.

""All politicians are shitty, they only want to get rich and fuck the people""

""What? She's not even trying to get rich?! What a shitty politician!""

There's just no winning with you people.
believe it or not, being a congressperson isn't best measured by how much capital you can accumulate.
Correction: when her personal finances show she‚Äôs not conducting legal insider trading by using private info she learns as a Congressman
""she is not corrupt, how is she supposed to navigate the corrupt financial system?!"" lol
> How am I supposed to think she knows anything about regulating global financial markets when her personal finances show she doesn't know what she's doing?



Graduating with honors in Economics from an elite university probably gave her more knowledge about the global economy than saving money.
If you have any money more than being impoverished, she wants to take it away from you. Bottom line. She will absolutely succeed at that if we let her continue to spout her anti democratic, communistic sloppy mouth diarrhea.
There‚Äôs another comment that said that up top. I was mocking that comment but didn‚Äôt have time to capitalize every other alphabet lol. That‚Äôs my bad.
Riley Roberts would probably be very surprised to hear this.

We've won the last two popular votes. In fact in the last two elections the only thing we've lost was the 2016 electoral college
Correct many people still don't understand this simple statment that its not a currency its just a investment you do for longer period of time.

Typical to start name calling. Mature move! She has introduced 21 bills which have not even made it to a committee. A recent study by the Center for Effective Lawmaking reveals her to be one of the least effective members of Congress. Big difference between ‚Äúsponsoring‚Äù someone else‚Äôs work and you own actual work making it anywhere close to a vote. It‚Äôs probably easier for you to just call people mouth breathers though, it reveals your ineptitude for critical discussion or facts for that matter.
Like I‚Äôm being sarcastic 
But also kind of serious 
If anyone would like to please tell me why this makes sense‚Ä¶.
Even IF she was the most honest person on earth, if she saw bitcoin and realised it was an amazing opportunity she would have bought it rather than think ""I don't want to buy this it might make me unbiased"" because she is already so honest and whiter than white that it wouldn't make her unbiased surely?

Also the whole premise that she ""doesn't want to be biased"" stinks of BS to me. This is the woman who cries crocodile tears for the camera on numerous occasions. She's a fraud.
Yea we know you aren't successful
I quit listening to the shit she says after she joined forces with Omar and Tlaib.
So she's NOT a socialist?
This is the truth anyone who believes politicians is stupid
It‚Äôs digital. It‚Äôs not attached to any government. Other than those major differences, it works the same. Now if you mean adoption is entirely different, I agree. But that‚Äôs only solved by more AOCs buying their lattes with crypto.
I am equally appreciative of the answer and horrified for its content
*fake tears before mexican border for the media*
I have to accept people like you are lost. You are far too deep in hating someone because FOX News told you to hate her. Have fun being brainwashed by media telling you how to think.
Is she not allowed to own dollar bills either? Or pounds? Or pesos? Or euros?

It‚Äôs a College indoctrinated Left-Wing echo chamber
There is nothing ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù about Communism, regardless the theory of your Keynesian Economics Professor from your expensive indoctrination center told you. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling the struggles of your decision to take on a massive debt load at such a young age. One day, you‚Äôll grow up, get responsibilities, pay taxes and become Conservative. Until then, realize that even though China has 5 times the population of The United States, our middle class has a comparable amount of people as theirs. That means, they practically don't have a middle class. How could that be better for you if you lived in that environment? We became the World's economic super power from Entrepreneurship, Innovation, Individual sacrifice, Free Market Capitalism and having a Representative Republic. Communism has failed every where and is responsible for more death than anything else in the history of the world.

As an American, she's one of the best actresses I've seen yet!
She's too tall for you
Bit coin. As in a coin you bite. As in she doesn't know what bit coin is. As in she's dumb.
She's dumber than a box of rocks and thankfully, has no ideas other than to support socialism, the number one driver of why we need crypto as unabated printing of memory drives the dollar to zero.
She represent the direction of the party I completely disagree with and she does it in very aggressive and exaggerated way.   


Not everyone who makes over 100K or even 500K is the enemy, corporates are not the enemy, tech companies are not the enemy, people getting wealthy are not the enemy and finally, white men are definitely not the enemy. But that's all her narrative and the hate she has in her eyes when she is facing any of those I found repulsive
Fuck that. She holds fiat and several other investments. She‚Äôs biased. She‚Äôs vocally biased. This is nothing but a play for votes.
Just like AOC did? 

Seriously How did you not see that?
That we're not battling on equal grounds
The whole conflict of interest. I'm not going to write a novel response about governments and money laws.
And holding a house makes you biased for housing market. Cute idea but realistically you would need to own NOTHING to be unbiased
Sure, but fiat is a long-established financial tool with a wealth of existing regulations. We are not expecting any massive changes to be debated on fiat.

Cryptocurrencies will see a vast amount of game-changing debate over the next decade.

Having said that, I think it would be great if politicians had to be 100% transparent with all of their finances.
This comment is all the proof I need that most of you in this sub are fart sniffers ignorant of reality
covidian tinfoil spotted
Communism is a type of authoritarianism
She's not on my side. She's a anti-capitalist communist.
Yeah, you're right.  Its like shes turned a leaf and is no longer baised in her views because crypto showed her the error of her ways...

Wake up kid. She is toxic as fuck. They all are.
Oh‚ÄîI don‚Äôt click on links. Bad headline IMO. I would suggest what she really had in her mind is how to manipulate this towards supporting a political agenda. Congress isn‚Äôt smart enough‚Ä¶.so they won‚Äôt be able to make a clear policy. It‚Äôs about power.
Man i don't think she studies as much as i do, I know many on this sub live crypto so i think probably a good percentage now 1000x what AOC does.
Ok, it's not exactly that she ""can't be unbiased.""  It's that she feels she would have to act on those biases.  As a politician, she should only be taking actions that support the base she represents, not herself.  She's just a bad person that doesn't give a damn about the people she represents.
Huh?  Read that again.  I don't understand your question.
Members of congress? Probably none of them.
Did not know that. Thats pretty awesome
AOC
Ah yes, a future millionaire with zero investments, k.
Check out the I‚Äôm sure clause. I do not think it means what you think it means.
Stones maybe. Also not allow Congress to vote on congress's salaries.
Don't get me wrong. I'm all for people paying a fair share. But the extremely wealthy are always going to find ways around whatever tax burden is placed on them. And when the plans to tax the rich fail-- who's next? Those who are doing 'this much better' than those who have decided not to move forward in life because they are greedy and no one deserves to have that much.
Name one thing.
Name one thing.
bf? just because she's not investing directly doesn't mean much lol. she's far from unbiased
Yeah I agree with you. Can buy whatever you want but why can‚Äôt she buy Bitcoin if she wants. If she wants Bitcoin then she should just buy some. What‚Äôs the difference if she owns one Tesla or one Bitcoin. I don‚Äôt see the problem
my point went over your head
Indeed, diversified and balanced across many types of assets.
ITS A CURRENCY
Honestly, they do have very little impact. I mean china is the most populated nation and they banned crypto and bitc/eth are still doing really great.

HODL culture. You don't HODL fiat you save invest and spend
The market has changed, crypto originally only had one use case which is a store of value. Then smart contracts happened and now it's more like an app store. Most people use stablecoins pegged to the dollar like DAI, nano, or USDC if they want to use it as currency
This is the thing that scares me most... If we don't treat it like currency, is it not effectively worthless?  It serves no point.
While you make a good point, it's not really relevant to this topic as politicians also should not hold foreign currencies (for similar reasons to why they shouldn't hold investments)
Plenty of people still discuss crypto as a currency and normalized medium of exchange, just not in your circles evidently. Twitter has tons of them
Bitcoin has diverged from what Satoshi originally wanted. It‚Äôs not gonna he used as a currency with its current tech
To be fair, the SEC ruled that Bitcoin is digital property. It shouldn't surprise anyone that in a land of regulation we mostly follow the rules and see things through the lens of regulation. I don't get taxed on Bitcoin like currency so... The government gets what it wants. It's a powerful beast.
You can blame the apes for that. Once people showed up looking to get ""shares"" of crypto, I knew we were in new territory
Buying and selling crypto is taxable because the IRS identifies crypto as *property*, not currency. As a result, tax rules that apply to property (but not real estate tax rules) transactions, like selling collectible coins or vintage cars that can appreciate in value, also apply to¬†bitcoin,¬†ethereum, and¬†other shitcoins
Tells you a lot about reasonable people's view of the reality of this product. When it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a speculative investment and not a medium for every day trade.
You ever think that the conversation was steered that way on purpose?
I mean the first generation of people were those insisting it could be useful as a currency, while being brutally mocked by those from the outside, which continue to today for valid reasons. Back then it was a joke of ""this is so fucking stupid and it can only work if you get millions of stupid people to also start in on it and then actual rich people can take control like they do elsewhere."" 

If you bet for humanity and got out of that nonsense, you didn't make a bunch of money about it. If you bet against humanity and threw some bucks or rigs at it early, then you made a little money, lost it in an exchange fiasco, then doubled down after and eventually made big money once enough people got suckered in, and now it's some bizarre nightmare disaster of fools getting rich from other fools while the already filthy rich have another way to manipulate and control the world.

Now you got enough common people with something to gain at everyone else's expense for creating no value, which mostly amounts to proselytizing this horseshit and promoting anyway possible because why not downvote a negative comment like this? If you're holding you only stand to benefit by silencing these negative perspectives, and promoting only that which might encourage others to buy in.

I don't think the design of Bitcoin is conducive to being used as a currency.  It's not designed to be stable, it is designed to appreciate in value over time, and the amount of transactions is can support is really quite small in the scheme of things.  It's a great investment and really shitty as a currency.
well, it was established years ago that the Bitcoin network is very slow compared to traditional payment channels. The Lightning Network has brought improvements but thats a recent development.
Bitcoin IS more like stocks than currency; because it's a bad currency. It's slow, the fees to move it around are high, and it deflates, so it incentivizes people to hold instead of spending it.

We talk about and use crypto as currency all the time. We use XLM to turn fiat into other tokens, we pay for things with crypto, we have stablecoins to act as reliable currency units. It's just not cutting-edge development. All it is is moving value around, for the most part, it's a solved problem.
Yeah. I mean, I love the idea of it for currency, I just can't understand the price, and it seems like there are better coins from a tech standpoint.

I really thought that the Dogecoin-nascar [thing](https://www.thedrive.com/news/39188/dogecoin-in-nascar-when-a-speedy-shiba-inu-stormed-talladega) was going to point out the absurdity, but it's like the opposite happened.
it's pretty simple, though, yeah?  


you spend currency, you buy stocks.  


so what do you do with bitcoin?
They‚Äôre not crypto enthusiasts. They‚Äôre enthusiasts in investing.
Number go up. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs btc, shiba inu, or Gamestop
It doesn't help that the ideoligy behind bitcoin dissappeared, also when a supposed currency is backed by a real usable currency it doesn't make it a currency.
The problem is still the time per transaction and the energy cost of each transaction. It takes f*cking forever for a transaction to go through which makes it damn near useless as a currency. So instead people trade it like stock. Because it's more useful that way.
It‚Äôs a speculative asset. Not currency until your country makes it legal tender!
I‚Äôd say 90% of ‚Äúcrypto enthusiasts‚Äù are in it for the money, not for the future.  They may hope for the crypto future, but by virtue, that means they make money, so they do everything they can to materialize it.  Every single crypto enthusiast I‚Äôve met, myself included, is excited for the potential of it, but at the end of the day, they see it as a way to get rich.
Multiple family members and friends have asked me to help them with buying stocks (not a finacial advisor, was in training but just watch the market like any other ape). So I ask them about their goals and interests and give them a few recommendations and how to tell if a stock is one they would want or not. Then after all that they look at me straight faced and say what about bitcoin and Dogecoin Im interested in those kinda stocks. I love crypto but good lord does that drive me crazy!
>Tells you a lot about the current generation of crypto enthusiasts

Not really. It's actually more about the lack of utility for decentralized currency with very high overhead. There have been a few threads on this recently in the programming subs and the general consensus is that Bitcoin just isn't suitable as an everyday currency. If it is decentralized there is too much overhead in making transactions. If it becomes centralized then it is essentially just a currency backed by absolutely nothing and completely at the mercy of wherever it is centralized. Most of the utility of it currently seems to be as an investment vehicle where its volatility and lack of oversight is seen as its primary feature.

The functional underpinnings of Bitcoin just don't mesh well with an everyday currency from a technical standpoint. Of course software engineers have been saying blockchain isn't an appropriate solution for most problems it is applied to, and in many cases the negatives substantially outweigh the positives.
Well using it as a currency in direct peer to peer is kind of impossible now at 7 transactions per second.

You have to do everything through an exchange at which point you're back to using a bank so what's the point?
Eth is the currency of the internet. As much as I hate it because of the horribly high gas, ETH has users AND use. Bitcoin has a small use case and it is also not the easiest to transact with. 

Bitcoin is digital gold. Practically no one transacts with gold these days. We use cash or cash equivalents. That's what ETH does for us today.
I treat it like a stock because it's taxed like one.
I am on your side. 

But they are both. It very much IS a stock. Only 5% of the worlds population uses crypto. 

One day!
I dont personally see it as a currency. Imo it will never be used as one on a grand scale. I mean why would it when cheaper and faster methods exist from other cryptocurrencies designed for that express purpose?

I see bitcoin as digital gold, a hedge against inflation. In my opinion, you don't need to believe it will become the global currency to believe in it. And even people who would refer to it as a currency... isn't their goal still being rich? Let's not pretend anyone is doing this purely out of the kindness in their hearts. You can respect and believe in tech while also treating it as an investment. 

Idk, just my two satoshis
Yep. That it‚Äôs all a complete  scam. Some of it wasn‚Äôt. But the scams have infected the entire market and premise. It‚Äôs over.
Well I mean Bitcoin isn‚Äôt designed to be used as peer to peer money anymore so it‚Äôs not very surprising that no one sees it as that anymore either.
They don‚Äôt in this sub, but there are plenty of Defi protocols centered around crypto adoption as a means to spend funds, Terra Luna being my favorite example
Bitcoin is supposed to be used as an exchange between currencies not an investments. When people start seeing the value of Bitcoin skyrocket people starts investing on it and I stopped buying Bitcoin to exchange from USD to Philippine Pesos to give to my grandmother who need money for retirement.

I also got pissed when my cousins were using the money to build a mining rig against my grandmother's health. So I ended up sending my grandma to a nursing home instead. Fuck the crypto mining my video game business isn't making me money  and I have work part time to accommodate my living cost.
That's because it's not adapted much as a currency. Most people use it as an investment.
Crypto is fake and will tank at some point. It‚Äôs such a scam
That's what happens when you have 200% year over year growth. It has nothing to do with generations or media or stories. This growth is cooling off over time, and perhaps in 10-15 years the price is going to be stable enough that the world will talk about Bitcoin as a currency again. But it's a process.
Because it turns out deregulation just meant corporations are the institutions that engage in centralization instead of the state. So now Bitcoin is just an asset class.

Cryptocurrency will never in any way shape or form replace fiat currency now.
Funny it‚Äôs called a crypto enthusiast. Like you said, it was created as a means of currency and transferring value. Currently it‚Äôs a giant money and greed grab, not so much crypto enthusiasts. If it crashes 80% again, I can imagine people will disappear for another 3 years until the next halving again
Not entirely true; there are still some projects, such as Nano, that are regularly talked about as a digital currency. The big boys, like Bitcoin and ETH, are long past that talk though as they‚Äôre simply unfit for this purpose with such high fees and slow speeds.
You know why this is? 

Because Bitcoin has failed at being a currency‚Ä¶ and honestly so has ETH and basically every large crypto why would I use crypto when I can simply Venmo someone money. I even likely pay less money than it costs to use any of the big cryptos to withdraw it instantly to my bank with Venmo‚Äôs 1.5% fee. Or if you‚Äôre simply patient, you can wait for a day or two.
Your absolutely right!! They wanted to turn DeFi into a casino and push it away from its true foundation of being a Crypto Currency to be Exchanged. The further they get everyone‚Äôs thought process to change, the easier the FED & US Government can make it more like a casino then a currency üí∑ üí¥ üí∏
It's amazing anyone talks about bitcoin as a pure currency with no significant speculation. It's obviously chaotically volatile compared to any government fiat today.
PLENTY of people talk about using crypto as a currency, you're just not looking in the right places. See: UST and DoKwon, Daniele Esta projects (Time, Spell, Mim), project OHM, project FIAT dao. Reddit is not a place for timely crypto news. You wanna stay in the know, crypto twitter will keep you abreast of defi 2.0/3.0 way better than reddit will.
I have been trying to get people to pay me in crypto. Nobody wants to spend it.
I would not say nobody. The sub /r/nanocurrency is one of the biggest in crypto
That's because currency is a shell of what it was supposed to be. Money used to be a store of value, these days it is just something that deflates every year.
Is that honestly surprising? Crypto in its current form is simply not a good currency.
The most popular coins are not good money for trade for ages. They both need to fix the issue. This os why people are using it a the new gold asset that is easier to store.
Bitcoin has fundamentally failed as a currency for this reason. 

I got into an argument about how any cryptocurrency can be a currency when the price is able to (and more often then not does) fluctuate wildly between two different values month to month. 

This particular person was into BCH-ABC (which in fairness has better aspects to become a currency then btc does - faster to transfer and lower fees) and stated that BCH-ABC would become a currency and have less volatility with a higher market cap and general usage/adoption.

Bullshit. BTC hit a trillion $ in market cap and still lost half of its value in a couple of months. Don't try to tell me it can become a true currency if it just gets a little bit bigger. 

It will never be a currency so long as you can bet on its future dollar value, so long as you can buy and sell it on HIGH leverage multiples through various exchanges, and so long as it has as long to transfer speeds as it does.

It still serves a purpose, but it has lost its appeal as a currency imho. It's more similar to dogecoin then it is to a real, legitimate currency
My USDC is a currency... everything else is stocks on crack
The properties of cryptocurrency right now is closer to a stock than a currency. It fluctuates way to wildly. Most people treat it similar to a traditional investment.
Because it isn't a currency. I started buying bitcoin in like 2011 or 2012 and I dont think its a currency. I used it as one back then and that was pretty stupid. There goes about 5 million dollars. It's an asset and has almost zero characteristics of a currency.
Yes money is a commodity, BTC is just like forex
Cool, I'll check it out. Thanks.
I'll show you a new class of Asset.
Bitcoin is a bad currency because it deflates.  Because you likely will incur an opportunity cost whenever you try to use it as a currency.  Why would you ever invest your currency, Bitcoin, if holding Bitcoin will likely get higher returns?  Why would you buy food today with BTC if you can buy more food the next day with the same amount of BTC?

The cryptocurrency market generally incentivises holding, which is a terrible model if you want cryptocurrency to be used as a currency.
I agree with you about the inflation/deflation thing. I personally like the fundamental reasons for bitcoin...

...But it's still not a real currency. You can definitely spend it, but businesses can't rely on it, and the third parties that do just instantly convert to USD. It's in a weird space right now... all i'm saying about it.
lol, love the love. No hard feelings
> Not backed by anything? It's backed by the most secure computer network in the world.

That's not what people mean when they say ""backed"".  It means that buying crypto doesn't give you ownership right over any actual physical good or IP; you just own a Bitcoin, which has an arbitrary value.

Unlike a stock (an actual piece of a corporation that owns actual assets and makes income) or a bond (a legal guarantee that a corporation or government has to repay you).

> You can't put a price on that, which is why it will eventually hold the value of the world on the network. 

Lol, there's nothing unique about Bitcoin, it can be easily duplicated.  It's designed to be deflationary, which means it will *never* be adopted as a currency (why would you spend it if the value will always go up?).

I think there's a lot of value in the Blockchain, but Bitcoin isn't special.
It is semantics I don't disagree. I thought it'd be an interesting question to pose and I got a lot of interesting answers.
No need to start that conversation. Honestly not here to argue.

My point was just that it's being talked about like it's a speculative asset and not a currency. Which, in my opinion, doesn't make sense.
It is more than just faith for the USD. It is the power of the state in enforcing legal tender. Try and pay your taxes in Bitcoin and see how far it gets you.
People don‚Äôt spend bitcoin all of the time.  Nobody wants to be like that guy that bought a pizza for 10,000 BTC.
Very true. And also really weird. I don't think they know what to do with it. But if it's an asset they can tax it, so that's where they landed.
SO glad that there aren't other countries besides the US and its regulatory body deciding what money is for the whole world
It is in El Salvador so your statement is already false
Lightning network transactions are instant bro
Bitcoin with lightning network is fast and cheap enough for everyday tx. Anything of significant value should be done on chain
Nano has nothing special over other alts or even bitcoin on the lightning network. That's why it isn't even in the top 100
your mom and i aren't mutually exclusive
In terms volatility, this is the best I could find.  [https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/)

You want that chart to basically go to 0-1% to join the 'currency club'. You don't want to be near that 0-1% if you want to call it an investment. That's the technical thought behind my question, hope it addresses your comment.
Is that a good thing?
Just curious, why do you think two would exist if one is a better currency? What value is there in spending resources on BTC if ETH turns out to be better? Or the other way around?
>Tether 

In a good way or a bad way?
If you want to get super pissed there was someone who took huge short positions on airlines right before the Sept. 11th attacks.

>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has seen her wealth increase to nearly $115 million from $41 million in 2004

That...is a below market return though. For an insider trader, she apparently isn't any good at it. 

Annual return for an investment which grew from $41M to $115M over 15 years is 7.12%.

The S&P500 averaged a return of 9.01% per year over the same period. 

>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) saw his net worth increase from $3 million to over $34 million during that time

Now Mitch...the turtle was anything behind the market with a whopping **17.6%** annual return.
Because the purpose was to discuss a target percentage of manufactured autos that would be electric. Since Tesla was already 100% electric, they weren't relevant to the discussion.

Note that Biden didn't invite any *other* electric vehicle makers, either.
I think it‚Äôs kind of odd that people are calling for crypto to be treated differently than other things when it comes to lawmakers owning it.

Especially Bitcoin. It‚Äôs decentralized, so owning some doesn‚Äôt mean you have a measure of control or influence over it. 

About the only thing a lawmaker can influence is how much it gets taxed, but they already have that same influence over land, cars, gold, anyway.
[deleted]
How myopic
What worries me when it comes to politicians, is that although they may not *necessarily* own any coin, they'd find a loophole to instead just own a crypto farm itself.
You mean politicians shouldn't be motivated by greed and power? Sounds interesting
Yeah its weird. Judges for instance cant oversee a hearing where they have personal financial interests on the line. It happens all the time though and virtually nothing is done about it.
We should call it Dick's law because all it is, is not being a dick.
How would that be worded? Would politicians be unable to hold pensions? Would they have to sell off all existing investments when taking up the job? If all politicians have no investments, then surely then they would not represent the majority of Americans that do?

A certain requirement for diversification of their investments might be good, or at least those investments being legally required to be publicly available so people can determine a politician's biases for themselves.
So we all agree, AOC 2032
Nothing saying its illegal to hold this position, so far as I know.
Aren't they required to disclose their investments?
Lol I guess that's true
Well plus there's a bad history of politicians making decisions based on their own financial benefit.
Who the hell holds regular currency as an investment they hope to make a gain on?
Right but she could push through legislation that would be pro-crypto, which would obviously be pro-bitcoin.
Crypto is even easier to influence then stocks... It has nothing to do with centralization....
That doesn't sound like the type of thing she does from my experience.
It's more than that though, since you can invest and profit on it in the same way you can for stocks, which can certainly impact the decisions you make as a lawmaker. The equivalent would probably be forex.
Hey, you want to buy some Botcoin?
Jarvis, we're running low on comment karma. comment ""Bullish on (random thing)""

Fuck Politicians!! The real culprits behind everything
> or just do so they can use it as a platform and pander for votes,

This.  I bet holding $100k in bitcoin is better for attracting (some) voters than spending $1m on advertising.
The smart ones definitely hold.
I mean Pelosi also sucks for her conflicts of interest.
No they shouldn‚Äôt. That would give them incentive to allow industry monopolies. Politicians investing in any companies has the potential to result in similar situations that we see in the internet/telecom industry.
To be fair? Just stop.
Unfortainitly, dollars are currently required to function in society.
Fiat currency is legal tender; it's not a ""conflict of interest"" lol what?
No, because everyone does that-the denominator is common there.

Buy my book, it is all in there. :)
Holding Fiat is not a conflict of interest!!!
I try not to vote for rich people either.
No one who's very wealthy just holds cash, a small percentage of their net worth sure, but the vast majority of congress is very wealthy or at least on their way to becoming very wealthy, and the way you grow wealth is by not having it sit in a bank. You buy real estate or use some other investment vehicle. I do agree with you generally though, if the two options for a congressman are crypto or cash, they're going to be biased toward whatever it is they hold. 

I think congress shouldn't be able to hold the vast majority of speculative investments. Or if they do, then they should be barred from voting on issues related to their holdings. If they are barred from voting on certain things like that, I really don't see it as a problem.
This comment is one of the stupidest things I‚Äôve read.
It isn't. Politicians should hold neither.
Nope. They can get educated without having a personal stake in the matter at hand and let experts advise them.
Yes, if you want to make money on stocks/assets go into literally any other job.
They [shouldn‚Äôt know what positions they hold](https://www.annuity.org/retirement/estate-planning/blind-trust/). This isn‚Äôt a new or radical idea
Yep.
When a person is in a position with decision making power or influence, or the ethical thing for them to do is separate themselves from *any* personal gain that could result from the decision making. This also applies to ""insider knowledge"".

Typical examples include removing people with hiring power from any hiring decisions when their relatives are applicants, or not allowing someone to make contract decisions with other organizations where they're members of the board.

In the case of investments, *ethically*, policymakers can hold investments, but they should have no decision making power over those investments. This is usually accomplished by placing the investments in a blind trust.
Correct
Blind trust, managed portfolio, etc. is fine.

They should not be actively picking stocks or coins when they are making policies that can influence which stocks or coins go up or down.
That's the whole point lol, that their knowledge and power can be used for their personal gain if they are holding speculative assets.
They are bootlickers because they lick the boot of politicians who carry conflicts of interest on the bootlickers' speculative assets of choice. Make sense now?   


Try not to lick any boots on your way out to the parking lot.
Wtf. They get paid 6 figures and give themselves raises all the time. They‚Äôre all set without the corruption.
Politicians should divest from all assets such as stock and crypto.
That and holding it would hopefully mean they would learn something about before passing legislation on it instead of the uniformed bills we have now.
Is it not reasonable that elected officials should be paid enough that there is no necessity to seek money elsewhere to afford to live and travel between DC and their home state? If congresspeople were paid 50k a year it'd make it even more likely that the only people who could run are those who are already rich or are willing to be bribed.
Why stop at assets? Politicians shouldn't drive a car if they are voting on legislation related to roads. The convenience of driving could influence their decision-making! And don't even get me started on phones
And this is only applying to anchors. Not the frequent pundits who give their opinions and state their moves daily. Lol, the anchors probably outperform them anyways simply staying in SPY and QQQ.

Usually this only applies if the employees at the company are privy to non public information. For example, execs who know what the quarterly earnings are. If that happens, you‚Äôll be subject to a lockout period and can only buy or sell after a certain date.

However your original point is still valid. Richard Burr should be in prison.
they're restricted from trading their own companies stock, nothing stops them from trading other securities in the market.
Agreed, long holding of stocks still would lead to Congress men making decisions to benefit their portfolio, even for industry based ETFs. It should be a blind trust where the Congress person just gives a risk tolerance to the manager at the beginning of their term.
I'll admit, I don't fully understand what you mean by just ""cap companies"". But at least small cap vs. S&P 500 (large cap) should provide the slightest de-motivation for creating giant monopolies. At least that was my thought. Give them access to slightly smaller things but definitely still index funds or sector related funds. Otherwise they'll just blindly pass laws to make Amazon literally own everything in 100 years.
>there is a world of difference between dating someone and being married to them


Indeed. Her boyfriend can escape the level of scrutiny that a spouse would with regards to insider-info.
The point i was making is that they should be improving median wages so that they improve their own standing.

The problem with corruption is everyone agrees it should be illegal, but the people in power choose not to make it so.

There is insane corruption already, and congresspeople make 3x the median wage. Your point is moot.
This is the best idea
I agree. It's really simple minded and wrong to think that they shouldn't be allowed to invest money. It should just need to be managed professionally and to a higher degree of scrutiny. Any messages between portfolio manager and client should legally need to be recorded and like you said only broad market index funds.
[removed]
This. Their incentive should be for the entire US economy to do well, not just their personal vested interests.
Same with healthcare too. I'm sick of watching $20k a year between myself and my employer go to my insurance company, and then it still costs a crap ton if/when something inevitably happens.  

Guess there's no way to frequently simulate how your local urgent care gets bought up by somebody out of network, though, just in time for when you're really sick and go there and don't notice it's not going to be covered well. Not that I had to pay $900 for freaking strep throat or anything.
Why not just let politicians invest directly in TSP funds, and only in TSP funds.
Yeah. Super-rich lawmakers are a problem, but you also don‚Äôt want to make lawmakers financially destitute because that will just a) make them more susceptible to financial influence because they *need* the money or b) make it so only the already-rich can afford to be lawmakers. 

They should be paid well and be able to invest, but it should be in broad funds where they don‚Äôt have any financial interest more specific than ‚Äúmake the economy good‚Äù
You mean the government employe tsp program? Hmm, if only we already had that available‚Ä¶
Still in theory creates a conflict of interest.

Equities increasing in price does not necessarily correlate with preserving and defending the Constitution and often is the exact opposite. For example right now Congress is incentivized to keep blowing up the biggest bubble in the history of the planet which I think is not in their constituents‚Äô best interests. 

Owning lots of stocks also puts Congresspeople in conflict with people who have shorted the market, or people who are heavy into bonds.
[There are many types of spez, but the most important one is the spez police. #Save3rdPartyApps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/)
I would accept this on the condition they don't know what the holdings are.
Corruption finds a way though. Are there any equal weighted full market index funds? Or in this example could they still sway things in their favor with corrupt legislation targeting the biggest allocations/companies in said funds.
Or how about they get an index of funds limited only to companies headquartered in their home state ‚Ä¶ would be intrigued to see how they impacts their votes
Then they just gotta push the fed to keep inflating like crazy so their 401k goes up.

Basically, there's no way to be unbiased.

The important thing is for people to vote and for the voting process to be as easy as possible.

And honestly it would be pretty crappy to have to choose between being a politician, or having any investments at all
What's good for the goose is good for the gander policy.
On the surface this SOUNDS good, but the problem is there are a lot of destructive companies on there that prioritize profit over the world. Ex. Nestle, BlackRock, etc. 

The only concern they should have is the future of the country and world, NOT their own holdings.
100% any new money or trades should be into a few select indexes. They can always pull out if they want to and just wait until they're out of office. Having fewer, broader categories to invest in incentivizes them to help the economy as a whole.
Yes. Corporate funding of politicians should also be outlawed. If you really wanted a good indicator of who to vote for, look at their voting record on these types of issues. If they support dark money in politics then they are someone who went to Washington to get rich and not to serve. AOC has been very outspoken about how stupid it is that members of Congress are able to own stock. She's on the right side of this issue.
Thus influencing their decisions.  They can literally ""double-dip"" on methods to profit from their investments.

For us peasants, that is called a conflict of interest and insider trading, which carries stiff penalties.  For government officials it is considered intelligent.
That's fucked up, not surprised tho
I also receive money to represent Bitcoin Inc's interests
Not American, but I wonder why crypto companies dont lobby themselves. As far as I know it is relatively cheap to do this.
If they need to invest for retirement etc. their only option should be some sort of blind trust.
Not sure either. They passed the STOCK Act in 2012 that required members of Congress to disclose any trades made by themselves, a spouse, or a dependent. This article shows 47 who have been found to have violated it in 2021. My count is 28 Republicans and 19 Democrats so it's a bipartisan problem. Laws don't matter if they aren't enforced so hopefully there are so consequences for the 47 members on that list.

The people who make the laws decided it wasn't a great idea. Oh yeah, that's them.
‚ÄúForce lawmakers‚Äù. 

Only Congress can place rules upon its self and why the fuck would they ever do that.  

Hint: It‚Äôs the same reason most major laws like the healthcare mandates and whatnot had exclusions for Congress people.  Rules for thee but not for me.
Yeah I think it's fair to say the US government has some influence over the dollar lol.
I have no issue with politicians holding stocks once they are out of office. The average length of service for a House member is 8.9 years and 11 for Senators. That isn't a very long time. Again, no one has to serve in government. It is entirely voluntary.
Big peanut was a serious issue during jimmy‚Äôs time.
Not everyone is greedy? Idk, would you really attract no one at all? As it stands the greediest sons of bitches rise to the top in politics and business.
Because they live in the US and should want it to prosper. Again, public SERVICE. You are serving your country when you run for office.
Is a 401k a retirement account or an investment? If it is an investment then my employer is lying to me because they told me it's retirement. 

Owning a home is obviously okay. If you were flipping houses then there is likely room for corruption there.

I would consider crypto an investment so I would say that you would have to sell prior to taking office.

I would say this would go for all levels of government. All levels are susceptible to corruption. For the 50th time, don't serve in government if your primary concern is investing.
Investing is totally optional right now.
Yes. That's exactly what they do. We would be much better off with a lot of AOC clones who are in government to serve their constituents rather than people who use it as an opportunity to enrich themselves. If they'd like, they could buy stocks when they leave office. 

House and Senate officials make around $175k/yr. I think they will be just fine. If government office is only for millionaires then we will have a society that only cares about what benefits millionaires. That's a big part of the problem we have right now. It's public SERVICE. People need to remember that.
No one has to serve in government. If trading stocks is more important to someone than serving in public office then they are under no obligation to do so. Every job has restrictions on what you can and can't do. We absolutely can and should tell politicians that they can't own stocks while in office.
That's a little much, but I agree with the sentiment. We send soldiers off to die and call it service. It isn't too much to ask politicians to sacrifice some comfort for the honor of serving the country.
What is crazy is that so many people believe that politicians are corrupt and we should have more honest people representing us. Then when we do have people like AOC who run for office and do try to bring transparency to government, we have those same people shitting on them and calling them stupid. It's like people hate corruption in politics but insist that nothing be done about it. It's one of the most unhealthy things I can think of.

How would they not hold opinion on centralized currencies versus a decentralized one? Shifting toward decentralized currency is opposition to the usd.

She willingly accepts centralized currency. So how is her opinion possibly unbiased? Wouldnt there be less bias if she owned both?

> Upfront as much as possible, and trying to hold oneself to some higher ideal. 

That's because she's still young, that will change over time. Just look at the vote for extra spending on the Iron Dome, it wouldn't have changed the outcome at all and it was expected of her to vote no yet she changed her vote. The only reason to vote present is because you have a moral dilemma but want to keep your options open for the future. That's the first step of becoming a real politician; compromising your ideals. She'll always champion for the right causes but in the end she'll end up voting down the line, that's the only way you can make change in the antiquated political system of the US.
She‚Äôs mad about this simply because it‚Äôs AOC position. Then again, I wouldn‚Äôt label MTG as ‚Äúsane.‚Äù
Well sure, she's the target of intense right wing media brigading, spotlighting her every move and tweet to whip their base into a frenzy at the mere mention of her name. Then, in 20 years when she tries a legit bid for the presidency, they can conjure decades of reactionary knee-jerk hatred from the right and a good chunk of right leaning independents that might swing for a less polarizing candidate.
Even when she‚Äôs right or has a valid point.  Especially on this.

I'm of the belief we're headed that way and that hedge will help me and my loved ones survive the dystopia. 

Glorification of money, trade or power are ultimately disgusting and corrupting, and pretty much no living being gets spared from greed, and those who prophetize otherwise are the filthiest greediest people around.
Damn you, this is much better

What personal narrative? I haven't mentioned a single issue or spun a narrative. You're telling quite the story though.
I'm just not American. From an outside perspective, your democracy seems to start somewhere at the right and then run through to the extreme right past batshit insane.

So to us, people like Cortez seem like the only ones with a political vision that doesn't hover between organized crime and pathologically insane.

Or phrased differently. The reason people like Cortez are considered the odd one out in American politics seems like a big factor of why the wealthiest nation in the world has a quality of life for its citizens that is well below average for a Western nation.

Your politics are so fucked that normal people are considered the weird ones.
Everything you just said is subjective. You disagree with her politically which is fair, but her doing things like avoiding stocks/crypto to remain unbiased is an objectively good thing. We need more people like her on both sides of the aisle
Are you even American?
That sounds like a balanced and well-founded opinion.
So people keep saying. Usually, people who can't come up with a single rational reason to explain their opinion.
Can you be more specific and less tinfoil hat?
paid by who?

She doesnt hold crypto, she doesnt hold stocks. Who is gonna pay her?!

Big Mother nature?
How dumb do you have to be to think anything you don't like hearing is some kind of conspiracy?
Use your words dear. You seem to be expressing strong disagreement with my opinion. But you're doing it in a way that has no content whatsoever and makes you sound like a complete moron.

It doesn't add up to a very convincing argument.
I second the user above me!
Muh Green New Deal. 

She went full-on idealist, it can‚Äôt all work but she‚Äôs brave enough to put her name to something super bold. And we need to be thinking in those kinds of extreme terms. This makes me even more bullish on AOC - we need politicians who are not afraid to make big claims and recognise the state of the climate emergency. 

Compare her to the other cynical dinosaurs.
Green New Deal was idealistic, but it‚Äôs not a fundamentally bad idea and it stresses how time sensitive it is that we radically alter our energy use, because that needs to happen. That shit needs to have happened 20 years ago, fuckers have just been too complacent and lazy to do shit and think that we can continue on as we have been without problem. Focusing only on short term pleasure over long term consequences - could only be the planets most clinically obese nation. It‚Äôs embarrassing.
Wow it's almost as idealistic as going to the Moon, building enough Highway in a few years to go from Earth to the Sun a few times over, or Mass producing enough industrial material to find an international war machine on 5 continents.

America has done things infinitely more impressive than getting to Net Zero. And this time our entire species is at risk.
Ugh how is she authoritarian? And wtf is MMT?
oh bro i salute you for saying that, but good luck with the replies haha
so you realize the neoliberals are the problem and you attack AOC for not passing legislation?

lmao so the radical left was able to unseat 9-term liberal elite joe crowley who uses all george soros money? 

always amazes me how this liberals who cry over every single thing are also able to rig elections and control the entire world 

almost like they want you to hate her so they can keep you poor and themselves rich
Besides maybe guns, what policies of hers do you disagree with? Super curious.
See, a GREAT example of that right wing propaganda at work. A rogue player that unseats a long term democrat- and they still convinced you that she is a special interests pawn.
You don‚Äôt even know what the fuck you‚Äôre saying.  You‚Äôre a brainwashed pawn whose words mean nothing
The trouble with those on the left giving her shit is that the don't realise that perfection is the enemy of good.  AOC is never going to accomplish all of her goals right off the bat so every step forwards is a positive.
Fucking hell. Liberals need to give AOC a break.
I wonder why these bills don't pass.

She is honest definitely, that's why she doen't mind and shares her not so popular views all the time, I dont always agree with her, but at least it looks like she is trying to make a better country, most others are there just to fill their money bags.
100% more than what 2%? So 4% total‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs not a high bar.
What does it mean to ‚Äòseem‚Äô more honest than the other politicians? Does that just mean we haven‚Äôt gotten to see any of the skeletons in her closet yet? 

In my way of thinking all politics are the scum of the earth and belong at the bottom of the Potomac. But that‚Äôs only because I‚Äôve seen a lot come and go and they‚Äôre all the same.

> Hate to be that guy but if you don't like the GOP today it's not that far away from the GOP 15 or 25 or 35 years ago.

It's truly not. The economic goals of the party are completely different, and the GOP is no longer the party introducing a pandemic reaction plan.
Jesus. How fucking looney bin extreme far right do you have to be to think Fox, OANN, and all their echo outlets are democrats?

Holy shit.
That doesn't make it any better. They say it's false because it wasn't a parking lot, it was a road...

Either way, she wasn't looking at kids in cages which is what she was pretending was happening. It's kind of gross for Politifact to take one small word and claim the entire thing is false. But not surprising.
>So if you use crypto its pandering and if you dont its also pandering. Basically only if its someone you like its not pandering.

You're reading someone else's comment, son.  No one said that her use or disuse of crypto makes her a panderer.  Smart money just always looks at incentives (and historical reality with almost all politicians) since we have no way to verify what AOC or any other politician does in the background.

>I dont know why you bring up worshiping politicians 

Because that's what people in here (who obviously wandered in from /r/all) are doing.  Crypto is specifically and explicitly about doing things outside the bounds of politics, intermediaries and government control.  We're not interested in your mindless partisanery and state/corporation worship.

>when talking about aoc. I dont see trucks going around with aoc flags or people denying the ‚Äúbad‚Äù stuff aoc has done.

Rent free.

Fuck Trump and trumpists.  And fuck AOC and her legion of sycophantic, populist children.
Hey there, I‚Äôm not here to make anybody angry. She has proven now that she will not use leverage she has to force positive changes to happen. This is well documented at this point, one of the more recent examples being her ‚Äúpresent‚Äù vote on the Iron Dome funding. She ‚Äúapologized‚Äù for this by explaining all of the reasons in which she did not support it in a response that is several pages worth of words but fails to ever explain exactly why it is she voted ‚Äúpresent‚Äù instead of ‚Äúno‚Äù.

I‚Äôm not trying to instigate anything here, I‚Äôm just simply pointing out she has failed to provide this new ‚Äúbreath of fresh air‚Äù to the government that many hoped she would be.
Someone who advocates spending tax money on things that don't directly benefit me.
UBI is inevitable. The world will continue to automate more and more jobs and eventually there won‚Äôt be enough left for the population and people will die. Hopefully we adopt a system like UBI before it‚Äôs too late.

There‚Äôs definitely dangers involved with it but there‚Äôs dangers ignoring it as well
No, she gets hate cause she has very far left ideas that people find devastating to the economy. She‚Äôs also a very polarizing figure on the level with people like Trump. Quit rushing to the race card unless you‚Äôre willing to say the exact same thing for politicians on the right such as Ben Carson or Condoleeza Rice who were black balled by all liberal media outlets.
Big ups for flipping blue though.
A Senator still has pull in the state and could have assisted in many ways. Rallying local governments to setup warming centers, food, water, etc. He chose instead to go on vacation, speaks volumes of his character.

Everything's following the same scam these days. Republicanism has been a scam for so long. I didn't even start following politics when I started realizing how scammy the AM commercials were in the 90s and how ridiculous their logic was at every angle.

AM radio commercials, red hat tweets, gold, test pills, phishing emails, GME/AMC, religions, all this shit is using the same scam and it's all the same userbase. You find the people who believe anything they're told (conspiracy theorists, religious, and elderly being the main groups, with a lot of crossover in all of these groups with loneliness) and then you can keep getting away with more and more.

Bonus: These groups have a REAL hard time letting their belief systems go, so you can really take them for a wild ride if you get them hooked. Narcissists would rather die than admit they believed in something foolishly.
No, I would like 2 reasonable parties actually.  More than 2 actually for a healthy democracy, but at least 2
It's because the right has had Jade Helm, BirtherGate, LaptopGate 1 & 2, QAnon, Proud Boys and Donald Trump. There really isn't much of a ""left"" in the USA to speak of, but they don't get swept up in goofy nonsense like this. You can point at some goofy antifa people, but they aren't Biden supporters and the extremes aren't welcome in the DNC. Even AOC's European style democratic socialism is too extreme (read anti-oligarchy) for her to have much sway in her party.
>How are you so comfortable making sweeping generalisations about one whole side of a political spectrum?

He said ""in general."" So he's hanging a lantern on the fact that it's a generalization that doesn't apply to everyone. That's more than what certain factions on the right do.

And he's not wrong, either. The right wing voted a meme into office.
Im sorry did my joke go over your head? And your point is? 

Oh btw thats not how phishing scammers ""work"". They work by looking like a *legitimate* notification via *mass* emails. Mass being its a numbers game to them anyway and a response rate of less than 0.2% is a success given enough bait sent if say a few million lures are cast. Grammatical errors are generally chalked up to being its not their first language since their goal is to look like a legitimate inquiry to begin with. 

Coincidentally, many politicians ALSO work by appearing *legitimate* to the *masses*. Anyway, an ""unbiased politician""  is like the scam telling you ""im not a scam"". Non sequitor.
Ah I see
Nah, I'm actually a party pooper that likes to question things that don't have evidence rather than be a gullible sheep that likes to party with the crowds just because it's the cool thing to do.
...so what I said was wrong? We all have biases and I know what mine are. All politicians lie. Do you know what your biases are? Rather than examining the fact you may have a bias in favor of her, you chose the route of dismissing it altogether because of someone's post history. You dismiss reflection and growth.
Some crypto is better money, but it is generally straight up money. Money can also be invested in. The differentiating and semantics (and probably the name calling) isn't necessary. 

Money is a loaded word with lots of emotional and ethical baggage, which I partly attribute to people being hung up on whether crypto is money or currency.
>hope that your country raised persons with strong values

That doesn't seem like it'll be enough as rich countries, poor countries, religious countries, secular countries all suffer in some way from corrupt leaders. The issue lies with the nature of humans to be self, greedy and for themselves.  
Pretty hard to overcome that.
There is definitely a right way, and we are far from it.
The politician's salaries are a pittance compared to everything else they get their hands on. Who gives a shit about a couple hundred K a year when you can make that much in a week on insider trading?
the people are in charge of changing it. we are just too scared of the unknown to act
Everyone is self-serving.
There‚Äôs actually really strong evidence that paying people well reduces the likelihood of corruption.
Conflicts of interest are a cause of bias.
That‚Äôs part of the beauty about America‚Äôs government; it‚Äôs designed to be slow to not rush into any decision based on whims. It‚Äôs easy to make bad laws fast but slow to make good laws. And it also gets rid of the emotion factor behind the laws and allows facts to prevail.
My point is how are they going to retire if you ban them from buying stocks or crypto
No not since the 70‚Äôs??? Do you have them mixed up?
That‚Äôs a weird question.
Why? Is she rich and does she avoid taxes? Do they think she's a hypocrite somehow or do they just think this concept is funny?

Your comment doesn't really explain why they found the situation so funny.
My problem isn‚Äôt with this quote, I broadly agree that federal politicians shouldnt be able to hold individual stocks. But there is a growing sentiment here that we should scrutinize ALL OF THEIR ASSETS. Which I think is redic, sure force them to invest into broad index funds and treasuries. But I see people here saying it should be illegal for them to own income generating properties. What if a real estate guy runs for a house rep? He would potentially give up his family business to be a civil servant? Seems ridiculous to me, and I think it would greatly limit the applicant pool.

On top of that there is broad AOC fanboy ism happening here.

""I guarantee she understands crypto better than 99% of politicians. She is super into gaming. And she placed in the Intel International Science Fair. She is smart and saavy, and she does her research.""

This is an actual highly upvoted quote I ran into in this thread, apparently HS science fair results are congresswoman resume worthy accolades.
Lots of people on reddit are begrudgingly democrat, because there's no way to shift the country left without voting for the moderate slop the DNC puts out. Its more of the ""The right is awful, and if you don't vote against them, even if its for some awful shit like biden, they will win out""

Edit: buys with other cryptocurrencies (not fiat)
so what are you implying? that she holds crypto with the intention to never sell or use it?

then whats the point? might as well not hold any at all
Uhhh, reread the very first question after the header on Form 1040.
[deleted]
You are required to say that you bought or hold crypto during the year. They added that last year. There are no follow up questions on it
Sure. But she does show what she does with most of her money. So unless she is doing a ton of laundry it would be hard to do. At least harder than the ones that don't disclose anything.
But if they release their tax returns, and you have to report crypto to the IRS, then we‚Äôd know if she holds crypto or not, using logic.

Unless you‚Äôre accusing her of tax evasion?

Annual salary for congress in the US is $174,000 USD.

Median household income in the United States is $68,000 USD.

No idea what it is like in Poland and Ireland but call me crazy, I bet the spread is very similar.
I'm not familiar with Poland and Ireland politics and this thread is about AOC not all politicians around the world. I agree that most politicians including a lot of of Democrats are only driven by money and smooching off the taxpayers. But AOC has always been on working class' side and pushing to raise taxes on the rich and more stimulus for the people. She doesn't trade stocks or crypto and releases her tax returns publicly. Which proves to me that she is different than most politicians and tries to be transparent at least.
Happily.
Do you live in a democracy where representatives are democratically elected and elections are verified by bipartisan committees? (like the US). If you do and still think ALL elected officials are secretly working against you, then yeah you're a conspiracy theorist.

What if they held EV stock and shit on gas cars and oil itself? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
>If they hold index funds then wouldn‚Äôt they just be incentivized for low corporate tax and no minimum wage?

I'm only extrapolating from your rationale that ""If they don't hold what's representative of the public's holdings, they will rule with ignorance."" If we take that assertion as valid, then the natural extrapolation is that they should only invest in index funds, not in specific assets like Bitcoin.

My personal opinion is that any investments they have should be in a blind trust.
> to represent some of the population they should be able to if they want. They already hold plenty of bank and other stock.

I agree with your sentiment, but the problem is that it's a GIANT conflict of interest. When representatives have a ""skin in the game"", it heavily clouds their judgement.

For example, all members of congress received a Covid19 briefing in early 2020 - before the general public knew about it. A lot of them used that information to sell certain stocks, which gave them an incredible advantage.

Similarly, a lot of representatives go easy to big tech, big pharma or companies in the energy sector, because they're heavily invested in those sectors and are also getting donations from those types of companies.
I first bought crypto in the early 2010's. Crypto is not what the white papers said...it's not a decentralized currency that can lead to freedom. As someone with a decent stake in crypto I'm confident in saying that it's been entirely overrun buy the wealthy using it as a vehicle and scammers.

It will be regulated and tbh I don't know what I expected back in 2014.
Yangs whole campaign was based on universal basic income.  Conservatives called him a communist over it. He's just as ""socialist"" as Bernie sanders.

Getting a free ticket worth 35k isn't self enrichment?

It's not that she isn't trying to get rich. She isn't investing in anything. No index funds, no stocks, no real estate, nothing. She's a terrible example for young people who are actually trying to build wealth and improve their opportunities in life.
What inside info does she need to invest in index funds? What inside info does she need to just squirrel away money into savings? Why isn't she doing any of this? 

These are the things that young Americans (who she claims to speak on behalf of) should be doing to secure their future and the future of their families. Instead of being a model representative, she's busy saying the system is rigged from her fancy overpriced DC apartment with a Tesla parked in a private garage.
Having all of the knowledge in the world is useless if she doesn't actually apply it for herself. The global economy is built on the backs of billions of individuals attempting to make the best for themselves. If she doesn't know how to individually manage her money and invest in her future, how is she supposed to know how her policy proposals will actually impact those she claims to speak for?
Yeahhhh that‚Äôs just not true

Pal, popular vote was never the point.
I never said what she should or shouldn't do. I just said that it's understandable to become biased if you have a stake in something.

I'd say crypto is closer to stocks than gold is to stocks. Who really tries to make money on investing in gold? It's just meant to preserve its value.
You're right, I was out of line. I apologize
Yeah.. I get it. sounds stupid on first look but if you think about it... crypto is here to replace money, not stocks. The statement makes no sense.

She actually explains that she is already biased against crypto by declaring it a security.
Certainly not as successful as your mother's onlyfans.

She's a social democrat, she believes in markets and has a degree in economics. If you want to learn https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy
I don‚Äôt think you know what socialism is
No idiot
There are many in office who tear up at an issue,  most of them are likely over doing it but who knows. But in this case your saying she strait out lying, I think she been gaining more and more respect from the otherside of the field because the fact that she been honest on many issues.   


Heck even in this case I think even the far right would agree she correct ""Members of Congress shouldn't hold or trade digital assets in the same way that they should steer clear from stocks,"". I think many from the far right would follow her if they were not brainwashed every 5 mins into everything wrong with the world is a left issue.
I think we may be talking about different things. What do you mean? I fail to see your point about dollars/pounds/pesos, if you have one.  The article was about an self imposed ethics rule to not own individual companies and mentions the fact that she extends the rule to include digital assets/currencies because she is on the financial services committee.
I'm actually more of a socialist than a communist, but I'm also capitalist too :)

It seems your definition of ""American"" is a bit naive. America has always been a melting pot of people and ideas and the definition of America is very fluid - it's whatever is represented by the current state - not someone's myopic nationalistic ideals from the post-WW2/cold war era.

  
I don't believe 100% of any theory though. I've been graduated from college (bachelor's degree of science) for 15 years and have been debt free (aside from a house mortgage) for 10 years. I make plenty of money to be very secure - but I would gladly be taxed higher for social programs to help others (e.g. healthcare, poverty, education - rather than support the American war-machine and payouts/bailouts to corporate America). I feel AOC represents this ideal better than most politicians - although I'm aware of her faults also.

I'm not saying China is better than America (I'd MUCH rather live here than there), I just think people treat socialism/communism like it came out of Satan's own butthole because of ww2/cold war fear and nationalistic fervor. I'm all about incorporating the best of capitalist/socialist/communist ideals together for the betterment of humans, rather than the ignorant belief that only one ideology has ALL the answers.

Also, Communism isn't responsible for ""more death than anything else in the history of the world"" - by that logic I think religion takes the cake there easily. Humans are responsible for death.  Just like guns don't kill people, people do.  And in saying that, that is why I believe it's absolutely necessary to have regulations in place; whether it's for Communism, Capitalism, or Religion.  


But I'm always glad to hear and share ideas with different people!
You should lookup ‚Äúunderemployment‚Äù

It would help to understand what she‚Äôs talking about if you‚Äôre going to attempt to say she‚Äôs wrong.
Fair enough. Which college did you graduate cum laude from?
Hahaha you just aren't smart enough to understand anything that isn't in meme format.
No, you're just brainwashed.

‚Ä¶she‚Äôs uneducated.

Okay someone‚Äôs clearly living in an echo chamber. Your confirmation bias is showing

I‚Äôd rather a politician have X-1 financial biases rather than X. Obviously the ideal number is 0 though
Crypto is far more at risk of regulations that will affect the market drastically though. News affects it more
Who the fuck *wants* to be a ""crypto person""? The very notion should make you shiver.
that is literally the main entity that tracks book sales
I didn't say anything regarding that.

I was just replying to the point he made regarding her writing a book, which would then be snatched up in bulk by ""Democrat doners"".

That's an objectively false statement, because the NY Times best-seller list tracks these types of fake bulk purchases
Lol, did you feel smart posting that?
I'll just put her in a hot wash.
Okay dude
I disagree with you, but her policies aside, you have to admit that she did the right thing by reducing her potential bias
Hmm I guess I haven‚Äôt heard her demonize folks that make decent money (different from extreme wealth). As a tech worker myself, tech companies definitely get away with a lot of stuff they shouldn‚Äôt, like selling/abusing your data. I think our government in general is woefully inept and understanding the damages of tech companies but she at least seems to understand it better than most.
Gotta love downvotes from the progressive boot lickers. Remember when she posed in front of an empty fence for publicity? Oh right. We don‚Äôt remember her idiocy.
AOC releases her tax returns so it's public information
Even then, owning nothing, you‚Äôd potentially be biased toward those that own things. That‚Äôs why this is dumb.
I think politics should be so far removed from influencing business that their finances don‚Äôt matter.
That we are not courting new regulations or changes on fiat is not the point. It‚Äôs that to the extent one values fiat, that potentially biases them against crypto. So she hasn‚Äôt avoided lacking bias when it comes to handling politics about crypto by not holding bitcoin.
üòÅ glad I could help
As much as I'd love to engage in a pointless conversation with a conspiracy nutjob in this sub, I'll pass.
Its not. Communism can exist in a democracy or a dictatorship.

>Communism is a political and economic system that seeks to create a classless society in which the major means of production, such as mines and factories, are owned and controlled by the public.
She is not a communist üòÇ 
You watch too much alt right and Fox news.
By making a conscious, concrete effort to reduce her biases, she‚Äôs at least *comparatively* better than the others *in that respect.* Can we agree on that?
Damn I typo‚Äôed the shit out of that. 

Im curious as to why you believe someone can be unbiased about crypto while actively holding crypto
Wow I typoed the shit out of that. 

Im curious about how you believe someone can be unbiased about crypto while holding crypto?

I don‚Äôt believe senators or any politician for that matter should be able to hold assets while in office

> I'm all for people paying a fair share. But the extremely wealthy are always going to find ways around whatever tax burden is placed on them

You can see how the immediate defeatism is not really distinguishable from someone who doesn't recognize or want to fix the problem?  

The rich often do pay what they are required to, it's just that their tax burden has been drastically reduce the last 70 years.  They lobbied and bribed HARD for that.  It's not a coincidence they did that instead of just evading taxes.  

Fixing the tax code does help, you can tell by how hard they are resisting it being fixed


> And when the plans to tax the rich fail-- who's next?

The middle class is bearing more of the tax burden for exactly the reason you're fighting.  We gave up taxing the rich and now they pay less taxes than the rest of us

Nobody is unbiased, it's part of the human condition. The goal is to do what you can to be as close to unbiased as you can be.
Are you saying one Tesla as in a car (that‚Äôs how I read it ) or one Tesla as in the stock?

If it‚Äôs the car, then she isn‚Äôt holding it as an investment. Tesla‚Äôs stock can fluctuate all it wants, she still owns that car and it‚Äôs value won‚Äôt be affected. If she holds Bitcoin, then the success of Bitcoin as a coin will directly affect her, and may come into consideration if she has to vote on a law that might affect the worth of Bitcoin one way or another.

Same as how buying an iPhone is different than holding stock in Apple. Signing a right to repair law is unlikely to effect the resale value of your iPhone, but will certainly affect the value of the stock you hold.

That‚Äôs a fair point but I think that‚Äôs mainly because China has banned and unbanned crypto 3(?) times this year? I think the market has decided that China is going through with it but that is a really good point
Thing is it's about what's actually happening, the reality of it. You can't practically make one plus one equal three, but crypto *is* primarily being used and traded as a investment vehicle.

I don't think she lacks understanding about what cryptocurrency was originally intended for at all, but the reality of the matter is that it's being used as an investment vehicle. Legislation is based off of what's happening and what people are doing, if someone's 'misusing' something and legislation is the best way to go, it doesn't matter what that thing was originally designed for. Only how it's being used.

Cryptos just aren't a practical currency yet. And given that there's so many of them in competition, if legislation was introduced or passed that formalized one or more cryptos as a more viable and/or practical currency nationwide, legislators that have holdings in any of those would have a clear advantage over civilians.

I feel like 90% of people don't care about the philosophy of it.
I totally get that, and I'm the same way. Even still I'm hoping that in the future we begin to see them more and more as valuable currency.
I feel like the atmosphere is finally changing. I'm kind of the opposite of you. I, of course, hold some btc and other crypto and it has made me money, but I've never heavily invested in it for the purpose of getting rich. I strongly believe in the philosophy behind what blockchains can offer to the world, both financially and otherwise. I think most people still don't understand exactly how a blockchain even works. That's changing with up-and-coming ""web3"" developments and exposure.
Love the honesty.
> How is this such a difficult thing to get done?!

> I only ever cared about getting rich and never cared about the philosophy of it.


There, there is your answer. Because too many people feel this way about life in general.

*I don't care about anything except getting rich*
How did you get into bitcoin 7 years ago if you were never interested in the founding philosophy or potential real-world impact of the technology?
Bought 1.5 for 60 bucks forever ago. Cashed out .13 not to long ago and that held me over on car repairs and mods for awhile.
so you‚Äôre the guy who sold the infamous pizza
Hack incoming
You liar.... bitcoin is a scam, it's rat poison squared plus two lol
Perhaps that's the secret to diamond hands - the desire to be rich.

I on the other hand loved the philosophy of bitcoin. And I was paper handed for a long time
Most people are in the same boat\*
That **does** make me feel better. Wow, thanks!
Do you still DCA, or did you buy a chunk early?
I used to buy/sell goods for btc all the time but it was 5-10 years ago maybe even gamble a bit with seals ;)
I think about both but it's never struck me as being that useful as a currency except in edge cases.
Ur a fool mate
Genuinely have wondered this. What arguments or evidence convinced you 7 years ago that it could make you rich?
If I invest in fiat, I need 00‚Äôs to start.  And the returns from the bank are crap.  I started with 50.  And dca half that each week.  And that will get me to a sum to invest that is a less risky option.  I took gains with Shib & loopring as a start.  can‚Äôt afford the sums I see in here, but then the learning is important for me.   Which comes to the point even if you knew shit about fuck, it wouldn‚Äôt matter as everyone is different.  AOC has a moral and regulatory path to follow.  A dad of 2 young kids may see this as an on-ramp.  An ape just sees gains.  It‚Äôs a broad church of risk.
People *do* HODL fiat.

That's what all those old people with safes full of benjamins are doing
You literally cant do 2 of those things
Unless you‚Äôre the type to store your money under the mattress, Haha. 

Unlike losing value on inflationary currency, you are maintaining and even increasing your purchasing power over time. (Provided that the increase in value beats the rate of inflation at minimum.) I wouldn‚Äôt mind hiding my Bitcoin or ETH under the mattress for a rainy day. (Although I do have multiple exit points if they hit certain amounts.) I wouldn‚Äôt save all of it ‚Äúunder my mattress‚Äù though.
Since when is nano a stablecoin
What fucks me up is when Bitcoin comes up in any subs except for a few CC subs, hundreds of people just jump on it and screech about how it's melting the planet and how it's a ponzi scheme. And they get massively upvoted.

Is willful ignorance really still that celebrated?...
Was looking for this comment, how is it classified elsewhere? Do any country recognize it as a currency?
That's like saying 'food is fattening and you'll have a heart attack at some point. Such a scam'
I'm honestly excited for this 'round' of users to go away. If Ihave to read or hear about someone wanting to buy 'shares' of 'ethers' again, I'm gonna kick my cat.
Money is a medium of exchange. When your currency becomes a commodity your economy is going to hell in a handbasket
The thing about forex is that every currency pair is directly relative to the other, and indirectly to every other pair. The strength of the currency from the country dictates its rate. Bitcoin doesnt hold a value that can be measured with external factors like a fully functional economy. Ideally, all currencies in the world go out the window, and bitcoin is used as a standard.
The only thing that would change is how expensive something is in every country.. For example if a new car in country A costs 0.75 BTC, the cost in country B (where the economy is stronger and the car is domestically produced), the cost could be 0.65 BTC.

Guess who isnt winning in the second scenario? Every single institution, corporation, organization, comission etc. that works with, depends on, and gains from a centralized government currency
If you want to break into how cryptos create real world value, look up 'smart contract usecase' in google, maybe with ethereum added in

Or check out [this](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions) link for some of how IBM is utilizing it. It's actually quite fascinating, even if the speculative investors are mostly CHUDs who don't really 'get it' lol. Anyway, it's rare to find a curious person on here which is why i'm shooting the links, Cheers mate
üò≥
So you can use it as a currency(if you want) AND use it as an investment vehicle(if you want)

The dollar example i posted is valid.Hundreds of million of people in the world hold a currency that inflates away at a double digit rate per year. Yet they are forced to use it as a currency. Some of them use a stronger currency with lower inflation (USD) to escape part of that inflation.

BTC will do that for ALL currencies, including the dollar itself.  


Also censorship resistance, not confiscable money, its a thing.
People need food, shelter, etc so they'd have to spend somewhere but up until btc money has never been this divisible to where you can still utilize it no matter how much it's worth. The price stability will come in time.
Bitcoin is absolutely special. It's revolutionary, it's self sovereignty, it's Hard Money. Real value, real work preserved through a computer algorithm instead of some central government who is stealing money through poor economic decisions that reward the exact people who have ruined for everyone already. 2009 was the biggest theft in the world and 2022 will be much worse. Bitcoin fixes that.
Not criticism just my 2 cents. Sorry you felt the need to explain yourself.
I mean does it need to be stable to be a currency? Obviously stability is part of the connotation but bitcoin‚Äôs objectively used as a medium of exchange and at this point a lot of places accept it. It‚Äôs certainly unconventional but I feel like its use in that way makes it more than a speculative asset
> unless you bring out the tired ""but the mighty us government""

If no one wants it, no one wants it. It has value because the United states says it has value due to X, Y, and Z. You say that it is because the US, its government and its military enforce that. Like it is some unalienable virtue that no other type of money can have. 

Akin to the USD, BTC has value due to the current players saying it has value due to A, B, and C. A, B, and C doesn't have to be anything like X, Y, and Z. WoW gold has value ffs. Millions of things have a tradable, quantitative value that aren't govt backed fiat, spendable on goods and services to varying levels and opportunities

Edit:

> It is the power of the state in enforcing legal tender. Try and pay your taxes in Bitcoin and see how hard it gets you.

El Salvador considers it money, is spendable as money, and can be used to pay taxes... soo.... yeah. The world is bigger than the United States
I mean most people are treating it as an investment asset anyways
I mean by serious economies that matter on a world scale
sick burn. how long does it take your short bus to get to school?
If we‚Äôre only talking about only bitcoin in this specific moment in time, you‚Äôre right. But my point is that there have been times through history where the dollar, and other international currencies for that matter, have been incredibly volatile‚Äîat one point so much so that we abandoned the gold standard entirely to help recover.

The dollar has the benefit of already being the premier currency worldwide, with loads of regulations to decrease volatility. Today the stock market is regulated from the top down to resist drastic swings and prevent crashes and panic. There‚Äôs no such priority given to crypto right now, probably because there are tons of investors from regulated fiat markets that love being able to take advantage of the volatility. If that changed and crypto was afforded similar treatment as fiat, there‚Äôs no reason it couldn‚Äôt replace it and be equally or even less volatile.
Nah, but it‚Äôs a valid reason as to why Bitcoin isn‚Äôt a currency
This doesnt get talked about much for whatever reason. Imo, they knew something was coming.
I‚Äôm genuinely wondering the answer but how do we not know if it was a coincidence? 

Was that the only time airlines were shorted or was it an amount that was crazy more than before? I‚Äôm not saying I believe either way. I would just need more info than someone shorted a stock once and something bad happened.
They knew something was going to happen. Just didn‚Äôt know where
Damn
But why don't we know who this was. They are exchange traded securities there has to be a record of which broker sold them and where the proceeds went to. And then who bought the stock to cover the short position.
Wow I had never seen this.. thanks for Sharing!
More proof it was an insider job
Isn‚Äôt this the premise of the show Billions? Was wondering what real life scenario it was based on
It's quite literally illegal for government employees to do that.
Can't seem to reply to your other reply...

>Government employees, yes. Congressman, yes. Senators, no. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK_Act

I feel like there may be a lack of knowledge here. A Senator *is* a congressman. The Congress is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, so if something applies to ""congressmen"", it applies to all 535 of them (100 Senators and 435 Representatives).

It's also worth noting that STOCK also applies not just to congressmen, but to employees of various levels and of all three branches.
What I don‚Äôt get is why not just retire and spend your damn retirement money! Once I hit my retirement goal, I‚Äôll be walking out the door of where ever I work.
I thought about using it, but I don't like that idiom very much, and, sad as it is, when I do use it, I end up having to explain what it means about half the time, which beats the point of using an idiom at all.

Ahhh-sooooü§î
I don't really disagree with your sentiment but I will say that right now might be a bit different for a while because it's so new that it's still in the radical phase of regulation where we dont even know how it will fit into our society yet
Except that would be owning stakes in a company. I think you'd find their family members owning a lot of this stuff instead.
Joe Manchin owns a fucking coal plant
I suppose so. But we all know how they are
Pesky politicians man, can‚Äôt be trusted lol. Hopefully she will keep true to her word
I do wish there was a counter balance though.. In the current political climate though banning seems to be a real threat. But many older politicians who want to ban it have likely never had experience with crypto. So they're uninformed and feel threatened by a technology they do not understand. How would we go about informing politicians of something new they are not allowed to use?

Nah it‚Äôs the people who elect them that are the real culprits.
Vote in your primaries, general elections, and presidential elections!

You get what you deserve. Even by not going to the polls. Idk why people are so braindead to the possibility that you literally have the power to vote them out and to elect them as your party's representative in the primaries before the general election.

Instead everyone takes this stance and reduces the power of the people when they actively choose not to go to the polls and allow spoiled incumbents and shitty representatives to continue to enter the system and further erode trust in the system.

Do you all not see the vicious cycle???

Why don't you try voting in the primaries so you can elect your candidate before they go to the general election. So you can actually have a say in someone who wants to fix all the issues you blame politicians for. Pick better representatives!

Im tired of seeing and hearing this apolitical stance and echo chamber of ""fUcK pOliTicAns, fUcK gOveRnMeNt."" You literally get what you deserve.

Fucking vote in your primaries, general elections, and presidential elections!

Dumb fucks.
Imagine how peaceful this world would be if we hadn't all those corrupt assholes.
Brave statement
Sure I guess. Almost every single politician owns stocks. In fact, many Republican Senators were caught dumping all their stocks after they were briefed on COVID-19 for the first time, which was blatant insider trading. My point is who cares? If a politician is allowed to own stocks, why wouldn't they? 

Also, my bigger point is, the clear bias within the Crypto community is so blatant it stinks. Democrat owns stocks = corrupt witch. Republican owns Bitcoin = Hero & legend, fuck yeah!! 

You are either biased or your not. Most people are.

You‚Äôre saying politicians don‚Äôt have influence over the value of dollar holdings, or you don‚Äôt understand how that affects their incentives by the same means as other conflicts of interest?
Of course it is. If you hold one asset(such as legal tender) over others, you're biased.
They should be able to hold just not have direct control over it.

Serious question, are lawmakers and other political leaders eligible to invest in the Thrift Savings Plan?
Or if they do it should be something that's a blanket public benefit, like school/infrastructure bonds
I think it‚Äôs more dangerous to have people in policy making position who don‚Äôt understand the tech or even basic economics.
Yeah, but that‚Äôs literally the point of a blind trust, which is what I advocated for above. it prevents them from having any active trading role in the investments within the trust, and even prevents them from seeing what is inside the trust. It has to be managed by a third party.

AOC earns 174k a year as per an article I just googled. A new grad in Finance or Software Engineering earns that or more as soon as they graduate and join a job.

It took a second for me to look through his wiki. 

There's no way [Burr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burr) should be in prison for [that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal). 

He was almost certainly gagged. 

In speaking on the dangers *known*. Everyone at a mid-high level **knowing**. 

Seriously, not to be to tongue in cheek. 

But, you... Haven't been watching the monthly to tri-monthly updates?

Ie by

- Dr. Fauci or Staff

- NIH Director or Staff

Gives an interview. 

Usually on 

- Threat assessment of global pandemics.

- Updates pertaining to flight restrictions, etc.

I've seen a few ""general"" knowledge

- ""Updates""

  ""Forums""

  ""Reviews""

Surrounding groundbreaking moonshot-level programs.

Typically ""restricted"" research on ongoing treatments. 

Ie

- ""Restricted"" 

For not reaching the publishing stage. As it takes decades to scientifically pass review.

Since all of ^ this. 

Is almost guaranteed to be heard around the ""watercooler"" in Congress.

I'd scrutinize [Burr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burr) for 

- *Inaction*

On expected knowledge.

As that opens a can-o-worms. Into willful ignorance a US Senator shouldn't possess.
Yes, their point was that it's enforceable for the masses, why don't we apply the same to our lawmakers that have privileged information?
Sorry, typo. Should say large cap. Saying they should only be allowed index funds would undoubtedly give them large cap indeces.
So could literally any person she talks to. You're grasping at straws bud
No one with half a brain would go into politics if they were paid the median wage. It would be full of fools and trust fund babies, which come to think of it sounds like what we have now. 

I don‚Äôt disagree with you about raising the median wage, I just don‚Äôt think this would be the way to get it done.
yeah seriously, I dont need them to hold all their assets in cash (that would have its own issues) I just don't want them trading on insider info. And the whole blind trust is bullshit for most of them.
They can still profit by selling it before a big move in the whole market and then rebuy afterwards at a discount, like they did with the pandemic.

I think the real solution would be a 90(180?) day delay on any stock trading they do.
I see what you're saying, however it's not that much of a sacrifice. You want to serve as a senator/MP or whatnot? Cool, you can't do X, Y, Z though... do you agree? No? Too big an ask? Cool, have a nice day then.

The Catholic Church expects you to not fuck women if you want to be a cardinal. These are privileged positions and a sacrifice to hold one isn't too much to ask
yeah same here...as much as I dont like most politicians due to how the system has become corrupted, I also dont feel it fair that they should not be allowed to invest where they please. As long as there is some oversight and checks and balances to ensure no foul play or insider trading happens then I am good with that. At the end of the day the corrupt ones get around it by using loopholes anyway. I rather we have a transparent system instead of one where people are gaming the system and going through loopholes.
Yeah i mean ""not wanting the stock market to crash"" is a pretty reasonable way to operate too. It doesn't mean you're corrupt.
Isn‚Äôt that second one essentially a blind trust, like they are SUPPOSED to be doing now?
I wonder if there could be a single fund specifically designed to represent the health of the economy, and have only that open to politicians' investment. I don't know how it could be kept free from corruption though.

Even that, though, isn't perfect because it still acts as an incentive to put economy ahead of people.
I agree. There are many solutions to this. The fact that someone like Pelosi or McConnel is able to sell of millions of dollars before the COVID crash because they knew what was about to happen is ridiculous.
However there‚Äôs a chance that might affect how they vote on foreign policy positions that would negatively affect the U.S market
I'm like, idk if I'm okay with politicians investing or not, but if I was okay with it, forcing them to have an American only, blind-managed index/ETF, or something; that would be the way to go. At least then their financial interests will at least lean towards American business.
Agree on that
Regulate the regulators! They'll [never see that coming](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-obstruction-of-justice-comey-1267267/)!
They should be well paid, but fuck letting them do the side shit. Teachers put up with shit pay and stress because they want to do hood. Same for nurses, etc. Politicians should be in it for the service too.... maybe less frauds and ego maniacs would get into politics if this sort of restriction was in place
That would be very interesting, sadly it would Probably lead to further corruption
The Supreme Court Case in Citizens United really was the nail in the coffin. It literally led to corporations being allowed to fund political speech without any limitations.
This is precisely why we're not seeing much regulation when it comes to near monopolistic companies who have destroyed/bought out nearly all competition in their sectors.

There should be some smart contract in place that gets politicians to hold accountable for the shit they promise when running for office.
Legal lobbying and lack of term limits. These are my major gripes with the current system
Bullish on AOC
> Politicians should also be outlawed.
I‚Äôm not paying tax until that and a few other things happen. It‚Äôs a travesty
This is never going to happen.

For one politicians are the ones writing the laws. They aren't going to write laws that knee cap them.

The job is nothing but wheeling and dealing. Humans are humans and they all have their self interests.

I think the best thing we can ask for is full blown transparency. I think having them all of them having to show their investments when they run and are in office would help at least identify that candidate 1 is a tech shill and candidate 2 is a big pharma shill.

What this tells me about AOC is either she's an idiot or a liar or a combination of both.
It‚Äôs ridiculous that lobbyist exist. That sole fact that they do, shows how corrupt our government is.

As we entered the spez, the sight we beheld was alien to us. The air was filled with a haze of smoke. The room was in disarray. Machines were strewn around haphazardly. Cables and wires were hanging out of every orifice of every wall and machine.  
At the far end of the room, standing by the entrance, was an old man in a military uniform with a clipboard in hand. He stared at us with his beady eyes, an unsettling smile across his wrinkled face.  
""Are you spez?"" I asked, half-expecting him to shoot me.  
""Who's asking?""  
""I'm Riddle from the Anti-Spez Initiative. We're here to speak about your latest government announcement.""  
""Oh? Spez police, eh? Never seen the likes of you."" His eyes narrowed at me. ""Just what are you lot up to?""  
""We've come here to speak with the man behind the spez. Is he in?""  
""You mean spez?"" The old man laughed.  
""Yes.""  
""No.""  
""Then who is spez?""  
""How do I put it..."" The man laughed. ""spez is not a man, but an idea. An idea of liberty, an idea of revolution. A libertarian anarchist collective. A movement for the people by the people, for the people.""  
I was confounded by the answer. ""What? It's a group of individuals. What's so special about an individual?""  
""When you ask who is spez? spez is no one, but everyone. spez is an idea without an identity. spez is an idea that is formed from a multitude of individuals. You are spez. You are also the spez police. You are also me. We are spez and spez is also we. It is the idea of an idea.""  
I stood there, befuddled. I had no idea what the man was blabbing on about.  
""Your government, as you call it, are the specists. Your specists, as you call them, are spez. All are spez and all are specists. All are spez police, and all are also specists.""  
I had no idea what he was talking about. I looked at my partner. He shrugged. I turned back to the old man.  
""We've come here to speak to spez. What are you doing in spez?""  
""We are waiting for someone.""  
""Who?""  
""You'll see. Soon enough.""  
""We don't have all day to waste. We're here to discuss the government announcement.""  
""Yes, I heard."" The old man pointed his clipboard at me. ""Tell me, what are spez police?""  
""Police?""  
""Yes. What is spez police?""  
""We're here to investigate this place for potential crimes.""  
""And what crime are you looking to commit?""  
""Crime? You mean crimes? There are no crimes in a libertarian anarchist collective. It's a free society, where everyone is free to do whatever they want.""  
""Is that so? So you're not interested in what we've done here?""  
""I am not interested. What you've done is not a crime, for there are no crimes in a libertarian anarchist collective.""  
""I see. What you say is interesting."" The old man pulled out a photograph from his coat. ""Have you seen this person?""  
I stared at the picture. It was of an old man who looked exactly like the old man standing before us. ""Is this spez?""  
""Yes. spez. If you see this man, I want you to tell him something. I want you to tell him that he will be dead soon. If he wishes to live, he would have to flee. The government will be coming for him. If he wishes to live, he would have to leave this city.""  
""Why?""  
""Because the spez police are coming to arrest him.""

No politicians should own houses or they‚Äôll be biased to the real estate market.

They also can‚Äôt drive gas cars because we wouldn‚Äôt want them to be biased against electric automakers.

There‚Äôs definitely a logical point where this doesn‚Äôt make sense anymore, but some limitations may make sense. 

It‚Äôs just not as simple as limiting them to things they have no influence over. They‚Äôre government. They influence almost everything.
Idealism doesn‚Äôt go anywhere. It‚Äôs great we have aoc and maybe 8 others in the entirety of govt who may be honest, but the rest aren‚Äôt. As a non participant they have no motivation to protect the market, or the investors, or the market makers. If you‚Äôre ruling from a ‚Äúmajority rules‚Äù standpoint you‚Äôll be stepping on minority opinion holders at every turn. Imo motivation needs to be in place to do the right thing, or the right thing won‚Äôt get done, only the most politically expedient, as we‚Äôve seen in practice time and again.

I think you'll find this rag reputable. But he didn't really sell it. 

I could see making a case for making politician's setting up blind/irrevocable trust to house their assets/block access to change them while they're in office. But that would be the most expensive route for politicians personally(lawyer fees). 

Again you'd be best to have them take all public equity and put it into a general index fund/treasury instruments, this would eliminate most market arbitrage they could perform with insider info. Where it gets messy as always is private equity as no one really knows what they have unless they publicly disclose it, and forcing divestiture there can be VERY TRICKY. I think at the end of the day Transparency is the most important part, we have enough to know its broken today. But this overreacting reaction to ""MAKE THEM SELL EVERYTHING"" just does not work practically.
A peanut farm is a business not an asset like real estate or currency/cryptocurrency. Having a second home isn't a conflict of interest, but owning a business is.
You‚Äôre comparing USD to regulation over thousands of crypto currencies and new and developing technologies.

Your comparison does not equate at all.
Are you serious? You don't make money from holding USD like you do with crypto. In fact, USD is constantly going down in value due to inflation. It isn't an investment like crypto is, it's actually functioning like a currency. So holding it doesn't bias someone because no one expects USD to go up on value like crypto does or treats it like an investment. It's just a tool to be used as medium of exchange. It's like expecting someone to be biased towards hammer manufacturers because they own a hammer. The value of your hammer doesn't go up even if hammer manufacturers are doing well.

Hmm
""the rabble""?? who are you trying to sound like, lucille bluth? lex luthor? fuck I can smell the pee bottles from here
She's pushing for elected officials not to be directly influenced by the shit they can own and trade. Your dumbass want to shit on that concept. I bet with the same dog breath you'll bitch about Nancy Pelosi inside trading.
Lol every conservative regurgitates the same nonsensical talking points about her that they get from Fox News, and you accuse people that don‚Äôt hate her as falling for propaganda üòÇ
Username check out.
People think she is decent cuz she doesn‚Äôt like rich people. That‚Äôs about it.
Exactly. They are all politicians.
it‚Äôs funny isn‚Äôt it! Some of these goobs would have voted for Elizabeth Warren too despite the fact she wants to screw over crypto‚Ä¶all because of what team she plays for.  Oh well, If they want to take up for habitual liars, that‚Äôs on them. That old saying, FAFO.
Aoc cares about you. Believe it or not.
What propaganda? I just stated my opinion.
If anything, there is *far* more anti-AOC propaganda out there than pro-AOC.

Literally the entire right is organized against her, constantly posting fake news, fake quotes, out of context information. Plus, half the fucking left doesn't even like her.

Yet somehow, she's *benefitting* from propaganda, in your eyes. What a joke.
Is there nothing more fragile than a republiklan? No, I don't think there is
Actually she lost all of it on a boating accident
[removed]
That's because crypto trailer is full of moronic Libertarians who don't even understand the basics of how government functions
Because if you demonize her and called her an idiot maybe your own supporters won't take five minutes to actually read what she has to say and realize that life would be way better for them if maybe one or two of those things got implemented.
It's because the media has made you think that, anyway. Where's the actual evidence that she's the worst? What about this shit from literally last year taking advantage of the public with advanced non-public COVID knowledge? Plenty of congresspeople do this shit, and it's bad, but Pelosi is so overly demonized, that it's obviously just from political smearing.
But wouldn‚Äôt that also apply to other governments of the world? Why do US politics have so much importance? You don‚Äôt see me bashing on French conservatives or German liberals on /politics or some other bullshit group lol
It‚Äôs so dumb dude, both republicans and democrats are dumb. They both do dumb shit.
""Facts dont care about your feelings""

Come on, show some proof. Otherwise, you are just talking out of your butt. It doesnt matter if you feel she does, it matters if she has a history of lying about what she has and has not. 

Critically think yo.
Curiosity killed the cat.
It‚Äôs incredible to see people so delusional and full of hate like you. I guess the only consolation is that you‚Äôre more than likely never going to raise a family.
He's not. He doesn't see the misogyny and racism against her to warrant as fake
I mean, I‚Äôve seen plenty of conservative opinions and intentional misleading articles on her. But there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt a politician in DC who doesn‚Äôt have those, nevermind one who has become face of the future for their party. I‚Äôve seen as much ‚Äúfalse media‚Äù on almost every politician of similar prominence. 

I was wondering if there‚Äôs a particular conspiracy they were referring to. Not sure why I‚Äôm being downvoted.

Nursing student here, can confirm that nursing homes here are by and large incredibly sad facilities and patients really aren‚Äôt getting the compassionate care they need
Pretty sure grandmas don‚Äôt get shanked in nursing homes
Not exactly. Prisons abuse you ~~for free~~ on thy taxpayers dime. 

Nursing homes charge exorbitant amounts is money to abuse you.
How ironic/terrible/sad is it that my highest upvoted comment on r/cc is for mocking the deplorable conditions of American senior care.

Gimme moons so I can afford better care for my relatives!!
You‚Äôre right but it‚Äôs still possible to get things done as a progressive, Bernie for example always sneaks progressive stuff into unrelated bills. Or she could work with the libertarians on certain issues like ending the wars or drug legalization but she chooses to not to for some reason
[deleted]
Yeah, that's exactly why you don't understand the politics here.  You think the stuff on /r/politics is real.  It would be like getting all your news about Europe from the Daily Mail.  

I promise you that what you've read about the US isn't accurate, and there's loads of things you haven't heard about AOC specifically.
To be fair, so is everything they‚Äôre replying to.
That is a good thing, but one good thing does not make the overall appeal good.
Looks like he's a teenager from Slovenia.
Good that i am not. I can dislike people from both political spectrums and not blindly agreeing with one side while religiously hating the other. In Usa nowadays substance does not matter. Only blue vs red no matter what opinion
also brain rot
Last week I tried to point out the socioecnomic correlation of US counties and vaccination rates.

Their brains are so broken they saw the word wealth and immediately start on with their programming about the ""Hollywood Elite."" You can't even converse with a conservative anymore unless they're just over the age of 60 and too stuck in their ways but at least not on social media.
Go look at her views on bail and criminals. Waukesha is a good example. If it were not for stupid progressive policies, the killer would not have been out running over people.  There are a few reasons Democrats got hurt this past November's election and one of them is downplaying crime.
She's literally an actress. She was a waitress that went to an acting gig to hire people they could mold into politicians. Now she just says the talking points they want with a cute voice and face. It's just theatre
It's one thing to be idealistic. It's another to show a complete lack of understanding of modern industry intricacies and dependencies. This is just like someone putting their life savings into BTC without looking at any data, such as the downside risks, volatility, historical supports, etc. Pulling shit like this just makes her come off as an ignoramus.
Her entire policy platform is trying to give government more power over people's daily lives. How is she not an authoritarian?
How is she not? She's a leftist, leftists are by definition authoritarian.

MMT is modern monetary theory that just says print money to cover government deficits. Read what Paul Krugman, prominent left wing economist, has to say about it.
Didn‚Äôt attack her. Not every disagreement is an attack. It‚Äôs not even a disagreement. Just an observation
You can't reason a man out of a position that they didn't reason themselves into.

Perhaps you agree with them but it's really hard to not see a group of people recruiting, mentoring, sponsoring, and financing candidates in targeted elections as anything other than ""special interests"".
you have to wait for Fox and OANN to tell them the answer to that question.
Not the guy you asked, but I dislike basically everything in her platform
Because she is... she was put in place by Marxists who want America turned upside down. They literally held a popularity contest and she ""won"". She fit their ""mold"" perfectly. Young, attractive, witty Latina who has shit for brains. She was planted ya dumb shit. Do some real research.

""Saikat Chakrabarti, now Ocasio-Cortez‚Äôs chief of staff, and Corbin Trent, now her communications director, began soliciting names of working-class leaders who might be willing to run. In the end, they got some 11,000 nominations from across the country. One of them was a letter from Gabriel Ocasio-Cortez, 26, touting his older sister Alexandria. She fit the mold exactly.""

The media covers up the left's lies. Always has.
Yep, I'm a leftie and even I think she goes way too far sometimes. But I still have more respect for her than anyone else in Congress. I 100% trust her when she says she doesn't hold any stocks or crypto.
I know she's nuts, but it's also why I like Marjorie Taylor Greene more than most of congress as well. If you listen to McConnell or Pelosi or Schumer speak, I'm not sure if they believe what they say, or if they just say whatever they calculate is best for their career. Even if they say insane thing sometimes, I'll always prefer honest politicians who say what they actually think.
She's honest about trashing the wealthy but wears thousand dollar dresses. I don't think she's smart enough to invest properly in crypto or otherwise, that's why she fine with detaching herself from that venture. 

If the issue was detaching from vera Wang dresses while strutting her booty down Saks fifth, she'll be up shits creek
No, mostly because she discloses a lot about herself and what she does. If she does have skeletons, they are harder to do since she discloses so much.   

Not saying she might not have dirt.
Bruh it was proven to be true. Doesn't matter if it comes from shitty people. Truth is the truth. Sorry it hurts so much apparently that it makes you bury head in sand
I agree with that actually which is pretty depressing

Lol, 
> Crypto is specifically and explicitly about doing things outside the bounds of politics, intermediaries and government control. 

What fantasy world do you live in that any government, from whatever portion of the political spectrum, will not try to have any control or regulations over crypto. 

Government/laws/regulations are all about allowing or not allowing something. In order to make sure any government doesnt try to control crypto (or anything), you need to be involve in their policy making, which includes the policy to leave crypto alone. 

> Because that's what people in here (who obviously wandered in from /r/all) are doing. 

where? What do you actually consider worshiping a politician to be?

> We're not interested in your mindless partisanery and state/corporation worship.

More of your fantasy world is showing. And again, what worship are you talking about?

> Rent free.

You brought up worshipping politicians, I gave you an example of actual worshiping of a politician. 

> Fuck Trump and trumpists. And fuck AOC and her legion of sycophantic, populist children.

Lol.
I dont buy that for a second.   I know people who have taken one look at her and hated her immediately, and I know it happens on large scale in this country.
Why, ossoff and warnock have done shit and the government ratings are lower than when trump was in office lol.
No dude she is a minority and a female  that is why, you got  stupid mother fuckers like gosar,boebert and the fool from Georgia ms Greene in congress.
The conspiracy sub specifically absorbed a lot of Trumpets when T_D got shut down. They all migrated there. Even back in like 2015 the front page of conspiracy was your run of the mill conspiracy stuff. Now it's T_D 2.0
Which is funny because it used to be a left idealist hivemind uncovering right bush era corruption.
Never thought there was overlap with meme coins.
Interesting take.
Lol nice
Username does not check out.
Well if all politicians lie, shouldn't you be politically agnostic? If you're against a certain ideaology (leftism) because some politicians told you it's bad, then you're trusting these politicians to tell the truth, right? So by your own logic, they're lying and leftism ISN'T bad. Conversely, they're lying about the utopia that is conservatism? They're lying to you about the dangers of BLM, abortion, gun safety, yadda yadda.

What you really are, is spineless and hypocritical. Unable to make your own decisions, and just start shouting LIARS when someone you disagrees with challenges your viewpoints. But honestly, these are core values of US conservatives anyway...
There are certain european countries with decent politicians.
So what is the right way?
Yeah I don‚Äôt disagree with you there
Tax havens say otherwise the rich always want to get richer
Yes I know, thank you
Its not always good to be slow when things need to change. Take climate change as an example - there is far too much lobbying to maintain profits for companies rather than looking at actual issues/solutions. Look at the opioid crisis. Massive lobbying and corruption again. American politics has a lot of issues - the financial power of lobby groups is detrimental to society, all for the benefit of a few very wealthy groups
The same way that rest of us do wait we can‚Äôt most of us are stuck working till we die thanks to the policies in place, inflation and exploitation of labour
But the point is mainly not that they are banned forever from investing it‚Äôs just when they are able to directly control the policy creation that affects these things that they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to hold them. Look I‚Äôm not naive enough to think anything like this will ever happen or be put in place I‚Äôm just pissed off at the upper class always getting there way and never being reprimanded for crimes they commit like insider trading etc
It is quite possible that I do
Ok‚Ä¶? So why are you pretty certain? I presume something has led you to that level of certainty and I‚Äôd like to understand your reasoning.
There's an argument to be made that she isn't actually doing anything to tax rich people, but she's also _one_ congresswoman, and her more progressive wing of the party is actively suppressed by the rest of the old guard.
There are two sides of the coin, there are those praising her regardless,  and those shitting on her regardless,  it's not surprising the former would outnumber the latter given the demographics of the site. My point was less about assets that politicians should hold, and more about people blindly hating or loving a message because of it's source, rather than it's content. It's always been an issue, but it's now ridiculous.
I meant 2 republican led senate intelligence investigations said as much, maybe you need to read more than memes?

I've been following US senators stocks picks for the last 10 months in comparison to US laws and bills being passed at the same time they bought thier stocks... Dictionary definition of Insider trading.

I don‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs a liar either, I‚Äôm just clarifying that you don‚Äôt need to let the IRS know when you buy.
Huh? That‚Äôs talking about *interest*. If you have a staked coin and you receive *interest*, you have to report that interest because it‚Äôs something you received, not something you bought.

You have to report assets you *receive*, *give*, and *sell*but you do not have to report assets you *buy*.
That doesn't necessarily reveal that you've held any. You can accept and then spend a stable coin with 0 capital gains.
I‚Äôm not implying anything, I‚Äôm just clarifying that you don‚Äôt have to report buys to the IRS after someone seemed to suggest you have to to report *everything* you do with crypto to the IRS.
[deleted]
Absolutely nothing in form 1040 states that you have to report assets that you *bought* in a given tax year.
you're not entitled to anything.

and Obama's IRS was found by a federal judge to be targeting his political opposition, namely the Tea Party. this is an actual fact that you indoctrinated marxists are willfully ignorant about.
You sure about that? [Here's his taxes. ](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html)
That is not true. You are not required to report the purchase of cryptocurrency on your tax return if that's all you did.

[https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions)

**Q5**.  The 2020 Form 1040 asks whether at any time during 2020, I received, sold, sent, exchanged, or otherwise acquired any financial interest in any virtual currency. During 2020, I purchased virtual currency with real currency and had no other virtual currency transactions during the year. Must I answer yes to the Form 1040 question? (3/2/2021)  
   
**A5.  No.** **If your only transactions involving virtual currency during 2020 were purchases of virtual currency with real currency, you are not required to answer yes to the Form 1040 question.**
I think shes clean also but my point is that a politician saying they dont own crypto specifically is just useless as even if they dont even buy it they can have a wallet where they get sent donations, etc. Just not something that can be proven.
How are you all so defensive when i'm talking about a technology that can't be really tracked easily? I'm not even talking about her or accusing her holy shit, the fanaticism is crazy

No, I live in a democracy where representatives are hand picked by those with a lot of money and placed on a ballot for me to select the one I think sucks the least. The system is built around money. That's not conspiracy theory, that is fact.

If the only dirt you can find on Bernie is from a 40 year old essay with no context then yes I think he‚Äôs pretty decent compared to your average blatantly corrupt politician
Agree with the blind trust piece, would never happen though. 

Agree incentives are counterproductive to fair governing, but impossible to expect them to disappear. Given that, I‚Äôd rather have some legislators share my interests. Maybe ‚Äúrule with ignorance‚Äù wasn‚Äôt best wording, but they would rule with incentives in some things and indifference toward others, which would be advantageous to the categories of assets they hold. At least that‚Äôs how I would guess it would play out.
Agree. Hate the conflict of interest, but like unlimited terms, they‚Äôll never vote against the benefit of themselves. 

I do think we‚Äôre mostly on the same page here.
It's also hilarious that she had staff hold her dress while they were masked and she wasn't. Can't have the plebs thinking they're equal.
She's fake and lies. Her ICE stunt is one such way. It also doesn't help that she refuses to debate anyone who disagrees with her. If you support her I'd be interested to know in what capacity.

She‚Äôs being a great example for ethics & integrity
I really don‚Äôt see the need for politicians to be good Investment role models. She‚Äôs likely not doing those things to stay as throughly unbiased as she can. Also as an aside, with the amount of people who hate her with such vitriol, it‚Äôs probably for the best that she parks in a private garage
Democrats
Well considering they responded to the statement

>The Democrats would lose that race.

I would think you could figure that out.
Well I don't know how old you are but I'm almost 50. Let me ask you a question then.... If I'm hoping for real deal, unfiltered, 1938 East Berlin style communism who is more likely to provide that?  I'm pretty sure it's the younger elements of the far left progressives. Not some old blue dog JFK Democrat.
While I'm sure she won't be running, probably, ever, why wouldn't you? I mean, you probably voted for Joe Biden?
> I would never vote for AOC to be president.

Why the fuck not?! There are very few people that have been more on point than she has since she entered the public eye.
Why?
yes instead we let a minority of individuals tell the rest of everyone what to do way too often, what a genius system we've devised.  Absolutely genius also how in certain elections (eg presidential), your vote counts way more or less simply depending on which plot of dirt you reside within
>Who really tries to make money on investing in gold?

You were going well, and then you went too far.

Dollars/pounds/pesos are a currency, same as Bitcoin.  If she eliminated Bitcoin, then logic dictates she should eliminate all currencies for the same reasons.

The fact that Bitcoin is a digital currency is immaterial.  It's literally no different than the dollars in her bank account.

I don't think that'll ever happen. Truly libertarian countries don't exist for a reason - they don't work.
> So she hasn‚Äôt avoided lacking bias when it comes to handling politics about crypto by not holding bitcoin.

It certainly helps. If we could somehow disconnect politicians from fiat too, I think it would be good.
you already started it. tempting to hit and run awaaaaay
No you can‚Äôt be a communist democracy just like you can‚Äôt be a facist democracy both are authoritarian
Alt-right because I don't support AOC? I think the crypto game might be a little above your intelligence level, you should maybe step away.
I have crypto.  Even so, I tell some people it may not be for them because no matter how bullish I am on it, crypto is one of the higher risk investments the average person can make.  

Now, it would be wise for me to just tell them to invest everything they can in it because the more adoption, the better it is for the market.  However, I know it might not be the right move for everyone at this time.

It's not so much the bias that is bad, it's AOC's implication that she couldn't control herself to do what is right for her constituents if she has a bias that would steer her the other way personally.
Because leftist taught me that we shouldn‚Äôt assume gender.
No pebbles.
And when a coin you've invested in moons and you go to cash out and realize you're in a tax the rich tax bracket-- your song will change. Unless you're in crypto to stay in the middle class-- which I'd advise to spare yourself the agony and just work whatever job, invest in your 401k, drink some beer and watch football.
I probably shouldn‚Äôt have commented because it really wasn‚Äôt a big deal or something I really cared about. Just wondered why someone would have a problem with her buying a Bitcoin. She should b able to buy whatever she wants I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a conflict of interest or anything
I mean, sure, government action seems to have short term effects on crypto markets, but long term, their true value will determine their actual value if that makes sense

What do you consider rich?  I went through the first crash where I started to lose 1/2 of my initial investment. Market came back up and I took my initial investment and then some out.  I still hodl and add $ every month but not close to what I consider rich, meaning I still need to work. However, I have also used Bitcoin as currency. From what I can tell, very few places accept different types of currency as payment. I would live to use Eth or Loop but can‚Äôt.
I was there longer than 7 years ago and got strong armed to get out by the misses. Basically got nothing out of it and my kids won't be able to afford college. Feels bad man.
It's a mistake to link any ideology or philosophical tendency to a piece of technology. Satoshi tried with that news article snippet, but ultimately, the very thing that made Bitcoin interesting is what made his intentions practically irrelevant. Bitcoin is now controlled by monoliths, and has reproduced the patterns of wealth inequity found throughout modern civilization.

Anything that bestows power and influence will eventually be co-opted by the powerful and influential. It's unfortunately naive to cling to the ideals that some cryptocurrency advocates propose. It's better to view crypto as more akin to a weapon, which any individual or group can pick up and use for their own ends.
The people who really cared about bitcoin and the idea of using it as a currency all long left the boat, around 2017. Lots of these early adopters are now in XMR where technology is constantly improved and using it as a currency is still the main goal.
Nope, dont care about the libertarian dream Bitcoin was built on. I just look for good tech that services will buy into which will make their price go up. I look at NFT marketplaces and ETH alternatives that might solve gas prices. I view crypto as a product, a stock, a business/company- not as a currency.
Maybe because 90% of people can't understand it or how to define the market/stocks let alone crypto and just as many less can define general philosophical or economic terms.

Edit typo
98% of people dont care about any kind of philosophy at all.

There's more to life than money and bitches-snoop doggy dog

7 years ago there was a lot of buzz about bitcoin online. Much less than today, but it was being promoted as a life changing investment. I messed up hard in 2012 when I failed to buy some after my bank gave me trouble.
Everyone in IRC was mining bitcoin because it was a weird new thing to do.  Had nothing to do with philosophy.
7 years ago there was a halvening and it was noticeable news. I was going to invest but didn't know how to get my money on board. BTC went from 300 to 600, so I thought well I missed the boat, I'm definitely not buying now. So my 10k went to student loans instead of buying bitcoin.
I jumped in in 2017 before I read the white paper.  But I knew about btc pretty early. From being on Reddit when it was pretty new (decade or so ago). But that was the problem. It took a while for me to see it as anything but the currency of choice on the SR. And the tongue in cheek btc sub logo (bad ms paint wizard logo ‚Äúmagic internet money‚Äù) didn‚Äôt help me view it as anything other then a joke. After the crash I drilled down, read deeper. Bob Loukas‚Äô 4 Year Cycle vid was what made me decide it was something more then magic internet money.
What's dca?
It's pretty stable at $4-5 for the past 3 years üòë

The time will come. When Bitcoin is quiet and settles down, that‚Äôs when the magic happens. The best time to invest and mine coins. 
On the flip side - as you know There are too many shills and influencers pushing things simply for financial gain, which is terrible for new investors because they have no idea what rug pulls are. Those people never last inside industries. Just trend followers
Well good thing BTC isn't ""our"" currency then because government issued currencies still exist. BTC is a commodity.
How is it any more special than any other cryptocurrency? 
 
How is it more real than currency? How does the algorithm ‚Äúpreserve‚Äù work value?  Seems like its all over the place.
All good, just saw the notification and you made a good point
>I mean does it need to be stable to be a currency?

Yes. It can't be both a speculative, volatile asset and a currency.

If you buy 10 Things to make 10 other Th√¶ngs and now you can't sell those 10 Th√¶ngs for what you expected because Elon Musk tweeted, you're going to use a different currency.

Almost every vendor that 'accepts it' will use a third party to make it USD to the vendor. All you've gained with the currency is a little bit of secrecy - about as much as you get with cash. And bitcoin is not even the best at that. So it's literally just buying because other people are buying imo.
El Salvador is one country. A country that also still has the US dollar as its legal tender.
Nobody knows who took the short positions, but whoever knew it was coming decided to capitalize on it.  It may have been Bin Laden himself with the short position.

I find it very hard to believe that you‚Äôd have to explain it. It might be an idiom, but it is just one step away from literally explaining its meaning.
Agreed on the ‚Äúit‚Äôs still very new‚Äù point. But that doesn‚Äôt change that there is no conflict of interest with lawmakers owning some of it. They can‚Äôt hurt or help it other than raising or lowering how it‚Äôs taxed, and they already can do that with other things they own, like land, or money.

US lawmakers would stand a better chance at regulating the Yen or real estate in Switzerland than Bitcoin. Yet it‚Äôs ok for them to own those other things. What makes Bitcoin, the official currency of El Salvador, so special that it would be unethical for US lawmakers to own it?

Like I‚Äôm really trying to think of an example of an actual conflict of interest. What kind of a decision could a law or policy maker in the US make regarding Bitcoin? I‚Äôm failing to come up with something solid.
We could start by electing competent Congress members that have the best interests of the people in mind. Actual representatives that are in it for more than collecting lobbying $ would actually attempt to educate themselves instead of feeling threatened by something they don't understand.
Well, we‚Äôre *supposed* to go about that by voting out the decrepit dinosaurs that are completely out of touch with today‚Äôs society and the modern conditions of the working class.

But when half the country doesn‚Äôt vote and millions more are too lazy to cast an *informed* vote and participate in primary elections, the functions in place stop working‚Ä¶
If your politicians need to enrich themselves via their legislation then they're not politicians, they're grifters.

Wanting a healthy economy should be more than enough incentive for a candidate that's worth voting for.

For many politcians terms, 4 years, which is a long time to not invest and grow money. I would be pissed if I did public service in my town and I couldn't have a 401k or investment package grow. That's a lot of compounded interest I'm missing out on. It just needs to be highly regulated and scrutinized. It could be done pretty easily, but it will never happen.

I mean it's worked out extremely well for the only people in this country that matter. The corporate world.
Yes and this will keep going without any doubt for sure.
Smart contracts really do have the ability to make this kind of difference. CityDAO is exploring this with city-scale government. One thing about decentralization that makes me sad sometimes is that its best feature is getting rid of the need for trust. In my opinion, trust is immensely valuable, but we 100% don't have reason to trust those currently in power. Greed can so easily take control of people, and even coming from a fairly moderate person, the US government is totally corrupted by corporate money and politicians seeking personal financial gain. We will see what the future holds.
>There should be some smart contract in place that gets politicians to hold accountable for the shit they promise when running for office.

The second amendment, my friend.
This must have changed in the recent past because I remember when they shit on at&t in the 80s/90s for that
2022 I think we'll see a lot of regulation, starting with stablecoins.
Our votes the following election are supposed to be the smart contract, but our electoral system is fucked in at least five very substantial ways which makes that idea a joke.

The positive side of lobbying is that it allows industry experts to inform legislators about topics that they likely don't expertise in so they can make informed decisions while voting. The bad side is what we all know where corporations utilize lobbyist groups to pay legislators to support their causes. Again, the answer is to remove corporate money from politics. Lobbying has a place in our government if we can remove the corruption. There are lobbying groups that work for positive change, you just don't hear about it.

It's a different category than investing in stocks in the typical sense. People wouldn't use it as a retirement tool if not. I would not consider a 401k in the same league as trading stocks.
No it is.  Smart people will try and get their money to work for them but there is nothing making them do it.
I think the electoral college is a good system and not created for nefarious means like the Council of Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission are. The electoral college was created to prevent tyranny of the majority it's outlined by James Madison in The Federalist Paper #10. I think the fundamental basis of our political system is founded in good, not evil, and it is being infiltrated by those groups to make it evil. A lot of it started in World War 1 which was a war that wasn't needed but was supposedly created by the Rockefellers/banking cartels in order to make money off the loans they gave out. 
          
7 of the last 13 presidents have been members of the CFR and several of the last 9 have been members of the trilateral commission which is financed by The Rockefellers and Rothschilds because they want a 1 world government
What about selling the ""family business"" and buying real estate in the form of income generating multi family homes, now is it a conflict of interest?
So, USD is the only centralized currency?
It‚Äôs a monetary system it‚Äôs not a stock and yes prices continually fluctuate while a hammer remains a hammer. Fiat systems constantly change relating to one another. The only difference is the maturity of fiat versus a decentralized commodity.

And no - digital currency end-game is not to be used as a medium between different currencies.

Money is power and who holds it dictates the future. It matters a great deal and these crooks will continue forcing this socialized fiat down our throats. It‚Äôs exactly why BTC exists and it‚Äôs exactly why they give a crap about it right now - it challenges what they‚Äôve done to the usd since freaking Nixon.

I don't know where you get this idea that progressives are anti-crypto from.

I think the slightly mental libertarian foghorn you get on here is very much from a minority.  There's nothing really about Bitcoin or crypto in general that a progressive could, would or should object to.
The progressives are ok with Crypto, it's the old Democrats like Elizabeth Warren, Janet Yellen types who are against it.

Owning shares is just one way to be invested in something. I could buy pebbles for a million usd and just dump them on my lawn. I am now invested in pebbles. When it comes to legislation regarding keeping a shitload of pebbles on the lawn and I am a politician, there is a conflict of interest here. And that all without ever owning shares of any pebble company. Silly example but you get the idea.

If you got your money on a bank, you are just as much invested in that bank, no matter if you own shares or not.
invest - to put money, effort, time, etc. into something to make a profit **or get an advantage**

[source](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/invest)

Yes, historically direct profit through interest played a larger role than today where interest is basically 0%. Today people put their money in bank accounts for different advantages: It's secure compared to having your life savings under your mattress, allows easy payment, not only in physical stores, but online, nation wide and even internationally. Not direct financial profit, but advantages never the less.

Also don't really understand why those $0.10 wouldn't count? Minimal risk investments bring minimal returns, that's just the way it is. People could invest in stocks instead for example, way higher risk, but potentially way higher returns. Most people however do prefer the low risk low reward investment of putting it on the bank for a decent percentage of the value they own.

US has a much bigger impact on other countries than those. I'm talking from a British perspective so we are also impacted more than most countries. Its just a fact that US and Chinese politics often impact the world due to their financial and military power. For that reason you often see people from other countries criticising certain policies/politicians. 

I'm also aware the UK has a disproportionate effect on other countries relative to its size.

Green new deal is a joke. She doesn't understand basic taxation as she screwed new York workers out of thousands of much needed jobs. She's a pandering moron who took a cringe photo at the border that was clearly staged. She believes in abolishing immigration control, as she hasn't gone back to the border once finding out Obama and Biden built those cages.. not the orange man. She lied about the her whereabouts during the capitol riots. She's isn't even respected by her own party and she fucking cries during sessions of congress...a lot. 
 I could go on and on but your libtard brain would explode. Wow. People actually fall for her bullshit. Just wow. The CNN is crushing y'all into complete ignorance.

Bernie‚Äôs way isnt good enough anymore. Theres a reason he ran for president. To push for the needed drastic changes. Due to the nature of climate change, little progress here and there will not be enough  not even close.

Drastic change is needed and having someone actually say these things out loud might push more people to think about whats going on and maybe support more candidates that will make aoc and the progressives agenda work
From what I'v seen, and I haven't seen all, she is very reasonable. Which is very much reinforced by the fact that most of the time when I see Americans blasting her it's because they're raving lunatics blasting moderate suggestions of improvement.
You‚Äôre saying she denied a specific instance of crime happening?

I can‚Äôt find any source where she essentially says ‚Äúthis specific crime that was caught on camera didn‚Äôt happen‚Äù

Sounds like you deep throated some conservative propaganda and are now patting yourself on the back for it - pretending you‚Äôre the reasonable one

All I‚Äôm finding is her saying that specific instances of crime don‚Äôt necessarily indicate a larger trend and conservatives are trying to spin that into ‚Äúshe denied that there is crime but we see crime on camera!?! She‚Äôs crazy!?!‚Äù
That's an assumption on your part though. I mostly base my opinions on watching American politicians speak for themselves.

Somehow Americans are always so eager to make excuses for their politicians when pretty much the entire world listens to them with open mouths thinking ""those people are fucking batshit"".
No doubt, but they presented it as an opinion where this guy was all ‚Äúsorry to burst your bubble but you‚Äôre wrong‚Äù haha
You criticize the US by saying there's just blue vs red then thats exactly how you rag on AOC? Calling her a far left communist? Lmfao
The US has a for-profit prison system that is closer to slavery than the rehabilitation of convicts. It has a justice system that is incredibly skewed, biased and often abused to funnel minorities into that for-profit prison system.

From what I gather, the argument you're trying to bring up involves taking one incident completely out of context to protest making changes to the most fucked up justice and prison system anywhere in the West.

And then proceeding to use that as an argument against a politician trying to make positive change.
That's a nice theory but her previous work history is irrelevant. I don't pay that much attention but when I hear her, she's intelligent, well spoken, with a good set of political priorities.

She just has the misfortune of working in the lunatic asylum of US politics where those things tend to make one a target. A place where anything reasonable is quite frequently put away as 'theater' because reasonable has become synonymous with unrealistic.
If you give an industry a day to change it will take them a week even if they can change in 2 days‚Ä¶ so yeah it‚Äôs good she‚Äôs got an aggressive stance on tackling it
You are ignorant if you think the left or right economic theory is aligned with authoritarianism. You can be a anarchistic or authoritarian believing in right or left hand economic theories. Stop being brainwashed.

Anyone who says leftist is by definition a moron
She would be like a centrist in netherlands or denmark, you know, those authoritarian hellscapes with the happiest citizens in the world. 

You‚Äôre repeating propaganda. Congrats you fell for it.
so why should AOC write a healthcare bill when Senator Sanders and Rep Jayapal already have fully fleshed out proposals? why would she do the same for other issues that other senators and reps have already written bills for? it would be redundant and not a good use of time for a candidate who has a 2-year term and needs to specifically tend to the needs of people in her district. if you find me an issue, i will find you the progressive legislation that hasn‚Äôt even been brought to a vote by the neolib speaker pelosi

the problem isn‚Äôt that there isn‚Äôt existing legislation, the problem is that conservatives and the neoliberals who stymie progress at every level 

simply amplifying the message as loud as she has with the tag socialist proudly on her back is something not seen in this country for 75 years 

she‚Äôs doing a lot of amazing things compared to the rest of the scum that are selling stocks before the pandemic, increasing the war budget by trillions, and bending over for every corporate interest out there
citizens electing a representative is not a special interest group lmao 

a broad legislative agenda (which is what the Green New Deal, not a single bill) is not a special interest

>I dont buy that for a second.   I know people who have taken one look at her and hated her immediately, and I know it happens on large scale in this country.

No you don't.
That is probably true of the subreddit specifically, but the conspiracy scene has been subverted by groups seeking to empower and manipulate conservative voters.

It has been like this since wayyy back on infowars, they started to really double down and focus on the gun rights angle. 

""They're gonna take away your guns and put you in FEMA camps!""
They used to go hard on Trump and conservative politicians, now they're given free passes whilst any democrats are basically the devil. Literally.
Check r/conspiracynopol
Yes! Exactly this! It can be explained easily when viewed in the context of Russian intelligence seeking to destabilise the west, which has been proven to be the source of most conspiracy-type media
Yet more dismissing and non thinking in place of self reflection. Sadly this is all too common.
Politicians tell you what you want to hear. I have my own biases but am well aware of them. 

For instance, ""these are core values of US conservatives anyway..."" is a bias. Are you a mind reader? You make assumptions about people based on preconceived notions. Pretty much the definition of biases.

I don't take what politicians say at face value. They care about money and power. The rest is pandering.

Things aren't all or nothing. When people believe it to be all or nothing, I know I'm talking to their beliefs, which are always biased, and not the genuine person. A political zombie.

I do think for myself. People praising AOC for saying something good is biased because how do they feel when right leaning politicians call for unity? Right, they don't believe it because of their biases and they are able to see that politicians lie because they already have their mind made up about the other tribe. They have rose colored lenses on when looking at AOC.

When will you political zombies learn the politicians you like don't give two shits about you and that words are cheap?

That whole second paragraph you wrote is just a narrative. A story you tell about me. It is not accurate about me and the majority of conservative individuals. How the hell would you even know that? You don't. You're just lumping me in with others. It's a big reason I was pushed more to the right. People on the left are inclusive until they aren't. Tell them this and they double down saying ""we shouldn't have to be inclusive about hate"", oblivious to the fact that many people consider the way the left acts to be hateful. Yes, these are my biases. This is what I have observed nonstop for ~8 years. 

When I tell the left this, trying to get them to open their eyes to the fact there's a ton of gray area in the world, that it isn't black and white, and that their behavior is causing more to move right...what do they say?

They double down again. ""It's not that what we do is wrong...you've just ALWAYS been a bad person""

Imagine the narcissism behind being so certain of what's right and wrong that you literally are okay with deeming 10s of millions of people, basically half the country, as evil, racist, women haters...yet for some reason everyone wants to come to the US.

I could go on and on. Anyway, politics ruins crypto
Obviously there would be details but the overall idea would be to pay them a generous salary (like the one they already get), with room/board/airline credits, and disallow any income from other sources for their term in office.
First off don't let them pick their own salary.  It's batshit crazy they get to vote on their own raises.
You have a very pessimistic point of view. The vast majority of people can retire comfortably at under 70 provided you aren‚Äôt stupid with your money. Look up early retirement calculator and you can see even with a mediocre 10% savings rate you can retire in 50 years (if you start at 20, then at 70 you can retire.)
You are thinking Myanmar üá≤üá≤ or formally Burma üá≤üá≤.
So you have presumptions. That‚Äôs what makes it a weird question. You‚Äôve already made up your mind. What I would point out is that she‚Äôs open. There‚Äôs nothing hidden about her.
I mean, campaign contributions are public record.  She takes no corporate or PAC money.
>There's an argument to be made that she isn't actually doing anything to tax rich people.

Only from people who are completely ignorant. It took me 10 seconds to find her legislative sponsorships which include the ""
Stop Wall Street Looting Act"".

>The Stop Wall Street Looting Act would fundamentally reform private equity by closing the legal, tax, and regulatory loopholes that allow private equity firms to capture all the rewards of their investments while insulating themselves from risk.

https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5648/all-actions?s=1&r=8&overview=closed#tabs

And the ""tax on Wall Street speculation"" act here -

You can see all of her legislative co-sponsorships here -

https://www.congress.gov/member/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/O000172

You guys can go through her history and find all of the legislation that she has been a part of many of which includes tax reform. You can agree or disagree with her legislative agenda but denying the fact that she is engaging in this activity is ludicrous.

If you buy crypto assets with crypto assets (not fiat), you have to report.
Interest on that question on 1040 means possessory interest, not financial interest.   Check on the 1040 instruction sheet pages 16 and 17.  You have to report ANY transaction.
financial interest is not interest like from a bank account or staked coin, it means that you have an amount of investment into a thing such to the point where you are 'invested' in its success.  As in, if someone had their life savings in bitcoin they would not receive interest buy they would have an interest in bitcoins value not decreasing.
Yes, no capital gains on such a transaction, but if you accept a stable coin (or any coin for that matter) that is taxable as ordinary income.
Unlike other politicians she doesn't have a history of blatant and obvious lies.

She also said that she doesn't hold any stock. You still have to declare stocks - even if you don't sell them.

Oh. I agree.   

I still prefer her type of stance, trying to be as open as possible. Even if it turns out she does have things, the fact she shows her taxes and other things makes it at worst harder to cheat, and at bests pushes other politicians to go clean.
I‚Äôm just drawing logical conclusions lol.

If you‚Äôre talking about tracing the coins back to a person, then maybe you should be more clear in your earlier comments, because one way to prove it is through tax returns lol. 

Also unless you use privacy focused coins like XMR, your coins can get traced back to you lol. It can be difficult to do so, but it is *not* impossible

No not all politicians are the same. There are good ones and bad ones. If you don't like one, either vote for someone else or run for office yourself. If you hate democracy, go live somewhere with a dictator.
That's true. Very true in the US. However there are at least a handful of politicians that are advocating against dirty money in politics. AOC is one of them, Bernie is another one. So even though majority of politicians accept money from special interest groups, there are some on our side. Instead of saying all politicians are garbage, we can vote more of AOC types in congress and push for legislations that limits corporations involvement in politics.
That entire qoute! To say ALL elected representatives are bad or working against you and this is all part of a conspiracy against every day people.

>Given that, I‚Äôd rather have some legislators share my interests

So would I, but my legislators don't just represent me, they represent everyone in my district and state, which is why they shouldn't hold any *specific* interests, only general ones.
I respect her, even if I don‚Äôt agree with everything she proposes. She voices her opinion. Stands for something. USA politics has frankly been an embarrassment over the past few years - literally had elected officials supporting an attack on the capitol, and a complete refusal to hold them accountable afterwards. The whole thing needs a massive shakeup.
I don‚Äôt think any politician is a saint - but all I ever see targeted towards her is childish name calling.
See - dumbass, clown. Do you not have anything intelligent to say about her other than name calling?
It's called criticism. If you're boldly making a public statement about taxing people, you shouldn't rely entirely on the services of someone who has outstanding tax warrants.
No, she is a piece of shit. Those who support her are either idiots or low information voters.

It's unethical to invest in index funds? It's unethical to try to build wealth with the hope of retiring someday?

Yes. It is the United States. Each state chooses who they want to represent them.
300 000 people voted for Joe manchin.
It may be a bit exaggerated, but I think it's somewhat true. I am not talking about trading but about long term investing. I think the primary function is definitely preserving value and not big gains.
The one thing I like about her is that she proved that citizens that work a normal job, that stand up and gather supporters, can manage to get involved in politics. 

Don't care about her politics, I'm not even an American, but I think that's the big thing about her, that no one can deny is good for American politics. 

People seeing a chance to be heard and get involved.

> She also said unemployment is low because people are working two jobs

Yeah, it's called underemployment and it's a real thing economists look at. 

It's included as part of the U-6 unemployment rate.

Someone who wants but is unable to find a full time job and is stuck working crappy part time jobs to make ends meet isn't counted as part of the standard U-3 unemployment rate.

lol, we voted many in who were actors or reality TV stars. That being said I think you would have a hard time not agreeing that this issue from AOC is a worthy one.
Okay, are you saying that she, as a member of the financial services committee of the US House, has a financial conflict of interest in owning a Pound, Peso, or other foreign currency?  That by virtue of being a lawmaker you are saying they should literally not own anything, even her own nations currency?  Interesting...  Strange that you are so extreme. I would submit that putting reasonable limits it place is better than throwing up hands and deciding everything is futile.
[deleted]
I'm just stating facts. She is clearly attractive. It has nothing to do with her ability to govern, but it has a lot to do with low self esteem males disliking her. Once again, the stupidest comment responses I get are ALWAYS from people in r/conspiracy. Never fails.
I‚Äôm not saying that markets don‚Äôt move bc of fiscal policy, I‚Äôm saying they don‚Äôt induce as massive % swings as crypto
I see, you subscribe to the ""liberal media"" type of mindset, which is laughable. NYT is a deeply neolib outlet. Just because they don't hate gays and abortions, you think that they're on the left lol
We know she hasn't traded and she is saying she is not holding any. Evidence is on her side if you are making good faith argument. You claiming she is a secret hodler diamond hands?
I disagree but don‚Äôt care to debate it here.
But it doesn‚Äôt help is my point because she‚Äôs just got influence the other way.
Huh I guess you're right. The workers cant own the means of production without also having 1 guy owning everything. People in the commune taking decisions together in a classless society sound absolutely preposterous now that I think about it.
edit: Literally a living example and you downvote.  You only see what you want to believe.  Lmfao.

-----

This is completely incorrect.  

If you have 100 people in a village of 10 families, and each family has a representative who votes on decisions, that is a communist democracy.  

Voluntary communist societies exist in our world already - in particular, in the Kibbutzim in Israel, where people choose to be part of the Kibbutz. The exact model varies from one Kibbutz to the next, with some being more like socialism, and others having moved into a more capitalist arrangement, but some have retained their communist style. Some are collapsing, others are modernising, and some are simply continuing on in a stable manner.

https://www.touristisrael.com/what-is-a-kibbutz/6053/#:~:text=A%20kibbutz%20is%20a%20type,A%20collective%20community%2C%20traditionally%20agrarian.&text=Today%2C%20there%20are%20over%20270,and%20many%20are%20now%20private.

>Kibbutzim were initially almost universally agricultural settlements. Not economically motivated, the residents of the communes shared everything and worked as members of a collective. In the early days, times were tough, everything was shared and life was hard. The members all had different jobs in the community, either in agriculture and elsewhere. Some were in the kitchen, the kindergarten or in the children‚Äôs house. Members lived in modest accommodation, and children lived in ‚Äòchildren‚Äôs houses‚Äô along with their peers, seeing their parents only for a few hours each day. All meals were eaten in the dining hall and the sense of community was great.
You are 100% a Trump supporter. She didn‚Äôt speak negative about Crypto or Stocks. She said the right thing that politicians shouldn‚Äôt hold stock or cc because of interest conflicts, and she is absolute right. Lobbyist politicians destroyed our world and environment.
There‚Äôs no cure for being a Qunt.
I am in those brackets actually, but like I said those levels of wealth are not at all comparable to the ultra wealthy.  We're all lower class to them.  Not everyone becomes evil when they gain money.  I'm advising things that are common sense regardless of what I make
>First - the original post surrounds AOC supposedly reducing bias for not holding any crypto. BTC is not regulated like stocks and doesn‚Äôt deal with the traditional idea of insider trading due to limitations...

Crypto isn't regulated, *yet*. However, everybody knows that this question is being actively being discussed in Washington, as it has been around the globe. Any legislation regarding crypto would directly influence its price one way or another, and furthermore could even affect one crypto more than the other. The risks of congress people holding cryptos or even specific cryptos while in power are practically identical to those involved in similar trading. There isn't quite as many different avenues to take advantage of this fact as there are with traditional trading, but the risk is still there and rather great.

>Second ... To be logically consistent, she should not hold any USD holdings, because she has more influence over USD price as a legislator than she does over BTC

She probably agree with you there, for the most part she's pretty much against people taking advantage of their position of legislative power to increase their wealth. She's pretty outspoken about that. 

But nevertheless, the fact remains that the USD is the only universally accepted currency in America. She really doesn't have a choice when it comes to the daily operation of her life. I get the desire to compare cryptocurrencies to universally accepted fiat currencies in any given country, and I understand that it's possible to switch to a crypto in the future, but as of right now it's simply not practical for the vast majority of Americans. And if it is ever to be fully implemented, which crypto? That's a question that is likely going to end up as part of some legislation, and then you have that conflict of interest once again.

>Third, what makes you think that AOC understands the original use case of BTC? It‚Äôs a side topic and mostly irrelevant, but I found this comment funny because AOC doesn‚Äôt even understand high school economi

This is just a silly claim, honestly. She graduated college with the bachelor's degree in economics. She's clearly one of the more internet savvy people in all of Congress, and unlike the multitude of old politicians who have made an ass of themselves trying to talk about crypto, she's never really misstepped. I can understand how one's political view can make one dismissive of the opposite aisles education or intellect, but she's a poor target for this idea.

>Fourth - assuming she would legislate legal tender laws is probably your best argument, but there is a flaw with it that actually proves my point. By not legislating the existing legal tender laws on the books

She does legislate the existing legal tender. That's like half of her political existence. Not sure what you mean by this..

>There aren‚Äôt any legal tender laws when it comes to cryptocurrency, and a free market in money works just fine. 

BTC specifically has been crazy volatile over the past two years. I literally wouldn't have been able to pay my bills some months if the amount of money I had in my bank dropped by 40% over a week. C'mon man.

>BTC has always remained number 1,

So has the USD, really. BTC really doesn't have that kind of longevity yet. And I thought we were anti-legacy.

>I can cite historical example after historical example, if you wish, of cases where government decree over the ‚Äúlegitimacy‚Äù of money was completely irrelevant.

And yet, nearly every single good and service that trades hands in the United States is done via USD. BTC, meanwhile, is just being used to primarily to store or inflate wealth *currently.* Yes, plenty of people *are* using it for actual trades as well, using it as a currency as originally intended, but you and I both know that that makes up for an incredibly tiny percentage of the market cap. And yes, I fully understand that this is not what was intended, and it's not what many of us would like, but that is the current reality. Perhaps it will change, I hope it will.

>Government decree can play a role, but at the end of the day, if the average actor in the economy thinks that USD is worthless, it doesn‚Äôt mean a lick if the government decreed USD (or any other money or category/type of money) to be ‚Äúlegitimate.‚Äù

Same goes for cryptos, but also no, any major government diligentizing or legitimizing currency as widely spread is going to cause problems. Perhaps that action wouldn't fully make or break its target, but there's an extremely good chance it's going to make some serious, serious waves. This can be taken advantage of by legislators in power.

That‚Äôs funny, at that same time when the price was 300-700, I actually took out $10k extra student loans to buy Bitcoin
Look up dollar cost averaging, or the constant dollar plan.   You basically drop a regular amount into your crypto account each week, month, whatever you can. You don‚Äôt look at the price of your crypto to time your purchase at a low peak, you just keep dropping amounts.  The idea is that time in the market is better than timing the market.
That's great. But the people who want Bitcoin as a currency are going to be very disappointed that it's never going to happen
It is more special because of how it was launched and fairly distributed. We all had an equal chance in 2009 to get as much as we can, there was no special sale or initial coin offering. It was an immaculate conception. The ""work"" aka ""mining is preserved through through protocol of guaranteeing that 1 Bitcoin will still be worth 1 Bitcoin in 100 years. What makes USD special? They just printed 3 trillion out of NOTHING last year. We will continue to pay for that NOTHING through inflation and theft through higher taxes caused by that inflation. Of the can just print 3T, why do I have to pay taxes, obviously they can just print more when they need it, they don't need me.
Moreso than secrecy Bitcoin can‚Äôt be confiscated if you have it in a cold wallet and retain your seed phrase. Physically impossible for anyone to touch it if you keep that secret. It has its benefits outside of simple investment but certainly shouldn‚Äôt be relied on as stable. It clearly differs enough from other speculative assets in that it‚Äôs still used as a medium of exchange, if it was grouped with them it‚Äôs a lot more likely we‚Äôd see typical speculative assets used in this way too, no?

Nancy Pelosi and politicians in general  owning stocks is comical quite frankly, compared to the other unbelievable corruption we have that‚Äôs pretty low on the totem poll of concerns I have.
For a tat.
Water the plants with Brawndo.
I get what legal tender is, my point is that the standard you're expecting is too high. Politicians hold things of value, and the influence the value of everything! That shouldn't be a reason not to hold things of value. The fact that money is designated as legal tender is irrelevant to that logic.
Guess they expect her to pay for her rent and food in BTC lol
No, it means she's biased against other assets, including the companies that keep the economy running.

If people in government held only USD, you'd see much less inflation, for example.(assuming they self deal)

This ain't rocket science chief.
You're literally on a crypto subreddit.

How the fuck does holding only one asset not make you biased towards that asset. Inflation would directly hurt politicians if they only held USD.

Ofc not that's why he's *briefing* us on the **information**.
As I said in another comment, give them a 90-day delay from when they put their orders in. That essentially stops them from using privileged information as by the time the 90-day delay is up the info is probably public by then.
Now see heres the part that's really gonna blow your mind.

In the eyes of the government, they are completely separate people. When you get married there's paperwork for a reason. He's also not on her sweet as health insurance either because according to the government they aren't together.

What should blow your mind even further is that they aren't supposed to tell anyone about things that can and will influence stock prices. That includes your spouse, your boyfriend/girlfriend, but also your friends, family, interns, assistants, etc. The reason why people do this shit with their families; because it also personally gains them wealth. You tell your assistant, or your cleaner, or your friends, it doesn't personally gain you wealth. Even if she tells her boyfriend if they don't end up getting married it doesn't help her just like it wouldn't help her if she told any random joe blow. 

So no, there's really no difference between her boyfriend or any other random person.
Who suggested this? Are they in the comment section with us right now?
Yea, they do.

I need you to understand that left-wingers don't worship politicians like you do; we expect them to serve us.

>It's a different category than investing in stocks in the typical sense

No it's really not.

You can buy the exact same ETFs for a 401k that you can on any RobinHood account. 401k is just a tax advantaged investment vehicle. In fact, if you have a 401k brokerage window (40% of all accounts in the USA do) you can even buy individual stocks.

I would say owning the homes isn't a conflict, but renting them out for income would be. Unless you expect politicians to give up all of their possessions it doesn't really make sense to ban ownership of assets in the same way people want to ban ownership of securities.
I‚Äôm sorry, does AOC have regulatory control of every single currency as a whole? 

Are you being intentionally dense here.
You were the one treating fiat currency like a stock. You were talking about was how holding fiat would bias a politicians because they stand to gain monetarily from it or something. My point is even if you treat crypto like a stock investment, fiat currency doesn't work the same way and does appreciate in value like crypto does.

None of what you said contradicts that. Holding fiat currency wouldn't bias politicians towards or against crypto. What matters is their opinion on fiat currency in terms of the power it gives the government itself.
Yes
I only needed to watch 30 seconds to see the false narrative that is presented:

- she has as much money (probably less) than every other politician in the same position, yet she is one of the rarer politicians wanting to make changes for the less fortunate than her (i dont see any republicans stepping up). That is not hypocrisy (republicans get millions in shady donations but they criticise a 50k car...really?) 

- the gala was free for her, she didnt pay 30k, but i guess i dont expect right wingers to spread facts

My perspective hasn't changed. Hopefully yours will, though.

It's not libertarian, it's anti-tax. Texas is talked about as a Libertarian paradise here while they pass laws forcing underage girls to carry their rapist's baby to term.
Rather than the concept of crypto itself, energy usage could be an environmental/infrastructure concern for some of them, right?

The bigger conflict of interest though is AOC playing video games and mining throttling the GPU market. /s
Bitcoin ultimately aims to replace the dollar. If the government loses control of the money printer, they won‚Äôt be able to fund radical socialist agendas like universal basic income. Crypto encourages free markets and personal responsibility. It‚Äôs also about decentralization of power and stripping powers away from the nation states. Leftists want centralization of power in the federal government. They want government redistributing wealth and printing money for the poor. They want the federal government to play mommy and daddy and help the citizens as opposed to the citizens helping themselves.
Exactly.  It's the corporatists that are against crypto, not the progressives.
Wow a bachelor's in economics! HOLY CREDENTIALS.
Its funny Grimes gives that vapid Crypto/Gaming is the future  quote and this sub is on fire people lamenting her as dumb. Where as AOC is into gaming, thus she must be well read on crypto, also ""she like did really well in a HS science fair""; so smart.
When you buy the pebbles, you own them. When you put money in the bank, you don't own the bank. If anything the relationship between a bank and individual account holders is antagonistic. They certainly don't have the same interests.
I would argue the $0.10 does not apply because one does not receive the benefits of the bank‚Äôs profits or the detriment of its losses. Unlike owning stocks/shares of a bank or bank holding company, you are more a customer of the bank rather than a share or stockholder of the bank.

Just look at r/news and r/politics which are just echo chambers. Say anything bad about the left or right and you‚Äôll be downvoted into oblivion depending on which subreddit you are on.

But to answer your first question, it‚Äôs you. You‚Äôre the one brainwashed. May you live the rest of your days alone, in your delusion, for there is no getting through to you.
Yea, as I said, she gets more attention from the right that almost any other politician because she‚Äôs become one of her faces of the party. This comment chain is saying she gets more attention because of something else and I assumed there was a peculiar large misinformation campaign because of this. 

More simply, every politician who is put in the public spotlight as much as AOC seems to get a comparable amount of misleading articles. I‚Äôm asking if there‚Äôs actually any credence to the claim that she gets disproportionately more. I genuinely would be interested in reading about it.
The majority of the country already agrees with her even if they call her a commie or whatever, trump even ran on some of the progressive talking points. You‚Äôre right tho nothing is really gonna happen until we get a decent president but progress can still be made in the meantime freeing non violent drug offenders for example

Well good for you if that's the case, but I'm still doubtful.  Usually when people say that they really mean they saw a short 30s clip on a biased site like MSNBC or Fox News.  American politics is all about mischaracterizing your political opponents so you seem like the only reasonable person in the room.

Thing is, if you *haven't* heard some of the insane things AOC has said and think she's the reasonable one I'm very skeptical of your claim that you've looked into this very much.
Good point, they did a poor job phrasing it as their opinion.
But she is. Just listen to her for 5 seconds. And i have said as outsider i think on both sides there is a bunch of idiots. But because i don't agree with your blue opinion i fall automatically in red group to you.  


And i didn't say she is a community. I meant to say that she likes the concept of that ideology way to much. And she is far left
So you're being willfully ignorant because a hot chick says things you like, even if she's just a mouthpiece for a massive power-hungry entity. You sure sound intelligent
You are not exercising your mental faculties when you believe ""economics"" ultimately transforms to freedom. It's just as coercive to jail a woman who provides sexual services in exchange for money as jailing two men who share a bed together.

They take little gafffes and try to make it seem like she is ignorant. You note they say nothing WHATSOEVER about her message or the content- which is 100% dead on accurate- just the misspeak.

Their target Dunning-Krueger audience like yourself eat it up, being incapable of grasping the actual data being relayed by her. You have been programmed to hate her, and you do.
Oh boy a fact check that says in reality in was an empty road leading to a camp you got me I admit I was wrong. So why is she not down there crying now? You know they resumed doing the exact same thing right? 

That's what annoys me. It's the hypocrisy. It's ok now that they call the shots I guess??
Don't worry. Here in Canada it's pretty bad too. So bad actually that we had a recent national election and virtually nothing changed (not because people are happy but because there is a total lack of leadership here)

Very few of us can even save 10% with the rent rates and cost of living rises the public sector I work in has been on a 1% pay freeze for the last 10 years I‚Äôm pessimistic due to experience
Ah my apologies I believe you are right
My presumption is that someone (e.g. you) has arrived at a conclusion through some sort of logical path and not randomly. 

I‚Äôm not presuming anything about AOC, but since it seems you have some idea about her, I‚Äôd like to understand what you are thinking.

What is so weird about wanting to understand how someone thinks and how they reached their conclusions? 

If you give an opinion or share some insight then you should expect people to ask why!
That‚Äôs a good start.

Yes, because you‚Äôre selling an asset in that scenario. You have to report the asset you sold as well as the gain/loss you realized when you sold, but you do not have to report the asset you bought.
You have to report ANY transaction.  See 1040 instructions pages 16-17.
Do you have to report how much of the income is virtual currency, or just yes/no on virtual currency and then dollar amount for total income?
there's that leftist lack of accountability we've become accustomed to.

Someone being sane here. Thank you!
If we we're to follow law then like 90% of the sub never owned any crypto probably lol
I said its useless because if you dont want others to know , they won't ever know - which is true. It can be done through donations even in which case your IRS won't show anything. Me saying the statement can't be proven or disproven doesn't mean i'm some right-wing loon that accuses her of anything. Its just too easy to cheat using crypto.
No it seems you are emotional hence you saying trump is orange when it wasn‚Äôt necessary to bring him up to make your point.

I agree trump is orange and we know he doesn‚Äôt show tax returns.

What‚Äôs that have to do with other politicians?
I have a hard time believing AOC isn‚Äôt more of the same. For all we know, she advocates for what the people want because it will propel her political career, not because actual change can be made or because she cares. Maybe she does. I‚Äôll believe it when she actually does something about the real problems.

Personally I advocate for eating the rich and condemning the politicians. Not clinging to conspiracy theories, just know that the US is lost. Corporations already won the battle.
Buddy context is a very subjective thing especially since that was from a short story. Like I said if that‚Äôs all you can find when every other politician is openly getting paid off by the military and big pharma then you‚Äôre proving my point
Agree. I just don‚Äôt realistically see them giving up other interests, so I don‚Äôt want those interests to have an advantage over our interests

She‚Äôs overcorrecting, sure, but I‚Äôd rather that than under correcting or doing nothing to reduce bias
What an original thought
Oh I agree, Trump's rhetoric set this country back at least 50 years
The way I see it, anything she would try to do would be watered down to appease the rest of the party and then watered down again to appease 1-2 senate republicans so even the most left wing policy will look like a Biden campaign promise if it ever gets enacted
Did you consider the libertarian candidate? I couldn‚Äôt stomach voting for Biden who I disagreed with on a policy level and Trump I was just tired of him saying stupid stuff. So I ended up going third party.
She demonstrates on a weekly basis that she's the furthest thing from dumb, but nice try.
Tell me something she said that was dumb.
I agree with pretty much everything aoc believes in but she does not know how to get shit done

Im not saying any of that.  Im just taking her logic to its conclusion.  Singling out a currency as verboten, is not equal protection under the law.

Stocks? Totally different story.  But currency? It makes no sense to ban holding currency.  But to only ban one is akin to selective prosecution.  So ban all, or ban none.  Any other logic is faulty.

See where im going with this? Demand consistancy from your representatives.
meanwhile the people calling folks like AOC ""fools"" almost invariably think Trump is a genius üòÜ

I agree with you on a lot of what you've commented actually. And have appreciated the level headed conversation-- quite rare these days. But the particular politician in question is anything but common sense. If you're in those brackets I think you can agree that a socialist agenda is not in the best interest of our country.
What makes something the best decision financially? Is there not room for speculation with reguards to what the best financial route is? Also legislation has some control over where our taxes go, why shouldnt they get to control what their personal money? And bitcoin is a currency, not a stock, I belive this separates it from the private sector to a degree but correct me if im wrong.
You can get there.  Just be patient and DCA.
Hell yeah brother.
Yes crypto exchanges are SO much more trustworthy. 

I sware this community has reached a point where it‚Äôs indistinguishable from I‚Äôm 14 and this is cool. 

The banking system isn‚Äôt trust less at all. In fact it‚Äôs quite the opposite. Just because some rich investment bankers manipulate the market doesn‚Äôt mean the whole system is garbage.

Crypto markets  is a literal unregulated Ponzi scheme of nothing. If the banking system is trust less‚Ä¶ the big money people manipulating crypto is 10,000x more blatant and lawless and hidden. 

This magic fantasy of ‚Äúdefi‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even make sense in theory. It‚Äôs just a vague emotion, with no actual basis or meaning.

Most people, for sure. What makes this sting is that I had put all my information in, clicked ""purchase"", and my bank blocked the transaction. It wasn't a lot, but it would be worth a fortune today. And instead of fixing the issue, I got distracted and busy and forgot about it.

Truthfully though, I probably would've exited with maybe a 10x gain. So I can't say I lost a 1000x+ gain. That's how I justify it in my head, anyway.

14000 - ""fuck, what if this is the last time 'buying a bitcoin' will even be a consideration among the middle-class?""  
19000 - ""yup, i'm an idiot, i should've borrowed money to get in back when i knew to...""

For me when I heard about it it was only mining and somehow the thought just to buy some never crossed my mind.

Sorry I'm replying late.  I'm trying to figure out how to respond to you, because I really understand the mentality you are coming from.  But I'm pretty confident you're just going to reject what I say.

Your entire premise is coming from a point of emotion, and I want to talk to you about the economics of this.


> It is more special because of how it was launched and fairly distributed. We all had an equal chance in 2009 to get as much as we can, there was no special sale or initial coin offering. It was an immaculate conception.

This is 100% emotion.  The way it was launched was *different*, I will grant, but fairly distributed?  Maybe in the sense lottery tickets were.  You had to be tech savvy with access to the right knowledge and hardware to get ahold of Bitcoin.  Do you think it was fairly distributed to someone living in rural Africa?  Or to a roofer living in the US who doesn't use computers much and was laid off in 2008?  Or someone who doesn't speak English and can't find a guide to set it up?  Or someone who was still in grade school in 2009?

It feels fairly distributed because *you* are in the minority group- tech savvy first world English-speakers with a gaming PC in the right age range- that saw it early on.  Baby Boomers would probably argue *housing* was fairly distributed because everyone had the opportunity to buy them as they were being constructed, right?


> The ""work"" aka ""mining is preserved through through protocol of guaranteeing that 1 Bitcoin will still be worth 1 Bitcoin in 100 years.

I'll give you that Bitcoin's algorithm gives you a rough guarantee on the maximum amount of Bitcoin that will ever be in circulation.  You know that the amount of Bitcoin being produced every year for each unit of work will get lower and lower, and there will never be more than 21 million BTC. However, I would argue that from an economics perspective, **this is very bad**.   This makes BTC a horrible currency, and there are only *extremely* select reasons to use it nationally (that make El Salvador an interesting edge case).


I will also give you that Blockchain is probably going to be a big deal in the future and solves a lot of problems that people aren't even aware of today.  For example, banks today still can take 24 hours for wire or ACH transfers and utilize complex swaps to move money around.  A future world where stock shares are NFTs or banks utilize their own internal blockchain systems to instantly move huge amounts of money around (like when you buy a house), or perhaps even house deeds function as NFTs, is very, very possible and would be neat.

But I still argue that Bitcoin is a terrible currency that will objectively make the world worse if mass adopted by the average person.

Basically, there are two main reasons BTC would make a bad currency:


(1) Lack of centralized control (similar to the downsides of the Euro)
(2) The deflationary nature, which makes it horrible.


Point 2 is the bigger issue, but I'll cover point 1 first. 


**Lack of centralized control**

Basically, if you don't control your currency, your country is at risk of a debt spiral when things go wrong.  Economics is weird and isn't 1:1.  When you raise taxes on the middle class, you get less spending, and then you get less economic activity, which reduces revenue. So a 50% tax increase might only increase incomes by 20%...you get diminishing return.  (Far right wingers will sometimes say this is a reason to cut taxes to raise income, but that's bull...it's more of a diminishing return than an inversion.)

So when your country goes into debt combined with an economic recession, taxes aren't a great way out of it.  (Rather, you should tax more when things are good.)  What a country does, then, is print a bunch of money and *pay people to do work*, like building things.  By paying people to do a lot of work, a bunch of economic activity happens, people spend that money, and then the spent money gets taxed, which helps cover the debt.  Bonus: If it causes inflation, that devalues the existing debt.


Well, if you don't control your currency, you can't do that at all.  Which means you have no way to pay off your debt during a recession, so you have to cut spending and raise taxes.  But this makes the recession worse, which means tax revenues don't really budge, and everyone suffers.

This isn't a hypothetical, it's exactly what happened in Greece.  They switched to the Euro, a shared currency, but *lied about their debt balances to qualify for joining the EU*, so then when they had a debt crisis, they were completely screwed and everyone suffered a lot.

Alternatively, the *EU* could have printed a bunch of Euros and handed them to Greece, hurting the rest of Europe to help Greece out, but everyone was pretty miffed about Greece having gone on a spending spree and lying about it to get in and that goodwill wasn't there.

> They just printed 3 trillion out of NOTHING last year. We will continue to pay for that NOTHING through inflation and theft through higher taxes caused by that inflation.

Right, exactly.  If we were using Bitcoin, **we would have been absolutely screwed** by COVID, due to the inability to print money to devalue existing debts.   The US's debt would've prevented us from borrowing more, so the US would have had to dramatically hike taxes instead, and created a much worse recession than COVID did.


(Also, it's not as simple as the US ""printing"" 3 trillion...it printed 3 trillion but gave out a lot of it as low interest loans which have to be repaid.  A lot of that money is ""temporary"" money that actually goes back to the treasury in the end.)

Now, this is a problem in a recession...but the other issue is a problem **always** and potentially a game-ender.


**The Deflationary Nature**

 Bitcoin ITSELF is inherently deflationary by design; it will grow at a slower and slower rate.  As the overall population increases- or even as global wealth increases- at a faster pace than the Bitcoin supply, by law of supply and demand, if Bitcoin was a universally accepted currency, it would always go up in value as it represents more and more of the ever growing wealth in the world.

But a currency that always deflates is a horrible currency, because it means you are incentivized to never spend it.  The longer you hoard it the more valuable it becomes.  With cash, it loses value, which motivates people to spend it now or invest it in something (and investing typically helps create things somewhere, by funding companies or construction or banks).  If the US Dollar went up in value every year, it would be a disaster, because why would you spend if waiting gives you more buying power? You wouldn‚Äôt buy government or municipal bonds that fund construction, you wouldn‚Äôt put your money in banks that loan it out to local businesses, you would just SIT on it.

This is the problem with Bitcoin. It can NEVER be the world‚Äôs primary currency because it is deflationary. Bitcoin‚Äôs best case is that it becomes a speculative store of value like Gold. Bitcoin‚Äôs worst case is that it goes to zero (either because these flaws become obvious, or someone creates a different cryptocurrency that is better designed).

You can argue that the harm of Bitcoin goes far beyond the environmental cost (after all, Bitcoin is literally designed to use as much computing power as physically possible, a massive waste); if people are investing their money in businesses, or government bonds, or even bank accounts, they are funding things.  Banks have to make a return to keep from losing value to inflation, so they lend out to homebuyers for mortgages, or they lend out to local small businesses. But when people store all of their money in Bitcoin‚Ä¶the money is just parked there, creating nothing, and burning a ton of electricity that is required to run Bitcoin because it is literally designed to demand as much electricity as society can provide it.


*I want to reiterate the last paragraph*.

In our current world, money is generally inflationary.  More *value* is created all the time as people build things and the total wealth in the world goes up.  Money is being created all the time by both people's labor (if I build a house, I created money on paper, and I can borrow against it or use it as currency), and by actual governments.  The money supply goes up, and it needs to to account for higher values.

This creates a need to preserve the value of money, which is generally done through investing it.  You can invest it in local governments (government and municipal bonds), where it is usually directly going to funding projects that benefit society, and get a return on it.  You can stick it in a bank account, and get a tiny return; maybe the bank gives you 1% interest, but then loans it out for 3% to people buying homes or starting businesses.   Or you can fund companies, with corporate bonds or stocks.

If you **park your US dollars under your bed**, your money loses value.  You are always incentivized to do something with your money that helps create things elsewhere, whether that's a bank account, or corporate investing, or bonds.  Even if you're just buying real estate, the demand for real estate helps create demand to build houses.


But with Bitcoin, because it is deflationary, *parking your money under the bed* is *profitable*.  By taking money out of circulation, you create an incentive to hoard- and I mean *actually* hoard, not hoarding like Warren Buffett owns stocks, but taking it out of circulation.  And this means *everyone* is worse off, because less gets constructed, less money circulates, less things *happen*.
It was the world trade center that had taken the shorts. The buildings were sentient and had to be taken down. Only one men could do it... [multiple images of people show up really fast with George w, Hussein, bin Laden, and many more so we don't know exactly who it is in the trailer]

Bin Laden was rich as hell, Saudi Binladen Group is the biggest construction company in all of Saudi Arabia. 

The odds of him not knowing someone who could play stocks was about zero
OP said they took huge shorts. I guess it depends of they were unusually high or not to be considered random. It is a bit eerie though. Never heard of it

The problem is that is doesn‚Äôt matter how smart you are if there is only selfish, corrupt assholes to vote for.
It doesn‚Äôt matter who you vote for when no viable candidate cares even the slightest about the actual people in this country.
The system is so controlled by capital that any candidate who makes it far enough for you to vote for them won‚Äôt really care about anything other than ‚Äúgetting theirs‚Äù.
And not just social media, but traditional media, too. I do agree with your sentiment, yet I don't think once should discount the compounding effects of decades of (intended or unintended) psychological manipulation via advertisement and other media sources. Media is built to hijack human attention, and you can't just shut that off without going the extra mile. I find bigger culpability in the architects of these platforms and those who allowed them to grow unabated than the individual who won't take the time to educate oneself. I think we will always find examples of the latter in society, and we should strive to fill those holes as a whole. But agreed, people should read more and be more critical; considering how to get there is a whole other exercise in hopelessness.
The problem is where do you find a news source or other source that isn‚Äôt funded by the wealthy? Most businesses that transmit information have a material interest to support the same things the wealthy want
It wouldn't matter. Not enough people vote and that won't change probably ever. Also, there's this:

https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf
For sure, like at the end of the day we're all responsible for our own actions. But, why would people vote for someone who actively harms them? They wouldn't if it weren't for the media stirring up their emotions to cloud their judgement and straight up lying to them about reality.

>No, it means she's biased against other assets, including the companies that keep the economy running.

What?

>If people in government held only USD, you'd see much less inflation, for example.

Double what?

>This ain't rocket science chief.

No it ain't, it's dumb as fuck that's what it is.
Cash is not speculative in the same way Stocks or crypto is. Are you going to make politicians sell their homes because they would be biased toward that asset? Or should they own all the stocks in the world so they are not biased to any one? 

I‚Äôm also on a lot of other subreddits where I keep my mind open to the possibility that there may be a better way or that I may be wrong. I‚Äôm interested in Crypto but it‚Äôs not my identity and I can still keep the drawbacks and problems with crypto in my head at the same time without my head exploding.
Your argument is probably too complex for most people reading this. I agree with you, but it‚Äôs difficult to get there and you have to make a lot of assumptions (which I think most people don‚Äôt have the capacity to leap to on their own). 

I happen to think you are making a very complicated but smart argument as cash is considered a liquid asset and holding large amounts of currency could make someone a bit biased. For example, if AOC held tons of Yuan we could argue she might be biased in favor of the PRC. But, it‚Äôs a bit more of a stretch because she would be holding dollars in the analogy, and everyone is paid in fiat dollars through the banking system which retains ownership of those funds through legal tender laws, while granting you mere access rights, we ignore the effect that her policy might have on her own cash reserves. The stretch here is that technically the Fed controls inflation targets, which may or may not be constitutional depending on whether inflation is conceptualized as a tax or a market force. But senators can decide not to spend money or print money to spend if it will drive their savings values down through increasing the fiat denominator. Here, we would look to Joe Manchin as a possible conflicted party, but a stretch because we would need to know his true motivations for opposing fiat spending. 

Thus, AOC wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be conflicted because her decisions don‚Äôt affect inflation. That‚Äôs why her opinion on Bitcoin is also fucking dumb ‚Äî because if Bitcoin is a store of value it‚Äôs the same thing as saying: ‚ÄúI never buy any gold because I want to remain conflict-of-interest free.‚Äù Since gold production, like Bitcoin production, is not a central function of any one government, her impact would be minimal, even assuming the us congress were to make a law in opposition. This is simply because crypto holders could just leave and live somewhere else without needing a sovereign to recognize their store of value. Anyway, that‚Äôs just how I see it!
I'm sure she is against the other forms of corruption too. It's kind of her whole thing that got her elected.
yup, that sounds like a fair approach. no argument from me.
>there's really no difference between her boyfriend or any other random person.

That's not an unreasonable position. How a person spends his or her money is a form of expression. The unreasonable thing about the SC's decision was the failure to recognize that A) unlimited money for political campaigns does a lot more harm than good, and B) that the rules they set up to mitigate said harm - that PACs and campaigns cannot directly coordinate - are comically unenforceable.

Good question. In this case governance comes in the form of NFTs. I believe they're currently working on a Proof of Human protocol for voting rights that at least for now seems it would include notarization, but this is definitely something to keep in mind! As society adapts to try and fend off corporations from our governance structure, the powers at play will definitely also be adapting to be able to exert their will.
But when one party decides their strategy is to break everything, and those politicians and voters who don't want to do that have nowhere else to go so they have to back them by default.... and here we are today.

Then they should not be allowed to have a 401k. If you can influence the performance of an investment then you should not be allowed to own it as a government official.
Yes people need to make their own decisions on what‚Äôs best for them and what level of comfort they want to retire to.
What if you systematically favored that area of the country or directed funding to those areas where you owned real estate. Wouldn't that be a conflict of interest? Couldn't it be just as egregious, if not more, as owning 10k of bitcoin and supporting pro crypto laws?

This thread highlights the age and political leanings of this sub.
OK, you own the pebbles. And you keep them on the lawn.

With banks: You own the USD (or whatever). And you keep it on the bank.

&#x200B;

If you are a politician, in the pebble example there would be a conflict of interest when it comes to legislation of anything regarding owning pebbles and keeping them on your lawn. In the other example there would be a conflict of interest when it comes to anything related to keeping USD on the bank. We see the second example as normal, so we tend to not see this conflict of interest, but it's the same.

When it comes to crypto and legislation, banks have an interest in you putting the value you own in USD (or whatever) in a bank account. They don't want you to put your value in a crypto and keep in on your non-custodial wallet. So their lobbying will push in that direction for sure.

If AOC had just as much of her value in crypto on a wallet as USD on a bank, she would be unbiased. If she has even just some meaningful amount, doesn't even have to be 100%, in USD on a bank, and nothing in crypto on a wallet, there is a conflict of interest when it comes to those kind of legislation.
Look at the definition of investing again: ""to put money, effort, time, etc. into something to make a profit or get an advantage"". Does not say ""needs to be shared profit of a company"" or anything in there. Those 0.1% interest is a small profit, admittedly so small that it won't play a part in most people's decision making, but a profit never the less. Deciding factor here is the other advantages I mentioned before. Again, why would people keep their money on bank if they didn't think it gave them any kind of advantage?
Care to suggest another platform that will allow fiat to crypto thru DEX without the use of CEX?

I mean, as per Wikipedia,

So, *nothing* like Boebert whatsoever, actually. lol <smh> 

I swear she's the conservative **ideal** for someone ""pulling themselves up by their bootsraps"" and making something of themselves... but since she's, like, good-looking, brown, and liberal then she's the most evil thing ever. Friggin' hypocritical cowards.
She compares cauliflower to white supremacy. Says the reason unemployment was low is due to people working two jobs. Made a video with Bernie Sanders on a proposed limit on credit card interest rates which is a good thing but then her and Bernie try to do the ""math"" to show how it would help and completely get everything wrong showing they do not even understand what they are trying to do. The Amazon HQ deal She lost was completely due to her not understanding how tax incentives work and thinking it was money already in the citys' coffers as opposed to future tax revenue. AOC says lots of things that sound ""great"" to some people but has offered very little substance to support any of it. She says we need to do this but then gives no way to actually reach the goal.

The usa has the power to destroy the economy.

The usa has the means to destroy and starve other countries supply chains.

This is why countries care about the politics in russia china and the usa. They want to know if they meed to prepare for something big.

>	I‚Äôm aware that she gets more negative media attention than most politicians because of <reason>. I‚Äôm just wondering if there‚Äôs any credence to the claim that she gets more negative media attention.
Yea its nice and good when small changes happen. 

Let me compare it to a person.

Imagine Someone thats 380 pounds. Bernies method (and i love Bernie) is to hide veggies and take away some calories from the food this person eats. Over time this could work

The problem is, the usa (and a couple other countries) are 900 pound humans who are on the verge of not just a heart attack but also getting to heavy for the flooring (think climate change) . At this point drastic lipo will be needed to save the person.
Let me break this down and try to go real slow:

‚ÄúA lot of allegations of *organized crime* are not panning out‚Äù

Does not mean ‚Äúcrime is not happening‚Äù or ‚Äúthat instance that was on camera did not happen.‚Äù

Critical thinking isn‚Äôt your all‚Äôs strong suit. Stop trying to act like it is.
>American politics is all about mischaracterizing your political opponents so you seem like the only reasonable person in the room.

Do you understand how that is ridiculously unprofessional behaviour at best in the eyes of the rest of the world? We have a few politicians like that in our system and they're openly dismissed as unfit for their seat in governance.

And what you're describing is the least of it.
Alright, name some of her far left communist policies she wants to implement.
I said nothing of the sort. If you can't respond to what I said and feel the need to make up a story... why respond to me? You can use your imagination and come up with stories about me without actually involving me if that's how you want to spend your time.
What the hell are you talking about. I never even mentioned oppression you deluded idiot. Not anything about jailing people. And I don‚Äôt know what point you are making but jailing women for selling sexual services or men for being gay are BOTH wrong.

I never said economics equals freedom. Or that it doesn‚Äôt. I just said that monetary policy is different to authoritianism which can be applied to conservative or progressive economic polices. 

I can‚Äôt even work out what your point is. If you are an anarchist then not sure why you prefer the right who like controlling what people do just as much but in different ways.

> Oh boy a fact check that says in reality in was an empty road leading to a camp

You mean, a person cant have intense emotions unless the subject is in your face. Or maybe AOC has eyes and can see from the spot she was standing at. Not everyone needs glasses. 


> That's what annoys me. It's the hypocrisy. It's ok now that they call the shots I guess??

Instead of paratting fox news, you can look up AOC and find different times she has called out both Trump and Biden for their immigration policies.

[Here](https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/aoc-slams-biden-immigration-plan-it-s-wrong-and-it-s-inhumane-114503749521): AOC is criticizing biden, saying his immigration plan ""It's wrong and it's inhumane""

So you should be happy that she has been consistent. 




> You know they resumed doing the exact same thing right?

Another lie. I do not knwo if its because you have been tricked by msm or facebook memes, but there are changes (do there need to be way more changes, fuck yes, but there are still improvements)

Next time you make a claim, try to look up a source, anything that supports your claim. 

So here is a quick summary from BBC talking about the change from trump to biden on boarder immigration. I will admit, while trump might have made the problem worse, but he did not start it. 


> > ""A so-called ""zero-tolerance"" policy under Mr Trump meant families divided by US authorities, in some cases with parents being deported back to their home countries without their children.
> > 
Mr Biden has reversed that specific practice, and some families - but not all - have been reunited.
> > 
A task force set up by the president estimated that 3,913 children had been separated from their parents.
> > 
As of September, authorities were still trying to reach the parents of 303 children separated from their families, according to a court filing.""

There really is no point continuing if you aren't interested in a discussion. You're looking for a ""gotcha"" to prove your own narrative about how I'm a hypocrite.

Everyone is a hypocrite. Just depends on perspective. 

Impossible for someone to believe when they refuse to examine other perspectives and dismiss the majority of what people are saying in order to confirm their narratives.
I do too, but these numbers don‚Äôt account for government help, so anything it does give is just extra.
See, you‚Äôve answered your own question. I didn‚Äôt have to say anything. And that‚Äôs how Reddit works.
Yes I think we agree lol I‚Äôll adjust my original comment for clarity
[Not according to the IRS](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2021/03/02/cryptocurrency-purchases-made-in-usd-are-not-reportable-to-the-irs/)
No you don‚Äôt, you only have to report what you receive through interest, dividends, gifts, etc. and what you gained or lost on your sales. You do not have to report transactions where you‚Äôre the buyer, you simply have to keep a record of it to calculate your gain/loss when you sell.

A lot of people *recommend* that you report your buy record to the IRS so that you have that record on file with the IRS, but you do not *HAVE* to do that.
I personally answer the yes/no question and then report any crypto received (like staking income, Coinbase earn, etc) on line 8 of schedule 1 as ‚Äúhobby income.‚Äù Then you add the USD amount on date of receipt to your basis for capital gains. I report as hobby income,  because it‚Äôs not a lot at this point, but later on it might get reported elsewhere (such as schedule c - small business income, depending on future IRS guidance).

I disagree about AOC being the same. She gets so much hate for having different views and her actions and words speak for themselves. You're judging her without good faith. You are entitled to your opinions though.

US is indeed fucked right now but the ballot box is our only tool for creating change. Unless you want a violent revolution.

But everything you said also applies to every other prominent politician. I mean look at trump - did he utter a word of truth during his whole tenure? And sure, he got a lot of criticism- I guess my point is that the criticism directed at AOC and a few more is very personal. Name calling etc. If she was a he, I really don‚Äôt think it would be half as bad
She had close to $200,000 of outstanding bills not $20,000. $200,000 of unpaid taxes isn't a rounding error. 

Elon Musk is facing a $15 billion+ tax bill this year and has **0** outstanding tax warrants. He is in compliance with US law and up to date on his tax bills.

Stop making excuses for shitty behavior.

Lol this is dumb as fuck
Wait a minute-  I am left wondering what you actually think?  You started by saying she ""doesn't understand it"".  No objections, I don't either. She said she doesn't hold digital assets owing to a personal conviction and her position of responsibility. She didn't single out a currency, security, or digital asset, so where did the ""Banning"" idea come from? ""I'm not saying any of that"", including the idea that lawmaker should not own their own nations currency? Fine, but you then you went to ""if lawmakers shouldn't hold individual stocks we must, using this logic, not allow them to hold any asset, otherwise it isn't equal treatment?""  Didn't you just say you weren't saying that? Where did the notion of treating every asset equally come from? The WHOLE POINT is that she thinks lawmakers should not own individual companies to *avoid conflicts of interest*.  Yes, by virtue of existing within and participating in a society, Lawmakers must make decisions that affect the value of their own currency.  I would submit that this is not a conflict of interest, this is a common interest. The idea is that you want lawmakers acting in the best interest of citizens and to limit the circumstances in which the citizen's interest is different from the lawmakers interest. You assert that we should demand consistency from our reps.  I'd agree.  But to assert that we should either take ZERO steps to limit outside (not the common good) economic influence OR take *every conceivable* step to totally eliminate lawmakers from the economies they legislate for, denies a middle ground. Do you see how ""all or nothing"" fails to address the issue? What are your ideas for a middle ground? What reasonable steps do you advocate for?
I've only recently started using the block feature and it's been a real gift. I consider every second I've spent responding to you a complete waste of my time.   
You'll always have your conspiracies though.
Her responsibility isn‚Äôt to crypto but she‚Äôd be more likely to vote on policies that are bad for her constituents or the economy but are good for her investments. This is why people don‚Äôt want congressmen to actively invest at all

> But the particular politician in question is anything but common sense

Disagree and she's not advocating any tax rates we haven't had before.  Things were pretty cherry economically when we had that tax structure 60 years ago

> If you're in those brackets I think you can agree that a socialist agenda is not in the best interest of our country.

For me financially and personally, sure.  But I'm interested in what is best for the most people.  And that's not the richest 1% hoarding money like dragons and pushing the tax burden onto the poor.  (higher taxes isn't exactly socialism btw)

I'd still be doing very well if I had higher taxes, as would everyone who is richer than me.  And that's not to say higher taxes is just a negative to the rich, they see plenty of benefits too like better infrastructure and less stressed workers.
> If you're in those brackets I think you can agree that a socialist agenda is not in the best interest of our country.

I'd also like to add that a certain level of wealth inequality effectively subverts democracy, which is absolutely not good for the country.  Where you think that line is is very subjective but it'd be hard to make the case that people with $100,000,000,000 are compatible with democracy.

So some people ask ""does any person really need more than a billion dollars?"".  What is the cost to society to allow that kind of wealth accumulation?  Are their extra billions worth our democracy?

XD.

Because no one in their right mind wants to use a currency that has absolutely no stability. If we treat Bitcoin like a currency it's a daily inflation and deflation rates can be higher than a decade of fiat
I would be more than happy to respond, give you a rebuttal and we can revisit this comment in 4 years and again in 10 years.

Fair distribution- you stated that groups of people are/were underprivileged and therefore they did not get a fair chance. Now this is true at face value, but it does not take into account that these same people still have the same chance today (Bitcoin is available in Argentina). I am not computer savvy, I heard about Bitcoin and decided to teach myself about it. You assumed that because I am commenting in a Cryptocurrency thread that I am an early adopter. O wouldn't consider myself early, however, early is relative. Consider this. You, yes you! Can purchase 1 million sats for only $500. So can anybody else. People in Argentina can pick up a couple hundred sats for a buck. My argument here is that the people (earlier) took on more risk of failure and as a result get a bigger reward.

Lack of central control.- that is obviously literally the point of Bitcoin. You argue that a central bank or government needs the power to print money when recession hits. In reality, and in history, this has led to nothing but disaster EVERY TIME. Let's go back and revisit 2009 and the Lehman Brothers collapse. Rehypothecated money between banks was the root cause, these guys were wrapping their bad debt and reselling it as good debt over and over again. The banks  they delt with knew it too, everyone was in on it. When the ponzi was up, the world was brought to a standstill and to the brink of financial collapse. The US government stepped in and bailed out the BAD ACTORS, leaving the American taxpayer on the hook for a half trillion. You argue that we need to print in bad times, but  look at me in the eye and tell with every truth you have in your body and tell me that we won't keep raising the debt ceiling, or we won't need to bail out bad financial actors and the answer is we always will. The market is not allowed to find fair value because doing so is a matter of national security. We can't afford another financial collapse, but ironically we can afford to print. Now this is going to seem a little backwards, but instead of printing more Bitcoin, we can actually just divide it further. 100 million sats can be further broken down into say 1 billion and still have 21million Bitcoin. This as a result allows us to still distribute it across a growing population. You state people would not buy bonds for construction or building. All that the bond issuer would have to do is issue it in Bitcoin itself with a Bitcoin return. This is being done in El Salvador right now and is not necessarily an edge case because it is possible anywhere.

BTC is a terrible currency.- you stated that because of it's deflationary nature, no one will want to spend it because it will only go up. I don't understand an argument that states that when your savings is worth more that is a bad thing. The problem with your assumption that nobody will spend is false because people will still want THINGS and STUFF. They will want to travel, the will want to eat, they will want a place to live. They will need the basic essentials. When people are encouraged to be prudent with their money, it will flow to projects or investments that will give them the most value for their money. That goes for government spending as well. The money would HAVE to be spent wisely. 

Lastly, you state that the energy consumption is disastrous. You fail to compare Bitcoin energy to the energy of every currency in the world combined. The dollar per kilowatt value of Bitcoin is already far more efficient than the current monetary systems of the world. It takes a lot of time and energy to settle with our current banking system. They don't call it PETROL dollar for nothing ! Lol. Lets just assume for a minute that if Bitcoin was actually the world reserve currency,  that we would be talking about 100s of trillions of dollars in value settled instantly. The bitcoin network could handle that with its current computing power safely. Lets also assume that because Bitcoin is the reserve currency, that countries will want to mine it as cheaply and efficiently as possible to get the most value for their work! 

My main point and argument is Bitcoin will flow to the most valuable areas of humanity. The decentralization will encourage peace and cooperation to fund this. Bitcoin as a currency is possible with layer 2 solutions. We will always be early in Bitcoin no matter when we decided to enter.
[deleted]
Yeah, that was kinda the point of the comment. It's a little ridiculous for someone to think that market action like this that was likely from someone with knowledge of something about to happen imminently was a US government official. The guys who were on the planes were all Saudis. The Saudi Sovereign Wealth fund has been a big investor in US markets since the early 70s, and it seems highly unlikely that none of the guys on the planes or the people involved in the intimate details of the planning were not connected high enough to that govt, or even just to someone who had a trading acct on US exchanges.
He might have been Saudi tho :P
With the way things have been done for decades now: that person knew 100%

Really would not be surprised if the trade originated from the middle east or even a sneaky russian, they love using the west against itself more than anything. Someone in the west would also be believable though. That‚Äôs exactly at the depth of shit we‚Äôve been in for over 20 years, easy.

Dianne Feinstein does not act in a way that suggests she cares about her legacy.
I'm not American, but I'm pretty sure AOC genuinely does care for the people of your country. There are some good politicians, some very bad ones, and then some mediocre ones. 

But this sort of broadly ""anti-politics"" perspective isn't very helpful. There's a reason why we have a political system, rather than, say, the feudalism or violent anarchy of the past, that would mean you and I would be either dead, worn-out peasants, or, yes, probably dead again. Our heads staved in by someone's axe.
Then Do something about it. It‚Äôs apathy like this that has led to our current situation.  Be the change you wanna see in the world
Cool so do we just complain about it or actually do something?
I just think that only blaming politicians or the media is lazy. We  allow them to get away with outrageous shit.
The number of people voting is not as relevant as the number of people who educate themselves on who these liars really are.  They lie/distort and fear monger what the evil other side wants to do to you, but you can protect yourself and your children if you could only chip in $xx now to save the future from the horrible other side.  Then, if you are foolish enough to contribute a few buck then the whole party is at your doorsteps with their Hands out an another string of lies.  We have to starve them out and ridicule anyone who gives, and then boycott and shame other entities that give.  Not easy, but the only way out IMO.
Yeah but there is only so much you can blame on the media. We are all responsible for out own actions

Nah bro I'm a monarchist which you should be familiar with as an age of empires player. I'm sorry that you think corruption is necessary.
How do you not get the simple statement, that if politicians held only USD, they'd lose buying power if they pushed for stimulus packages(inflation).

Are you saying inflation doesn't hurt those who hold USD?
I think having assets doesn't imply bias, but you're wrong on cash not being speculative.

Fiat currencies are traded against each other speculatively in forex markets just like cryptocurrencies are traded.
Yes, homes would be the same thing as stocks etc.. In fact, many people say it's in a bubble too.

And no, my main point was that politicians should be allowed to hold assets, such as stocks or real estate, as the goal for unbiasedness is pointless anyways. What they shouldn't do is trade based on insider info, or rather,  give control to a trust such as presidents usually do.
You got downvoted just like me though. But I respect the effort.
Agreed. To many people see crypto as securities, and that's understandable because tokens can be considered a security. The foundation of crypto CURRENCIES is in the name. It's meant to be a replacement of fiat to remove the issuance control from a centralized entities (private banks). Tokens can be seen as shares in a financial service company based in that ecosystem. This subtle nuance seems lost on the speculators in it for exponential gains, but what they probably don't realize is that those gains coincide with the depreciating value of their fiat of choice vs crypto assets in general (due to massive printing/air drops of fiat). It takes a certain mentality to make this leap, but once you do you realize the dangerous nature of these assets and why governments would prefer to regulate them as securities. Unfortunately the massive valuations are speculative in regards to this last part, the ""going mainstream"" that everyone is waiting for, where transactions are no longer done using fiat, but using BTC. The issue, as pointed out, is one of stability, which is valid, but also just an issue of mindset. I'm far from a maximalist, but you kind of have to accept this reality if you are to have any faith in the hugely speculative valuations CC's are at.

I am arguing Bitcoin is also an asset and not a conflict of interest, so your question doesn't really make sense.

Edit: As an example a politician could do the same thing you are saying but with Fiat, forex trading, and monetary policy, but it would sound crazy to ban politicians from holding USD.
If she were a bought politician like republicans, she could have already afforded to easily pay off her student debt. But she is not.

Oh no doubt, reddit gonna reddit, just surprised me how closely correlated the opinion is in here to the cess pool that is /r/politics.
>  In the other example there would be a conflict of interest when it comes to anything related to keeping USD on the bank.

I simply don't agree that's true beyond, you know, wanting your funds to be safe and accessible. The bank making more money doesn't really help you as an account holder. If anything you'd want them to take fewer risks and might want to implement some rules they don't like to achieve this. That's what I mean when I say the interests of banks and account holders aren't aligned. The bank wants to use your deposit to make as much profit as possible. You, as an account holder.... don't necessarily want that, do you?

> They don't want you to put your value in a crypto and keep in on your non-custodial wallet. So their lobbying will push in that direction for sure.

Same argument could be made for cash. Besides, who's to say banks won't start offering crypto options to customers. Even or maybe especially with crypto, people aren't necessarily going to want to custody large amounts themselves so there's room for trusted / insured entities to offer custodial services.

I think you're really talking about USD vs bitcoin, not banks vs bitcoin. But it seems kind of weird to expect a US politician to divest from the US dollar. Do you expect a US politician to hold Euros to reduce bias between those currencies as well? Should they hold oil stocks to make sure they're not biased against oil companies? Just seems like a weird argument.
what an absolutely asinine criteria for ""unbiased""

If a politician owned equal amounts of BTC and BAC stock, would you really call them unbiased?
Yeah I was trying to respond in a neutral way but comparing the two is so ludicrous. She‚Äôs the exact type of story that the right would love and promote all day, if she didn‚Äôt end up with progressive beliefs.
Ocasio-Cortez lies to pump up her base and Lauren Boebert does as well. I don't see how AOC having a degree makes her false claims and more true but apparently you do
I don't care about what she looks like, I don't even care about her politics. I support Illhan Omar even though I disagree with her but not AOC. What does that make me? I don't like the lie AOC tells so I guess that makes me a hypocritical coward...

Also just because someone has a degree doesn't mean they are smart. Ted Cruz went to Harvard and Trump went to Penn, both of those are very prestigious schools. Does that mean everyone that criticizes them just hates white men or do they in fact say and do things that are insane?
She was recruited, just like many political candidates are, by groups who believe the candidate will be a good fit for their district. It happens all over the country, all the time, at all political levels. Don't be scared!

You still haven't explained what her recruitment has to do with propaganda.
True
I don't believe that at all.
Speaking from experience, clearly.
I‚Äôm pretty sure any country that has nukes has the power to end the world lol more than the United States have nuclear weapons

It is what it is.  It's not unique to any one politician or political party so it's very easy for both sides to play the ""our political opponents are ignoramuses"" card.
Well few examples here why she is far leftie (in general not just socialist orientated): support for critical race theory in schools, taxing the rich (she has no clue how that works and whole world  should rather tax corporations), support for trans athletes even tough we know how they can demolaih competition. Cant remember more tough i was roling my eyes at her spewing quite a few times. She ia prime example of blindly believe everything in your political spectrum. No spine what so ever. 

Edit: also she is quite rich. So will she tax herself more?
I mean you just completely skirted the issue by saying I'm just targeting her bc she's a us politician... I'm targeting her because she's dangerous bc people take cyanide pills if it's hidden in a cupcake
You fucken moron. There's a reason authys like you tend to run countries into the ground.

Just exercise your mental faculties. Stop being hung up on words and then understand hurting people for exchanging money is wrong.

Your dear leader beyotch wishes to do that. She wants to throw people in jail for exchanging money on a consensual basis.

Anyway you're here to make a quick buck on this sub because you have no real life skill anyway. Good luck.
I was simply pointing out there was a politically motivated group that recruited her and essentially got her elected into office but that escalated quickly.
[deleted]
So you are admitting that a large number of people don't like her because of her race and gender, and to justify this point out that you believe the other side does this as well? it sounds like you agree with seeders but see this as a larger societal problem that needs addressing.
Youre grand standing my friend. You go online and preach absolutele truths, while subscribing to the belief that no absolute truths exists. You're absolutely right that I have no interest in this debate because you've shown that you don't even believe your own nonsense
Basically, if you bought $10 worth of X last year, and sold it for $100 worth of Y this year:

On last years taxes you don‚Äôt have to report anything because you didn‚Äôt sell anything

On this year‚Äôs taxes you don‚Äôt have to report that you bought Y, but, you do have to report that you made a $90 gain selling X.

This means that, as long as you aren‚Äôt selling anything, you can be buying as much crypto as you want for as long as you want without every needing to report it to the IRS. You just need to keep a record of when you bought it and how much you bought it for so you can report your gain when you eventually do sell.
THE FACT IS HE ANSWERED TO THE DAMN PRESIDENT REGARDLESS OF WHO PREVIOUSLY APPOINTED HIM

ffs how do you lack the mental capacity to process this? it's astonishing
Possibly dumb question here, are you required to report crypto holdings or only if you pull out crypto? It seems like that is when it would be taxable. If that's the case the other poster is correct  there is no way to verify if she or any other representative are holding crypto. I know the government requires disclosure of all holdings, stock and crypto for some things, I just don't  know how that pertains to the house or senate.
Well like I said, if she gets something real and meaningful done to fix the problems of this country, I'll believe it. I am judging her without good faith, which I feel is the most logical way to judge any politician. I definitely don't want violent revolution at all, I fear it. I hope I am fortunate enough to die before that occurs. But with financial crisis looming, we are closer than ever.

And thanks but no thanks on that reddit vault thing. I'm just here to lurk and randomly confront comments that get under my skin.

Everyone in congress is bad? or just the left and Bernie? The shit you‚Äôre pointing out has been done a thousand times over by your average politician. Trump literally said he‚Äôd grab em by the pussy and no one cared
It's not about her sex. It's about her labeling people as nazi's, it's about her marxist ideology, it's about her making wildly inaccurate statements as fact and not willing to debate anyone who disagrees.

> She had close to $200,000 of outstanding bills not $20,000. 

Source?

the reporting I saw was unable to confirm that any of the bills were still outstanding.
Give me reasons then.
Nobody is disagreeing with that. Trump just did far more damage than anyone else has managed.
Sigh this is why we will never get a viable third party‚Ä¶

But it‚Äôs your vote. 

So question if you‚Äôre more of a libertarian how did you arrive at Biden over Trump?
Do you have any proof of her not knowing the three branches of government? She gets misquoted/lied about in right wing media all the time. Unless you're giving a direct quote, your understanding of who she is is way misguided.
honestly at this point I'm not sure you understand what I'm referring to at all, good day sir or madam
Many people don't understand that bitcoin is no more an investment vehicle than dollars or pounds or any other currency exchange.  For some reason, people think it's like a stock - and judging it as such - so much so that there is specific line items in IRS forms... INSANE!  My understanding is that AOC thinks Bitcoin is some sort of investment vehicle instead of simply a currency.

So if her logic stands that Bitcoin IS an investment vehicle (which it isn't, but just suppose) then ALL currencies are an investment vehicle, and by her logic not be allowed to be traded as such - just like a stock.

If Bitcoin is understood to be just a currency, then there is no reason for her to not have any - hence her personal ban becomes a vendetta against a specific currency - which is corruption and a conflict of interest; That is unless, AOC also believes that all currencies are evil and not to be held by current representatives - then she will have consistent logic; and consequently must give up holding US Dollars - and not be a hypocrite.

""Banning"" symbolized the phrase  - ""a personal conviction that she should not hold in her personal possession.""  Shorthand.  I'm not talking about any sort of legislation to ban anything... just her personal ban on having it.

My opinion? I don't care - as long as there is a consistency in logic. Seriously, I really don't care what she does as long as it is consistent.  Her virtue signaling is meaningless to me.  And representatives that are hypocrites should be hanged for treason.

If you are asking my opinion in general to cut down on corruption? I think it's pretty clear by now, but I'll state it plainly: Representatives should not be allowed to buy, sell, be gifted, or gift anything smaller than an index fund during their term(s).  And they shouldn't even be thinking about the currency market.
But holding debt, cash, or bonds is investing. And would influence you.

To not be influenced by her assets she would have to hold no assets.  To not be influenced by her liabilities she would have to hold no liabilities.
$50k dress. ‚ÄúEat the rich‚Äù.

Yes I‚Äôm sure vanity had nothing to do with that gala. Purely for the good of the people.

No. You‚Äôre definitely the naive one in this conversation.
I want things to improve for all Americans as well. But I don't know... A marginal tax rate of up to 70% is not common sense. Neither is defunding the police, cancelling student loan debt (this was a CHOICE of everyone who took out a loan), abolishing US Immigration and Customs, and whatever it is she wants to do with gun control...
This is definitely an interesting point. It's mind blowing to start thinking about how much tens and hundreds of billions of dollars is-- let alone that a single person or family has accumulated that much wealth. 

When you say this kind of wealth subverts or is not compatible with democracy-- I whole heatedly want to agree with you. Democracy is something every American should fight for. I really don't know enough about how this much wealth impacts democracy to have an opinion. You've given me something to look into that's for sure. I would hope that this wealth is a reflection of the value this person or family has added to society-- and for most new wealth I'd think this to be true. But for the generations of inherited wealth I can see not as much... 

The thing that really doesn't sit well with me is telling someone ok you're too successful and taking a percentage (or massive chunk) of their wealth from them. In an ideal situation the people with this much wealth would turn around and do something amazing for society with it. But I understand that's not the case a lot of the time and instead it's hoarded or used in a less than positive way-- wasteful, extravagant, etc. And on top of this-- where's the line? How much is too much? To someone who's surviving on less than $30k/yr -- $100k may seem excessive. But people making $100k know it's nowhere near enough (depending on desired lifestyle)... 

I'm also not a believer that the government is the best steward of resources-- which is my own primary point to resist a redistribution of wealth approach. 

Regardless of how we may differ on our views of this we as a country have some work to do. A blanket tax the rich approach is just so anti-American I don't see that ever working out. It actually reminds me of turning off the scoreboard in kids games if a team starts scoring too many points, or giving kids trophies for last place. What becomes the incentive to succeed if the reward will be dramatically stripped if a certain threshold is reached? It's almost an incentive to strive for mediocrity.
Are you suggesting he not buy more Bitcoin?

AOC is a bought-out corporate democrat like the rest. 

I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúall politicians‚Äù, I specifically said ‚Äúviable‚Äù because *actual* good people don‚Äôt make it to high-level offices. Their campaigns are drowned out by the massive, expensive campaigns that the 2 big parties have.
You believe the bullshit the American press is selling you then
Yea! Do something! Put your entire life on hold, participate in a years long multi million dollar popularity contest. And if you happen to win spend the next several years arguing with other people about how to best boss around a bunch of other people neither of you have ever met! Gah! Apathy.... Just participate in the system.
Sure thing, dude. Lemme just completely change our entire system of government. Put it right at the top of the list. Gonna take the next train to D.C., give a heartfelt speech to Congress, then they'll applaud and all resign immediately.
I think educating ourselves and understanding the dynamics and logical conclusions of a capitalist system is doing something about it. 

I also think civic duty is important because while no candidate will ever make real change, we can pick the candidates with the least oppressive ideologies. Politics isn‚Äôt the arena to make real change, but if managed well, can improve the conditions for labor in spite of itself. 

As I mentioned elsewhere, labor holds the power for meaningful change. The capitalist system has long separated individuals from the means of survival. Concentration of labor into cities has stripped labor of the means to produce for itself (no land, no food). An education system designed to produce workers has led to a loss of connection to the means of survival. If we can solve the problems of ‚Äúhow will I feed myself/family‚Äù, we can actually make moves towards a general strike. With a significant reduction in capitalist production (general strike) and a halt of ‚Äúthe economy‚Äù because a large percentage of consumers simply aren‚Äôt consuming, we can hit the capitalist class where they‚Äôll actually pay attention. 

We could actually end this parasitic system if enough people would get over the idea that if they just try hard enough or get lucky gambling on stocks and crypto, they‚Äôll ‚Äúbecome a capitalist too!‚Äù
True, man. The level of corruption is nuts these days. Here's hoping we can one day get off our asses collectively.
Children are for the stew.
Well I‚Äôm not here to talk to all of the down-voters was just trying to talk to you!!

>""In the other example there would be a conflict of interest when it comes to anything related to keeping USD on the bank.""

You could just as well say that having money in crypto on a non-custodial wallet is not a conflict of interest beyond, you know, wanting your funds to be safe and accessible. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

>But it seems kind of weird to expect a US politician to divest from the US dollar.

Exactly, that's why I would never expect an US politician to be unbiased when it comes to USD. And if those politicians keep a significant amount of USD on a bank account, as all of them do, I would not expect them to be unbiased when it comes banks either.
When it comes to legislation regarding both BTC and BAC stock? Yes.

You can still be biased for other reasons of course. But there would be no direct conflict of interest from owning both BTC and BAC stock. Just like you could still be unbiased if you had 100% in either, but there would be a conflict of interest for sure.
I wasn't directing that at you, apologies for not being clear on that. 

Fair enough with regards to degrees and what not. 

I think she's largely in politics for all the right reasons - in a selfless way. I'm not sure what you're referring to when it comes to ""the lie"" and what not.
Trump bought his spot in.

Cruz is intelligent, but is playing a part, similar to Boris Johnson, who went to Cambridge.

AOC is just a girl from NYC. She got in on her own merit.

Ditto.
>	This comment chain is saying she gets more attention because of something else

The comment chain never claimed that. You‚Äôre doing the thing that you‚Äôre getting all bent out of shape about.
So you just ignored my analogy.
I understand you're not american so you probably won't understand any explanation I would give on CRT, but here's something you can test in the future, ask a random american if they know about the Tulsa Massacre, or maybe the Immigration Act of 1924, how about the Trail of Tears? They probably don't know any of that, but they could probably tell you Christopher Columbus is a fine and dandy fellow that founded America! There's a reason CRT should be taught in schools, for the same reason American's don't know any atrocity besides 9/11 (of which one is happening per day in terms of deaths). If you think being able to understand and dissect information to get a better meaning is communist, I think you are a communist based on what you said in your earlier comment ü§£. 

Why exactly does she have no clue how taxing the rich would work? Maybe it's you who has no idea what she knows? She literally double-majored in college, one being economics, so maybe you're the idiot who has no clue how that works? Once again you're not American but I hope you realize that the income taxes AOC advocates for are actually lower than what they used to be in the US...  

I can't personally speak on trans athletes nor do I care much since it's such a small problem in the world that rarely if ever actually affects anything, but I have heard that people who transition tend to fall into female levels of athleticism (like lung capacity, running and cycling ability, etc) after they do hormone therapy, so with facts like that what do you have against trans athletes? And how is being trans communist? 

I have been rolling my eyes at you spewing disinformation, does that make you a nazi? No, well maybe I don't know you. And yes, if she were rich (if you consider having a net worth less than 30k, not taking corporate bribes like 99% of politicians, and having tens of thousands in student debt rich) she would love to tax herself more. 

I don't know how Slovenia works but just because you read your uncle's post stating that AOC is a rich communist trans lover doesn't mean your uncle is the messiah. Be more critical of things you read bro.
Critical race theory has no relationship to communism

Supporting trans athletes has nothing to do with communism 

Taxing the rich has nothing to do with communism

This was a fun talk. Go find deeper talking points. The ones you‚Äôre using are failing you.
Maybe I've skipped you but I've asked everyone who brought up these things to be more specific and so far nobody could or was willing to.

Just some vague bla bla she's bad/evil/stupid/dangerous/other nonsense without being able to say anything specific. Which is about as much as Id expect.
Ignore that fool, he's an ass on purpose on reddit
Lol. You really have a few screws lose and don‚Äôt even know what you are arguing. 

I‚Äôm not American so Aoc is nothing to me. But where were we talking about her putting people in jail for exchanging services. What planet are you on?

Edit: Also I find it hilarious that you previously in another thread used a political compass meme to prove a point but you obviously don‚Äôt even understand what you used. Because the bloody meme shows that authoritarianism is on the vertical scale completely seperate to the economic one which proves the only point I was try to make. God damn Americans like you are stupid.

How dense are you? Unreal that‚Äôs your conclusion. I call out your hypocrisy and like a normal CNN liberal you jump straight to a complete twist in words.

People don‚Äôt like her cause she has polarizing views and proposes socialist nonsense like Green New Deal.
Like I said, you focus on one tiny fraction of what I said and ignore the rest. How else can this be described if not narrow-minded? You're narrow focused. This was never a debate. You weren't debating anything. You were just telling me your biases and political affiliation.

You call it nonsense and yet seemed to fail to comment on 95% of it. Because you immediately dismissed it. Because you are not willing to consider other perspectives. Just like any ideologically driven person throughout history.

Good luck with that
Yeah proper record keeping is where most people fall short - and since the exchanges don‚Äôt do it for you, I can see a lot of people having issues for years to come, based on ignorance more than intention to evade taxes (don‚Äôt see how the IRS will ever be able to catch even a fraction of crypto investors though).

But the comments and slurs made towards her dont come across with things like that - they just result to name calling. Even looking through this thread - very little criticizing her proposed policies (many of which I do NOT agree with), but loads calling her a dumbass and more. I mean, clearly she is quite clever - look where she is in life. People seem to feel its ok to attack her personally rather than politically. Its just crass.
>The fact that Elon has 0 outstanding tax warrants is just semantics, he doesn‚Äôt pull his fair share and that‚Äôs kinda AOC‚Äôs whole platform. 

It's not semantics. We can tax the rich more and I'm in favor of that. It is AOC's job to get that legislation pushed through and has nothing to do with Elon Musk, whom you brought up.

> She isn‚Äôt going after the shitty people who evade $100k in taxes, she doesn‚Äôt got time for that considering she has to devote all of her time to trying to tax the 1%.

No one is asking her to go after shitty people who evade $200k in taxes. (I like how you keep changing the number to something lower, as if you think it helps your argument). 

The only thing I've said is she shouldn't hire someone who is actively engaged in tax evasion to push her platform for higher taxes.

Stop making excuses for shitty behavior.
Lol. ""Tax the rich by making laws but let my friends who avoid taxes go"".

Do you have any data that shows the warrants were satisfied?

> The company racked up three open tax warrants in New York state for failing to withhold income taxes from employees‚Äô paychecks totaling $14,798, the state Department of Taxation and Finance told The Post. The debts ‚Äî which were incurred before the pandemic ‚Äî stem from 2018 and 2019. The company has been hit with 15 warrants in total since 2015.

> The company got into a deeper hole with the feds. Between April 2018 and April 2019, the Internal Revenue Service placed six federal liens on Cultural Brokerage Agency totaling $103,220. The liens specifically cite the company‚Äôs failure to remit employee payroll taxes.

> I would hope that this wealth is a reflection of the value this person or family has added to society

In a perfect system, sure, but of course we have gaps like generational wealth that you've pointed out.  Not everyone has the same opportunity.  Nor is the value equation air tight.  Did they take a massive gamble and get lucky with an investment?  What value has that really provided?  What damage did they have to do to provide that ""value"" and how many people did they have to exploit and step on to get there?  How much pollution did they dump in the lake and get away with?

There's so many places where the system doesn't reward net value (or punish damages) properly or proportionately.  If you were in an MMORPG and everyone had about 50 gold and that was enough for the game, but then someone walked by with 20 billion gold, you probably wouldn't think they earned that and it was more likely they got it through an exploit or something.  To consider money to be proportional to value provided to society, you'd have think that the ultra wealthy provided 1,000,000 times as much value to society as the average person.  I don't think that is anywhere near right

> The thing that really doesn't sit well with me is telling someone ok you're too successful and taking a percentage (or massive chunk) of their wealth from them...And on top of this-- where's the line? How much is too much?

That's for voters to decide, but we don't really have to draw a line, it's a gradual tax increase not a sudden wealth limit of $1B

> A blanket tax the rich approach is just so anti-American I don't see that ever working out. It actually reminds me of turning off the scoreboard in kids games if a team starts scoring too many points, or giving kids trophies for last place. What becomes the incentive to succeed if the reward will be dramatically stripped if a certain threshold is reached? It's almost an incentive to strive for mediocrity.

There isn't 0 incentive, it's just diminishing returns.  With a 70% top tax rate, you're still keeping 30% of what you earn.  That's not even different from the lower tax brackets.  You get taxed slightly more the more you earn but you're still always earning more after taxes.  Would you ever tell me you didn't want a raise?
My problem was that I was mining Doge. üòÇ
I'm pretty sure AOC is not a corporate democrat at all. She spends much of her time demanding corporation tax increases, improved labor laws, and political reform re: corporate lobbying. How is she, of all people, 'bought out'? Fairly sure major corporations despise her.
Oh, and pretty much put yourself and family through hell

Having money also helps isolate you from these problems. I‚Äôm never going to have that type of money in America, not at least anytime soon.

But yeah, this comment section is weird. Belittle ITT grads trying to get real world skills, but laude AOC for doing good on a science fair in HS.
> You could just as well say that having money in crypto on a non-custodial wallet is not a conflict of interest beyond, you know, wanting your funds to be safe and accessible

You could but you'd look silly since bitcoin is a highly speculative asset and USD, you know, isn't.

> And if those politicians keep a significant amount of USD on a bank account, as all of them do, I would not expect them to be unbiased when it comes banks either.

Well that's silly. As I've said several times, in several different ways, lots of people have money in banks they hate.
If a politician owed a bunch of BAC stock, I would not trust them to appropriately regulate Bank of America, because if the bank should be sanctioned / regulated / fined / otherwise punished, it would hurt the stock. Since people are motivated by greed, especially politicians, I would assume that large holdings of BAC would make that politician less willing to punish Bank of America for wrongdoing, even if it was the right thing to do.

Same with BTC. A politician who owned a bunch of BTC, I would not trust to appropriately and fairly regulate the industry. They might back off of the *right* moves, if it had the potential for downward price pressure. Would you feel the same about a politician *long on* BTC as a politician *shorting* BTC? If not, it shows your own clear bias towards BTC.

But if a politician has savings at a bank, or money in a bank's checking account? Those funds aren't affected at all by any decisions made against the bank. Even if somehow the government seized the bank or something, those assets are still insured. A politician's $100,000 in savings isn't going to go up, or down, based on actions taken against the bank. There's no incentive to do, or not do, anything in relation to that bank.

I think politicians should invest in a blind trust that they do not have control over. If that blind trust has crypto assets, so be it. It's their right to invest their wealth, but they shouldn't be allowed to hold individual stocks or play the market.
She lied about the Amazon HQ and said they were taking funding from local teachers, she lied about how unemployment statistics are calculated, she lied about how ARP is calculated. I would think someone from a top 20 university with a very prestigious Economics department would at least have a basic understanding of these things. I have multiple Economics degrees and she says stuff that would have gotten me laughed out of my undergrad classes. If you choose not to see any of her comments as lies just know that you are the same as the trumpers to me because the only way we can solve our problems is by actually addressing them with the TRUTH and if you have to lie to get your point across I have no time for you
>She has a political machine behind her, creating propaganda. 

If you consider all political advertising propaganda, sure. Kind of a loose definition, but if that's your frame of reference, whatever. 

I never said there is *no* pro-AOC propaganda... my point was there is *far more* anti-AOC propaganda than their is pro-AOC propaganda. 

AOC is literally attacked by everyone on the right - she's featured in GOP political advertisements from New York to Florida, Texas to Montana. Much of what's said about her in those contexts is false or misleading. This type of propaganda continues to this day.

Not to mention, she is literally *anti-establishment.* In her first primary race, she literally went up against Joe Crowley, the Democratic Caucus Chair. So we know that the establishment left went hard against her in 2018. There was likely plenty of anti-AOC propaganda created during that period.
>The person I replied to said ""I mean she already has my respect for being the only American politician who is actually decent and doesn't need to be locked in a mental asylum.""  
>  
>Do you agree with statement?

No, I do not. I think there are quite a few American politicians who are decent, across the entire country.

Also, I think there are very few politicians who need to be ""locked in a mental asylum"", mostly because I don't think corruption, idiocy, and indecency qualifies you for a forced commitment to a mental asylum.
maybe what you meant to say is ""I don't understand what the majority of Americans are even voting for""

Because that's really what it is - *you* don't know why they vote the way they do. That doesn't mean *they* don't know why they vote the way they do.

What you originally said is basically the ""everyone but me is an NPC"" type attitude.

She won a popularity contest. Nothing more in my view.
Elon‚Äôs just an example I chose. 

The figure I saw was $100k, not $200k, which is why I said $100k.

I even said that she was a shitty person, not sure how I‚Äôm making an excuse for her. I‚Äôm just comparing the sheer scale that AOC is going after vs what her designer did. Not comparable and is basically just an argument used against AOC for some reason by most right-wing media sources. 

I‚Äôm tired of this discussion lol. Nothing‚Äôs going to change.
I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs already laws against tax evasion in place and that it‚Äôs the IRS‚Äô job to get her to pay and not AOC‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Her job is to change the rules that agencies like the IRS operate by. Also, we wouldn‚Äôt be bringing up her tax evasion had they not caught her, so what else is AOC supposed to do, make the IRS do their jobs?
1.	No clue what you‚Äôre talking about. 
2.	Everyone had to be vaccinated and be masked when not eating, after the photoshoot, at the MetGala

If that‚Äôs your reasoning, you‚Äôre clearly against her for something else. None of that constitutes her being a ‚Äúpiece of shit‚Äù.
Yeah lol, she literally didn't say branches because she didn't mean branches. JFC you're easily propagandized.

It's pretty clear in the context she's not talking about the three branches. You don't get elected to the judicial branch, so how would anyone goo about running for that branch, Copernicus?

That's like saying someone's definition of a word is wrong when they're not using the word you're defining for them. 

""You told me a club sandwich isn't a hot dog"" 

""Lol they don't know what a corn dog is""
I don‚Äôt have to have a solution to point out obvious logical faults.  

I imagine the solution would be to have a market cap weight portfolio of all investable assets.  (Possibly including all fiat currencies)  That way they have no dog in the fights.

That‚Äôs obviously better and less influential than her strategy right?  It took me like 30 seconds to think of it.

Her strategy has Significant motivation to prevent Bitcoin from capturing the monetary premium of all assets.  Really really significant motivation.  Like half her net worth significant.

>But if a politician has savings at a bank, or money in a bank's checking account? Those funds aren't affected at all by any decisions made against the bank. Even if somehow the government seized the bank or something, those assets are still insured. Your $10,000 in savings isn't going to go up, or down, based on actions taken against the bank. There's no incentive to do, or not do, anything in relation to that bank.

Hm, maybe that's because of legislation regarding banks and saving accounts?
Yeah, I agree that there's virtue and importance in seeking out the truth, regardless of political stance. 

As for the specific issues you laid out, I'm not entirely sure about all that. There aren't any links and you're just asking me to take your word for it. What I can say, though, is that I don't trust Amazon and think they're largely a scummy company.
Wait. 

So your first comment was ‚Äúwhy do other countries care about us politics‚Äù

And your last comment was about how you actually keep up with world affairs
Because you‚Äôre not asking in good faith. The answer to your question is the literally subject of this post. Things like the subject of this post show that she takes her job seriously. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs popular in the progressive wing of the party, and that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs unpopular amongst conservatives. There‚Äôs no other thing, you‚Äôre the only one who‚Äôs trying to argue about there being another thing.
They are referring to the same thing you yourself said - a lot of misleading info about her‚Ä¶.
If we were the 350 pound person sure, but we have been putting off actually getting the problems fixed  for so long that we are at the next critical junction. Small changes (while good) will not stop the heart attack thats approaching.  If aoc tries the bernie method, we will just get stuck putting the lipo off like we have been doing for so long.

You gotta remember though, bernie (and few others) are still doing the small stuff. So aoc can focus on drastic measures and hopefully find enough support in more americans.

Remember, the planet is already fucked. How fucked we are dependa on what we do now.
You didn't ask me what I believe, you merely projected your own expectations. You have become your own shadow puppeteer and that's kind of sad.

> Not comparable and is basically just an argument used against AOC for some reason by most right-wing media sources.

Wow. If that's all you've concluded after this entire discussion, then I agree that it's best to end this discussion.

Enjoy your day.
1. When she was at the ICE facility crying over the children which she couldn't see, hear or even knew if there were any there. Her team and her promptly uploaded pictures though leaving out the parking lot behind the fence to make it seem as though she was crying at a fence keeping her from poor children. It was a horrible look. 
2. People who are vaccinated can still spread and catch COVID. The entire event was a photoshoot and dinner so they spent the majority of the time without a mask on. It also doesn't look good when you force the servants to be masked while you're not, in the same setting. Getting your picture taken shouldn't mean you have special privileges when sharing the space. Unless you think there should be second class citizens.

And that's just a small sample size as to why I'm against her. I think she doesn't know what she's talking about and her green new deal is a shining example. It reads like an average high school paper. Her lack of geopolitics is embarrassing and yet she still interjects. And I can ramble on about her. She's just not our best nor brightest and worse off, she is part of the DSA which runs counter to our constitution, a document she swore to uphold.
I mean, there are no ""three chambers"" of government.

alright you're just being disingenuous now

I hope
You mean like FICO insurance? Yeah, FICO insurance benefits every American with a bank account. Would be nice to see FICO insurance extended to cover assets held with crypto lending platforms.

But yeah, the point stands. Holding money at a bank may *benefit* the bank marginally (more assets to fractionalize and lend out), but I don't see how having savings at a bank counts as ""investing"" in that bank. The fate of your money is not affected by legislation you may pass. 

If FICO was rescinded tomorrow, your bank account won't change value - but I bet BAC stock falls. 

If overdraft fees were banned tomorrow with legislation, your bank account won't change value - but your BAC stock would probably drop.
What are you not sure about? All of my critiques are true and the beauty is you do not have to believe me you can go and look for yourself. I don't like amazon either, I think NYC gave them too many incentives for their HQ but why couldn't AOC have said that?
Yeah my comment is asking why do people put their two cents into United States politics when other countries are equally as important. Fucking duh bro not just the US has the power to end the world. I don‚Äôt involve myself in other countries politics because it‚Äôs all the same.
The answer to 

>	I‚Äôm asking if there‚Äôs actually any credence to the claim that she gets disproportionately more [false claims about her].

is literally the subject of this post? My question was never was why she received progressive support, it was pretty explicitly asking about the claim the false claims about her. 

I said that all false claims and negative media about her are purely from her popularity because she seems to get the same as any other politician of the same prominence. The comments I replied to are pretty clearly trying to attribute the false claims to something else. 

I understand it‚Äôs difficult to distinguish whether media hate is from popularity or it‚Äôs from her ‚Äútaking her job seriously‚Äù. It‚Äôs close to a chicken and egg scenario. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm pointing out that politicians of the same popularity recieve a pretty identical amount of false claims about them, regardless of how seriously they take their job. 

Can you explain why you think I‚Äôm arguing in bad faith? It‚Äôs a Reddit comment section and I politely responded to a comment I disagreed with asking to clarify what they‚Äôre referring to.
Yes, but we‚Äôre disagreeing on the reason for this misinformation.
She won‚Äôt work with anyone tho like I said she could work with the libertarian right to free non violent drug offenders, that‚Äôs a big step that would drastically improve the lives of thousands of people but she chooses not to

i know you're just trying to save face at this point, but the IRS even apologized for doing it.

this is your legacy. just a bunch of tyrants that refuse to take accountability for the bad things they do. the same story of marxists the world over all throughout history.
I‚Äôve seen your other comments and think you‚Äôre just a shitty person, so I‚Äôm gonna end it here. I have a response to almost everything you said but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre worth my time or the energy to continue this because it surely will just keep going.
There don't have to be for her not to mean branches of government. 

There are three federal offices for which positions are elected. It's not hard to see that this is what she was hinting at, especially when she literally qualified this with those three and literally didn't use the word she was allegedly defining (according to Beck). 

Glenn Beck has everything to win by portraying her like this, but that's all it is. It's a deligitimation campaign aimed at someone actually trying to make a positive change for the common American.

Well, you are obviously out of arguments.
>I don't see how having savings at a bank counts as ""investing"" in that bank.

Ok I'll explain it once more.

Investing means to put money, effort, time, etc. into something to make a profit or get an advantage, as said.

Why do you have your money on a bank account? To get an profit or get an advantage. Ergo, it's investing. Simple as that.

Historically, direct financial profit used to play a bigger role. That's how I still learned it as a kid! Put your money in the bank, get interest, ""let the money work for you"". Now with almost 0% interest, this does not play a role for most people anymore.\* Why do people still keep their money on the bank? Because of those other benefits: Relative security (yes, partly because of legislation), ease of use etc. If people would not think they had any advantage keeping their money in an bank account, they wouldn't do it.

Look, I'm well aware that people usually don't consider putting money on a bank account investing. That's just the normal thing to do. But if you simply look at the definition of investing you can easily see it is. Don't force me to quote Kant, the father of ""DYOR""!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*Little detail: Still works for filthy rich people though! 0.1% might be nothing for you and me, but if you got 100 Million USD that's still $100k a year, enough to live comfortably without ever touching your initial investment.
I don't really have the time or wherewithal to go through all of the minutiae of what you're specifically talking about with each of those points. I briefly looked for the Amazon thing, but couldn't find anything referring to what you're saying; just the main articles of the day from over 2 years ago. I don't want to spend more time related to the issue. I'm not saying I think you're lying, just that I am not sure if you're accurate in your position or, perhaps, misunderstanding something.
> it‚Äôs all the same.

Its not all the same. Contrary to what the US education system wants its kids to believe, the USA is not the greatest country in the world. It absolutely has so many different ways it can improve and learn from other countries. 

But in any case, even if you dont feel like it, everyone is entitled to give their opinion. Think of the world as a neighborhood. If you see your neighbor fucking the dog, I hope you would say something. Cause I would.
You seem to have so little capability for free thought that a human conversation is an unachievable goal. This is a community of 4m people, to assume that all of them are your political opposition is something only a cave dweller could do. We are not here because our politics are similar, we are here because of our interests in cryptocurrency. You have used logical fallacy to decide that 4m people are all liberal snowflakes, it's not a good look for someone who came into the thread pushing ‚ÄãCave allegory of all things.

I dont care what your politics are. If you had come in here doing the exact opposite and accusing every unrelated comment of supporting far right ideals, you would look 100% as sheepish.

And you even called me triggered! Just let me put it on my liberal snowflake bingo card. ü§£

Sure you do cupcake. That's why you chose to waste time going through my comments and write this instead of arguing on the merits. I just think you're ignorant and like AOC, can't have anyone calling you out on it.
Lol OK, whatever you say.
[removed]
[removed]
lol ok
The entire thrust of this comment chain, and this post, is that AOC is not investing in BTC because she doesn't want to be biased towards BTC.

You said ""If AOC had just as much of her value in crypto on a wallet as USD on a bank, she would be unbiased."" But that makes zero sense, because of what I wrote above. Legislation she might support / oppose and public positions she might take would never impact her bank account balance, but they definitely could impact her BTC holdings.

When you're talking about being biased towards your personal wealth, investing in BTC is not the same as depositing money in a bank, or the same as investing in a bank's equity. Having money **deposited** (not invested) in a bank account doesn't have any impact on one's political positions.

I'm sorry, but your analogies here don't make sense. The pebble analogy from earlier was just bananas.

I can not find the video with AOC and Bernie miscalculated APR. It was related to their proposal to cap rates at 15% which I agree with but then during the video they show their math and their numbers are all wrong. I posted full interviews so you can not claim I am taking e eating out of context.

and now it's time for the gaslighting. classic.

Well, yeah. Whatever I say here is literally what's happening. You choosing to believe blatant propaganda is on you.
I made it very clear and comprehensible why depositing money in a bank is investing. That's all I can do, the rest is on you. Sapere aude.
I just watched the first video that's ~seven minutes long. You're saying it's stupid of her to say (that's the lie?) they should not give the subsidies, instead spend that $3 Billion directly - because they were going to be subsidies and weren't ""money in the bank"" as it sounds like she's saying, I take it? 

Sure, yeah, that's a bit silly. I don't think she necessarily meant that precisely, but, nevertheless, it still stands that these behemoth corporations are always getting subsidies, looking for the best deals, generally spoken about so positively by the media complexes and financial channels, and there's never more talk around the systemic issues around corporations' influence on the political structure, poor treatment of labor (historically and contemporarily) and their ongoing destruction of unions. 

Why didn't Amazon come back to the table and renegotiate? Why is it always the fault of the non-corporate entity? 

As for the second video, that's ~27 minutes long and, as I said before, I don't have the time to find whatever you're talking about. The burden is on you. 

As for the APY thing. Ok, there's a good chance you're right, but I'm skeptical as I see no proof. Furthermore, did they address and take responsibility for being, supposedly, wrong about any of this - did you look for that, by chance? 

To compare them to Trumpers and say they're *the same* is intellectually dishonest at the end of the day and I don't think I need to explain why.
Looked through my post history to discredit... mentioned centrism... can't stop going back to the same strawman about site demographics... used the word ""triggered"", reduced yourself to childish insults for the free space... hey everybody I got alt right bingo!!!

Have a nice day, try not to get canceled by the shadows on the wall. I've heard it's impossible to say anything on the internet these days, lots of people on the internet have told me.

Lmao.
lol, ask any financial advisor if money in a 0% APY checking account is ""invested"". Go on, try it and report back!

sapere aude indeed lol
1. She lied saying that the money could have been invested into the community. The money didn't exist yet. You might be ok with her lying and you already have defended her saying well she didn't mean what she said. 
2. If you do not know the difference between a large multinational corporation and an elected representative then I can not help you there. They went to Norfolk instead

3. I will drop the APR thing because I can not for the life of me find the full video. I believe it was a Bernie Sanders campaign video but at this point who knows I could have dreamed it.

I think a lie is a lie full stop. Just because some lies might be for the greater good doesn't make then any less of a lie. In your first section you went to bat for her lie saying she meant something else and that is the same response I get when I make fun of people saying trump recommended people inject bleach ""well clearly he meant something else"". Just because you are ok with intellectually dishonestly doesn't mean everyone else is

Edit: also in the 27 min video the part I am referring to starts at around 5:50
i mean, i was. but then i snapped out of it after Obama was elected and immediately did a 180 upon his inauguration and refused to hold Bush accountable for his warrantless wiretapping - a promise he made on the campaign trail.

now i'm fully awake.
[removed]
Again. Just look at the definition of ""investing"".
The qualifier related to her ""silliness"" (as I admitted) was ""nevertheless."" I admitted that's silly and, perhaps she didn't ""precisely"" mean that... ""nevertheless"" (as in, ""aside from that even if it's totally true, I concede"" - as per the dictionary: nonetheless; notwithstanding; however; in spite of that:) this goes to speak to the unequal treatment by the larger media complex around corporations (lack of) social investment and why the wealthiest company in history (or close to it) even needs subsidies. This is made all the more salient by the fact that Amazon did, *in fact,* end up setting up shop in New York *without* the subsidies. 

Anyway, if that's truly what she meant then that's pretty dumb, I agree, totally. Though, if it were truly a mistake, then it *wouldn't* have been a lie. If she did say that purposefully while knowing that's not how it works, then that'd be a lie - and she should be taken to task over that, I agree, 100%. So, do you know if it was on purpose or not?  

I speak to the issue of representatives and corporations because they're given unequal treatment. The larger media apparatuses are rarely ever as critical of corporations *outright lying* and their outsized destruction of society and environs as they are about politicians. You're doing it here yourself, in some respects. The lies, half-truths, and propagandizing corporations tell/do, such as Amazon, are (generally) far more destructive and damaging to us and everyone than most other lies by individuals. That's not to say one or the other should be condoned, though.  

As for the 27 minute video, I have watched were you said (at about 5:50) and don't see/hear what you're referring about being a lie. She's saying that the numbers related around unemployment are often inflated due to gig-jobs, part-time jobs, and people who are working two jobs - working 60, 70, and 80+ hours a week. Which is, largely, totally true and very problematic.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Employment numbers are not inflated by people working multiple jobs that is an outright lie. That is not how any of this works. You said a 100% false statement is ""totally true and very problematic"".
why would I lie about that? I've literally always hated neocons.

does this break your fragile worldview or something where everything is black and white and everyone fits into neat little boxes?

now this is irony.
[removed]
From what I understand and have read it's not anywhere near as cut and dry and clear and easy and simple and straightforward as you're making it out to be. Not even close. So, are you lying then? Is that what you're doing? Are you being a liar? Huh? 

>The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas ‚Äî one of 12 regional reserve banks that make up the centralized Fed ‚Äî found that although unemployment is low, wage growth has not increased. One reason could be the rise of gig workers: The report found that the number of workers who pay self-employment taxes has risen steadily over the past 35 years.

>... The fact that worker wage growth has not increased at the pace of the economy is a cause for concern, according to a recent report from the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates. While unemployment nears five-decade lows, the number of gig-economy workers has increased over the past five years...

^[(source)](https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-lyft-drivers-gig-economy-unemployment-numbers-2019-4?op=1)

So the main issue, that even though there's low unemployment numbers, means fuck all for anyone but the richest of the rich. 

Then compound all that with this, 

>According to the BLS, the number of people holding down multiple jobs has dropped since the mid-1990s and is now at 4.9%. That suggests the number of people holding multiple jobs is limited. But there are reasons to question the data.
>* Potential sampling issues
>* People may not realize they work multiple jobs
>* People may not admit to multiple jobs

More.. 

>Analyzing another dataset illustrates how difficult it is to nail down the number of gig workers in the United States. The problem begins with defining them.

>""No clear consensus currently exists on what constitutes gig work,"" said Mary Allard, a division chief in the BLS Office of Employment and Unemployment Statistics in Washington, D.C. ""Most definitions include many self-employed workers, temporary workers and independent contractors. Many definitions also include people who do gig work as their primary source of income, as well as employed people who supplement their earnings with gig work.""

I would think any single year of education even remotely fucking covering economics would clue you in on the fact that federal, novel economic policies have very long lasting effects
How am I lying? Just please give me one example you bring up metrics from things we are not even discussing. I claim AOC lies saying people working multiple jobs are the reason for low unemployment when there is not a single unemployment metric that counts people more than once regardless of how many jobs they work. Why are you changing the topic? Please just give me an example of one lie? You double down on lies multiple times now and avoid the topic."
