Title	Score	URL	Comments	It's crazy that I almost thought about monetizing this, rather than giving it for free. It's time to realize and the real flaw of money--it makes people selfish. I want to end that and make people care about each other again. Here is my year long TradingView project, for free. I keep the code tho :)	601	https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/lxd6d5/its_crazy_that_i_almost_thought_about_monetizing/	"Throw some ads on the page and we'll be happy to click them for you!!
I haven’t really checked out the indi yet, but man I like your style.  

I can help with your website, maybe convert to TOS, idk other stuff too probably.  Feel free to pm  if you need anything.  You rock.

OMG I love to know that people like you, unselfish and caring for the little people are here and willing to help others with nothing in return than the satisfaction of helping. Thank you so much!👌🙏🙏
I used this today and had great success with entering trades. Much appreciated!
Been using it all week - pretty great!
anyway to do this in TOS?
you got a twitter or something? I am willing to follow I would love to see a youtube video. I am brand new too this (Only like 4 months in total but using a real broker, Thinkorswim, I am brand new this will be really helpful!) Thank you
Straight up gentleman. Net positive in this world🤌🏻

Hey man appreciate what you’re doing!
I’ve downloaded it & am trying to figure it out now. Honestly, I’m probably too dumb & new to trading to figure out how to use it, or utilize it anywhere near it’s capabilities.
Thank you for developing it & not charging for it. Very cool!
I think I used the prediction charts right & it’s prediction is right where I was estimating. 
So, anyway, thanks!! 🙏🏽
Very cool. Thank you
I mean you are monetizing it though- nothing wrong with that I mean it’s hard work and you probably should- but if you go to your website you’ve got all sorts of paid products....
Thanks so much for sharing this.
thx dude !
Will this work for swing trade entry & exit as well? If so, how would the settings need to be adjusted?
what does gray bar mean? momentum accumulating?
Hi! Thanks for sharing, can you explain a little more on how to tune the settings? cant see the code so i can not know what changes are the different values doing :)
Thanks for sharing a you tube series would be great. What is your website??
I would be very interested in a YouTube series. Are you planning on doing some beginner-friendly material or just more advanced stuff? I'm a new trader and having a hard time finding good resources to learn more that aren't packed full of words and concepts that I don't understand.
cool! thanks will be back testing this on SPY! id love to see whatever youtube series you make.
I am still not very sure how to use the information you have shared (disclaimer: never used TradingView before, I am not good with any TA). Are you able to make a YouTube video for us noobs perhaps? Thanks for not being selfish btw, we have enough of those to last us many lifetimes. :)
Thanks
Awesome tool. You're a legend.
Thank you very much for your kind contribution!
Dude I haven't even looked yet which I am going to do but I just want to say bravo and it's refreshing to see this type of mentality in the world.
I’m not experienced with using Trading View. I have a TV account and the app on my phone, but never used it. How do I load this indicator into TV? Thanks a million!
Any video available yet to help us all better understand how to use this?
I LOVE YOU🥺👉🏼❤️👈🏼
When you are done with the tutorial please edit this post I’d love to find anything that could lend an edge to the system.
Any chance you can add a toggle for those of us who are red-green color blind?  The toggle could simply change the color scheme. Thanks for publishing this either way.
Thank you!!, looking forward to YouTube or any other updates!
Seems like a less accurate version of the MACD Histogram no? Why is that last bar green with so much selling pressure?
You sure you don’t want to sell this as an NFT per indicator ? Might mike a few hundred million off it :) 

Thank you though .. this is great work!
How has this changed your profiles liquidity?
How has this changed your profiles liquidity?
Can I get a tv account without signing up and use the indicator? I have too many brokers already😬.
Money doesn't make anyone selfish.
Anyone who believes it does must hate anyone with money or anyone trying to make money. 
Therefore, your unconscious bias against money means it can't possibly work.
Love this thing...I’m going to start backtesting tonight...awesome work!  Anyway to get this for TOS would be great as well.  Looking forward to the YouTube video
How does it work exactly
Allah keep you happy ❤️

I have a Trading View Pro account and tried it and the EMA and ATR or missing. All that's been added is the VSI on bottom and it looks very blurry. Basically my chart looks nothing like yours. What am I doing wrong? 

Thanks for helping people by the way.
I must get 50 emails a day from self proclaimed multimillionaires trying to sell 99.00 books on investing.
Do the indicator give you the sign on when to enter the trade if you buying or selling
Thank you very very much. Greatly appreciate it
Man I might have to add this to my confirmation tools just to see if it supports the trades I would take anyways ... cool stuff!
Please teach how to use this?
Lazy strategy that actually works: go to open insider and look at the latest cluster buys (not insider buys those don’t mean shit for the direction of the stock price) and buy 5 things that the rich people bought on the same day. At least 4 of them will go up. This is a trick I sometimes use and this is not financial advice
Is there a way you can tweak it for long term swing trading? 6 months to year long holds?
I didn’t click on your link yet, but it sounds interesting. I will give it a go. 
I am sure that we can spread that far. I will read and give it a go on german pages. 
👍🏻👍🏻
I fuckin love the fact that you checked your own urge for greed and instead did a solid to your fellow human.

How about 2000 quid
Bravo
Thanks! Much appreciated. I would definitely be interested in your YouTube video. I'll save this post as well.
Sometimes am not getting good trades, am finally realizing that I have almost the same money. I haven’t lost my account because I risk 0.5% and keep that very tight
Awesome stuff.
You should have at the very least provided your cash app for donations. It’s the least we can do for your generosity. This is really nice!
I suck at trading man.. Can I just hook up my Binance API with you & share 50/50 on net profits? 😁🙏
only found this post today, but I look forward to seeing the video about potential uses for the indicator, thank you for what you do
Cannot wait to try playing around with this.  Anyone find the successful tweaks that are spot on?  So just to be clear as I am an idiot.  This is only for Trading View?  Correct?  What is the exact name of it on Trading View?  Sorry for the stupid question.  I'm new. :)
Thank you!!

Is this something that you’ve largely used on currencies/forex etc? Or have you used this on stocks etc as well? Have been using it over the last few days just see what happens and it looks good but wanted to check before I start back testing aka spending hours looking over charts to realise it’s not great for stocks 😂 top work though 👍.
Please do a ToS version!
I have not used it in a strategy yet, as I believe it to be a better complimentary indicator to price action that a standalone, but I could build a strategy out of it if there is demand for it.
Glad to hear it! Be sure to share this tool with others when you get the chance
You said you used it. Did you have to open TradingView (TV) first then come here? I’m kind of lost on how to use this in TV. I primarily use TOS to chart. This post seems so beneficial though.
How do I use this? 

I have been using 9 ema + support/resistance/breakout for entries
Nope
You'd have to code it yourself
You're welcome. Please look forward to the tutorial video for this indicator I will be uploading some time next week!
I dont have a website, yet, but even when I do I probably will have most if not everything free on there.
I would play with the number of days back variable to like 7, 14, 21 or 30. I am not a swing trader myself but I think it would help with giving insight into the buying/selling pressure on any time frame.
Gray bar means no specific momentum is calculated yet. I should note that this should only be used as a confirmation indicator once a candle has closed, it can give some wild reading on a candle that is still open.
Yes I should probably add more descriptive detail to the tunable variables. Basically the ""smoothing period"" is the period of the orange signal line, which is basically just a smoothed moving average of the histogram. You can also increase its amplitude (size) for greater visibility. Number of days past is how many days the indicator looks back (limited to a thousand bars) for the max and min of the volume/volatility combo. Then the current histogram bar is comparing itself to the max, so values above the green dotted line indicate strong buying power and bars below the red line indicates strong selling power.

I also use the default settings in my current system, so I have tinkered too much with them myself.
I do not yet have a website, but it is something I am considering. I will have more details on a YouTube series soon.
Yes my youtube series would be aimed at new and unprofitable traders, focused on building/testing strategies and becoming consistent.
Let me know how it goes! I will make an announcement when my youtube series goes live. Since there has been high demand for me to explain the uses I've found so far with this indicator, I will be putting that up sometime next week.
After you click the link, scroll down until you see a blue button that says add to favorites, then you should be able to put it on your chart by selecting the ""indicators"" tab above the chart area. Hope it helps you like it has me, best of luck!
Still in the works! First time using an animation software but my goal is to have it finished by this weekend, sorry for the wait.
Will do! Sorry that it is taking some time, but patience is a good skill to have in this game anyway haha
Oh of course, I will update that asap.
Okay update is live, and you can now customize the bullish/bearish to any color you like. I appreciate the feedback. Happy trading!
YouTube video is slow going but I am working on it haha. I'll post the link when I get it done
You definitely have to play with the settings for each time frame, but its different from the MACD cuz it is based off of price action (candle structure), volume and volatility.  I recommend using it as a confirmation to other technical analysis. 

I will dive into that more in the video as to why it is sometimes green when there is a lot of selling pressure, but it is basically reading that there is a bullish price action however sellers are in control. This means that buyers are trying to fight back into the sell trend, and based on how tall that green bar is relative to the most recent red (the gray bars on top of the zero line) it could be an indication of a trend reversal, or it could be a pullback in the current trend.
Haha can you imagine having a few hundred million to throw at some garbage like an NFT. Blows my mind
For me it's specifically helped my timing of entries and exits. I don't have any numbers on how much exactly it has benefit me, but my win rate went up and I feel much more confident making trades with this indicator as confirmation. I wanted to get this tool out to help others first, so I haven't actually done any real recorded testing of this tool in isolation, (which is a bit irresponsible), but I have diligently backtested it for my own strategy and found it to be a great tool to time entries and avoid fake outs.
I think you have to sign up to add indicators to your favorites, but it is free.
I would agree with you if there weren't people alive with unfathomable amounts of money (billionaires), while thousands of others in their same nation are starving or homeless.

Money is inherently selfish. It's a necessity for survival, and so we have a very emotional bond with it. It feels satisfying to earn more of it and frustrating when it's spent on something that doesn't directly benefit you or something you care for. 

If you haven't felt it yourself--like when a friend/family member asks for money or when ignoring a beggar on the street corner--you either live a very privileged life or live in denial. 

No I do not hate money, but it is not a flawless system and to pretend so is irresponsible.
Glad to hear it! A Thinkscript version is on my list of things to do, but it will be a minute... as with the YouTube video--First time animating so it's slow going lol but I will see it through I promise
It takes into account price action, volume, and volatility, and then compares the current bar to the maximum over N days ago. This gives us a relative view into each bars ""actual strength"" so to speak.

The green bars mean the bulls won the bar.
The red bars mean the bears won.

The line is a smoothed average, which gives insight into whether the buyers are in control or the sellers.

The color of the line is determined by its momentum, so green is bullish and red is bearish.
Hmm that's really strange, but I've had one other report of it showing up blurry as well. Have you tried messing with any of the settings?
You will have to backtest it to see it how it fits into your strategy. I use it for confirmation on entries. Strong green bars typically mean strong buy volume and strong red bars typically mean strong sell volume. The signal line shows whether buyers are in control or sellers; the color of the line shows the current momentum of the signal line (red is sellers gaining strength, green is buyers gaining strength).
Is open insider a website?
Can you ELI5 this?
I'm sure playing around with the *Number of Days Back* (N) would let you go as far as 365 days or longer depending on the time frame, as I believe it maxes out around 1000 bars back. I haven't tested it myself as the highest time frame I use is the daily, and I normally use <=14 as my N.
Nah 200 racks or no deal
How do I make sure you pay your half tho? Haha
Click the link I provided and then click the blue ""Add to favorites"" button. I just added an update that makes it much easier to use for new traders, but as to the tweaks... well you will just have to put in some work and figure that out. It's gonna be different for each strategy
I trade stocks, crypto, and forex and it has been working well for me on all. 

Could probably use it as the main entry signal but I've only used it as confirmation for my current entry and exit strategies.
Have you released the vid yet ?
What’s your channel?
I added it to my “favorite” indicators. Then when you go to charts it shows up as an indicator you can add in.
Have you posted the vid yet?
oh I see tradingView is not yours? my mistake
Sounds perfect for me. Please update back here once you get that going!
Does it work with the TV app, or only the site?
Don’t be sorry, I’m just excited to start using the tool
For sure.
Interesting! Impressive work. I’ll have to check out your vid when it’s ready.
You should try tracking it statistically speaking and see the loss vs won ratio then base a hypothesis off of the data. It would be interesting to see the results.
The more I give away the more I make (karma)?
Yes ToS is a very popular platform.  I'd be glad to check it out on there.
Didn't realize I missed this. I tried opening a new chart, I unfavored it then re-favorited it and nothing seems to work.

You don't happen to use TOS and if so make a script for TOS people to try?
Thanks a ton friend. Still waiting for your youtube channel. Dont go so high on quality, just it throw it down. Starting is important.
Yes, sorry should have clarified, even if the chart looks sketchy most of the big purchased stocks go up everytime. Fucking rich people must have inside info or just have a sixth sense
That’s easy, just trust a greedy human .. 😂
You have nothing to loose anyway.. 😁
Awesome!!
Thanks for the reply. I’ll keep testing 👍
No video coming any time soon, but I did update the indicator with a simple mode that gives entry signals and makes it much easier to use
I will release another post or update this one with the link, currently working on a tutorial for this indicator, and I will kick off my channel with that video.
Not yet, it is in progress tho; should be ready soon. I had to learn how to use the program as I decided I wanted to animate it (never animated anything before), so it took a bit longer than expected.
u seriously thought TV was his site? yey!
Works on both, but you have to favorite it first on the website
I'm taking a prop firm evaluation right now and my strategy is really basic and based off this indicator; I'm planning on posting the results and doing some basic analysis on the outcomes of my trades. I might even give away my strategy
I actually have a Thinkscript planned for this indicator, but it might be a while before I get to it since I have other projects with higher priority atm.
Sorry been focusing on passing my prop firm evaluation, and then I will be turning my full attention to youtube to help others
>Fucking rich people must have inside info or just have a sixth sense

The game is definitely rigged in their favor. They have connections (insider info) and the amount of volume they trade with actually influences the market. They literally move it up or down by choice, pretty fucking rigged man.
Will you have a tutorial on how to apply/use this with tos? Would love to try this out. It seems like a useful tool to finally be profitable consistently. Thanks.
I mean what the fuck do I know
Sounds good. Best of luck in your projects, its nice your trying to help people.
Okay 🙂
Sorry I have been slacking on the video. I am currently preparing to take a prop firm examination, and for some reason I thought I would have time to do both lol. After I pass the eval I will be making trading education my new focus. That said, I'm sure if you backtest the VSI on a couple instruments you will immediately find how it can compliment good entry points. Best of luck!
Don’t try to change the subject. 

Right now we’re only focused on what you don’t know.
Up there you know he’s monetizing it. Down here not so much.
Good luck on the examination. No rush at all on making the video. The market will always be there. Just happy to have this resource and excited to learn."	Author	Date

It looks worse if you look at it in terms of percentages.  Historically, zombie companies are at about 1 to 3% (as you would expect).  They're over 20% now. Over. 20. Percent.

No one wants to yell ""Fire"" in a theater, but how much smoke do you have to see first?
That escalated quickly 
Wow
This is not just in the US. Interest rates are kept low all across the world by central bankers. They are deliberately keeping all the zombie corporations alive with cheap money. Though on the surface it looks like the central banks are saving ""jobs"" for mainstreet but underneath, they are literally bailing out the wallstreet at the cost of everyone else.

One more thing, Elon Musk is now the 2nd richest person in the world. Fucking crazy times we live in, a single man gaining so much wealth in a global recession. It is like they are not even hiding that central bankers are printing money for the oligarchs.
Shits gonna hit the fan in a couple of years
I feel confident the powers that be will do a ""beautiful deleveraging"" as Dalio likes to call it, AKA inflate it away. 

Otherwise at this pace of Zombification the economy will have as much dead weight as the USSR
With yields pinned to the floor it should be exceptionally easy for income to cover interest expenses.

What would the percentage of zombies be if yields rose a bit?
feel like we are overdue
I think hyperinflation has already been a thing since about 2016 or so - following a deflation event in 2015.  In my area \*mean\* house prices have gone up 100K (!).  Top 20 metros are outta sight now unless you're in that 15% or so of the populace who still have disposable income.
interestingly the inflation is all concentrated in some sectors but not in others.

Most of the housing price inflation was purely from laws that limit housing production combined with low interest rates, 

up until the covid era when actual lumber prices and other input prices shot up almost 200%. Recent lumber price increases alone add another $17,000 material costs to average new house price.

we are seeing more ""cost push"" added to the ""demand pull"" housing inflation."

Thanks for sharing this. Very educational for beginner day traders!

Pls accept a helpful award.
How do you explain a day like today?

Everything is against its week's long trend. And will just revert back to trend...again. Making these kind of yo-yo days.

And I can't seem to find news that explains the behavior, unless half the market trades on yesterday's news versus the other half trading on today's.....
this is cool.
i love chart porn.  it always one day behind.  i need tuesday’s news on monday!

this is useless “trading education” because you only what day you had at eod, 4pm.  how can take this information and trade the next day?!
thank you for the gesture. much appreciated :)
this is a veery valid point. And it baffled me, too. I am open to suggestions. Feel free to share your thoughts in case you figure this out
I guess ou missed the point of 'education'. this is not a prediction. it is a guiding principle to allow traders to gauge the type of the trading day. As with all Technical analysis, smart money determines the direction of price.
Well the best I can come up with is that the market is a few large groups of constituents like a parliament.

Sometimes small parties align to form a coalition governemnt.

Other times they don't align.

If we use that analogy then the big-monied interests are probably their own coalition, and the others are the loyal opposition. That being the case, I'd start to look for reasons why the institutionalists behave the ways the do, which sometimes they seem to ""pull back"" and it makes the government look like the minority is now the majority. And the policies (price action) starts to behave as if they are in control.

But really the intuitionalists just stepped out a moment.

I think the Earnings and Fed Chatter largely did that....so the stocks reverted to how the noobies and lesser-monied people trade. And how the contrarians trade, people who expect opposites to occur and trade with those opposites.

The market isn't full of ldiots when institutions pull out, it's just full of more ldiots once they do.

That's my theory anyway.
much appreciated insights :)"

You are willing to pay market value.  They double down on their short positions borrowing money right now.  IT is very expensive for them right now,  but they go broke settling here.  EVERY Market cycle a few of these guys blow it. LEHMAN BROS in the late 90s and ENRON.  IT IS VERY common. Borrowing at 1% rates make it easy to run markets up...  NOW they face margin calls and charges for the shorts.  CNBC blames you as they  very well know who  the players are the same Citadel, Muddy Waters, Carson block that ran shorts and hit pieces years back. The same ZERO HEDGE site that ran the hit pieces now tries to be your friend and stealing you blind.  85% of all stocks are in very wealthy peoples hands.  THE GOP and HEDGE funds won't tell you they destroyed all regulations that used to make this levorages, tricks, slime ilegal.

Short sellers betting against Tesla lose more than $1 billion in single day as stock surges	1911.0	https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/shorts-betting-against-tesla-lose-more-than-1point4-billion-in-single-day.html?&qsearchterm=short%20sellers	"> Investors betting against Elon Musk’s electric-auto maker Tesla collectively lost an estimated $1 billion-plus on Thursday as the company’s stock headed for its best day on Wall Street since 2013.

> Tesla popped 16.5% Thursday to around $300 per share, meaning short sellers betting against the stock are on track for $1.4 billion in mark-to-market losses on the day — wiping out almost 70% of short sellers’ year-to-date profits, estimates S3 Analytics.

> To be sure, those who bet against Tesla at the start of 2019 are still in the black to date with the equity down more than 11% this year after Thursday’s price moves. Tesla stock closed at $254.68 on Wednesday, which at the time represented a 23.4% slide for 2019

> Tesla is the most heavily shorted stock in the U.S., as well as the most heavily shorted automaker in the world. Short interest, or the number of shares borrowed in hopes of buying them back at a profit after the stock drops, totals $9.03 billion for Tesla, according to S3

Edit: To those of you who can't tell, this is a joke.
Well done to him, honestly.

&#x200B;

There is a line between a fraudulent charlatan and a prophetic visionary - a vague one, but definitely there. Musk is the latter. Even if Tesla fails in the long term, he has single-handledly changed the paradigm of the automobile industry to that of electric vehicles and greater energy renewability.

&#x200B;

And likewise, there is a line between a rational skeptic and a niggling bien-pensant of an idiot - again, a vague one, but definitely there. Musk's critics are proving themselves to be the latter.

It was crazy watching it shoot up afterhours... That doesn't happen too often.  I almost feel  bad for the bears... Almost.
Any piece of good news is never as good as the market reaction indicates in a highly shorted stock. But maybe Tesla will be able to meet the market's expectations from their Chinese production that is coming online.
And the show continues today ! Another 300 mil

This is the stupidest this subreddit has ever been. Good Lord.

Pretty sure my finance professor owns some TSLA because in class he was going on and on about Musk listening to the finance guys and proving a bunch of shorters wrong.
Looks like everyone who bet against Elon came up short
You don't bet against the sun god. 

I don't follow the stock but just a quick scan of the balance sheet and cash flow statements shows a fairly healthy solvency and liquidity position and a ton of non cash charges. DA almost covers the entire loss. They paid 3.7 B in debt and still ended up with an increase in cash. 

Not a lot to hate.

Do you study investing before deciding where to invest? How? Let's share.
So, these are long term short sellers?  People that shorted weeks or months ago expecting a long term decline rather than people that shorted this morning.
Most heavily shorted stock in the US and we wonder why we always see so much negative press around Elon and the company right before it goes up...

Nah even wallstreetbets know not to screw with Tesla's volatile stocks
Yep. That Herbalife guy learned the same lesson the hard way, and he was targeting a business that was 1000% sleazier than an electric carmaker. Tesla at least makes a product that people want.
Yes it's even worse when the cult is delivering on really hard shit, the cult has been learning how not to sound like crazy maniacs, the world needs them to deliver and they have access to pretty much unlimited capital
Why is it a cult? I’ve driven two of the cars myself and really enjoyed it. I could see myself driving one in a few years once I’m more financially stable. 

I guess I dont understand where the cult part comes in?
Prophetic visionary? That seems a bit much. 

One thing I like about him is that while he’s human and does stupid shit like getting into a twitter-beef with a veteran, at the end of the day he really does try to do good.
From making Tesla’s electric designs available to other car companies, to helping schools in Flint have clean water, he just steps up and tries to move humanity forward even though it won’t benefit him personally as much as being another shitty billionaire would.
'prophetic visionary'

lol ok joe rogan

Also the critics are not full idiots. They have great reasons to criticize tesla based on the production issues, barely managing to make a profit after all this time, and the decision making of its CEO. 
They're partial idiots because they don't take into account the bigger idiots who hype up Tesla and Musk despite all these criticisms. A smart trader factors in the irrationability of the market and unquantifiable things such as cult following.
It wouldn't be so bad if the short selling didn't involve viral marketing about how overvalued Tesla is.
Elon certainly deservse it, but anyone holding Tesla stock doesn't.  It's nice to see these guys liquidated.
TFN: Trust for financial companies, CRM for business and Insight I've seen this while researching financial information.
Pretty sure they’re using prior month data which comes from NASDAQ.

Since they’re an analytics firm, they very likely may be making adjustments to the data...but the only “official” info about short interest is from the prior month.
What are you suggesting?
Have we gotten so down on the hate that we are calling a quarterly report a *circlejerk now*? 

Also please don't spend millions on a PDF, I'll do it for 10k, man, same quality guaranteed
Is this a whoosh?

You’re saying they spent millions on a blurb to answer questions when the media come knocking?
Smart. People see them as innovators. I highly doubt they want to start pushing ads onto Hulu just yet...there isnt enough supply
[deleted]
It cannot go tits up
because based on the actual stats of the company, the stock is overvalued like a motherfucker. they just recently made their first ever profit in any quarter yet they were huge way before that because of hype. They have a ton of production problems and no rational trader would buy their stock at price if just looking at the fundamentals. But most people aren't rational and this affects the market. There is so much hype around the cars and personality cult around Musk, that that fact alone causes the prices to be so high. Thats why when trading, you also have to factor in public psychology, not just the facts of the company.
The cult is more about Musk than Tesla. People on the internet, especially in places like /r/dankmemes, /r/pewdiepiesubmissions, /r/space, etc. talk about him like he's singlehandedly saving the world. He's even got multiple subreddits dedicated to just him. 

My personal opinion is that Tesla's aren't bad cars by any means, but they do have some production issues and, given the uncertainty of Tesla's long term outlook, I don't know if I'd trust their warranty to be available when I want it.
Yes, prophetic visionary. I know what I said and I stand by it.

Musk transformed a 100 year old industry while running a space exploration company, all with the goal of increasing the survival odds of the human race. This requires more than just good intentions and competence.

Love him or hate him, and I did hear that Musk can be deeply unpleasant, but the man is a giant of history. And the short-sellers deriding Tesla for its (admittedly very true) gaps in the principles of reasonable valuation - well, they may make money, but greatness will elude their grasps.
See my comment above.
If you can get everyone to bet against something that’s a sure thing then you can make good money.  This happens with tesla often and people always get rekt

This is not Tesla’s first profitable quarter.  It is the third one but not in a row.
Shorts up ytd.
yeah but the elon musk fantasy is gonna die out at some point.
Correction, never underestimate their willingness to give bad advice to shift the markets while they make more rational bets themselves
TSLA is up 6.2% ytd...

If everyone there is just shit posting to con other users into making bad bets, does it really have any effect on the markets?

This hurts as hell, seeing an opportunity but being unable to take it. Believe I've taken advantage and made good use of the dip because I set aside a little from every penny I'm getting to can buy the dip. With this technique I hope I'll be able to buy BXX once it's listed.
My pain is being denied by bank to buy the dip. That’s also another level
Oh a scale of “stagnant for months” or “bought at an ATH”, how much pain do you feel?
I just wanna stake!!!!!
Calling a crash a dip is cope
Oh c’mon man. We’ve been in a “dip” for over three months. You haven’t had any spare change for over three months?

I’m holding cryptos right now but the cognitive dissonance in this sub is awful.
It hurts asf not being able to take an opportunity when it presents itself. Thankfully I took advantage of the dip and accumulated more... Loaded my bag with more PNODE, ADA, ETH and plan to stake all. Particularly gonna stake PNODE the most so I can take full advantage of it's UniFarm pool whereby users who stake PNODE havee the opportunity to yield 5 more tokens

The pain is iristable to the bones! Good thing I've accumulated my fave alts in the dip and their staking program is available now. I'm talking about MEL from Melalie.
I feel attacked!

I am feeling this currently.
Don’t worry it’s still dipping 🥲
I feel attacked, this is so me, especially when I get to see a new project with good fundamentals when they pop up on a user-friendly Launchpad.

It doesn’t hurt so much until someone reminds me it’s supposed to.

Buy high, and sell only a tiny bit higher lots of times.
Idk how to put it in words, but it’s kinda like hot potato... you see how much the stock “vibrates” and where it vibrates ( what price it stays around). If it’s a technical breaking point volume has to come in the last bit to confirm a movement up it down.. careful though cause it can also be a trap... regardless have a,b,c,d, and e scenarios and always be willing to flip your decision. I wouldn’t go so hard on your first entry just in case your wrong. And if you flip your direction I would take a little more risk to make up your loss. And if your quick enough, add more! I would also only try to play support and resistance and not play in between unless your conviction is high ( I  only try to go for 3-4 cents here between 300-700-900 shares, if I’m wrong and it does against me and I have a good feeling it will vibrate around the price I double down to get a better entry ( sometimes my risk to reward messes up but I let my conviction take lead and it works for me). Also don’t try to sell at increments of five cents.. I find that selling between five cent moves is way better. Also just make sure you have a stop loss if you play with size. And if out in and the price moves in your favor raise the stop up to your entry ... sometimes if you had a good entry you won’t get stopped out sometimes you do though.. idk I find that I lose less when I do this.
I usually do the same. If your broker have low spread,  It's an opportunity,  but with  a really slow gain with shitty RR ratio."						
Some colleges are starting to teach courses about crypto and blockchain technology.	107.0	https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/py4pi3/some_colleges_are_starting_to_teach_courses_about/	"This is great. But school should stick to foundational concepts rather than industry latestest and greatest.

Again cool but I'd prefer they taught the theoretical design implications. Similar to how they teach in systems OS what mechanisms are implemented, the design pattern, why and how it has evolved over time. This is better than a structured ""heres how to build"" practical development course. Which sounds more fitting for a crypto dev bootcamp or capstone course which exist.
My school offered 1 class on blockchain this semester. Also, some of my finance courses touch on the crypto market now. My school is also like any other regular public uni at a state school in US. I think in the next few years colleges will start to make crypto/blockchain a major given the market is opening largely to jobs.
You mean MIT?
I think it's great that schools are expanding courses to include crypto and such. Afterall, knowledge is power. It's always better to know things regardless if you decide to put it to use. 

Think about the amount of all the useless courses we had to take in school. At least this decision seems practical and more with the times.

What's your most useless course?
in university or college in USA. i did computer science. the lecturers were useless and so were the classes. after the first year i just taught myself.

these days there is far better information online to learn xyz then paying huge fees for a degree. that said sometimes you need the peice of paper to get a job, that and you do need some learning progression structure.

if you want to learn blockchain do this:

- read mastering bitcoin
- read mastering ethereum
- do a udemy course on eth dev (i have a link to a good one if u want it)
- read read read, plenty of great artciles. 

this is how ive learned about blockchain
It is a waste of time and a way for schools to make money.

We in the crypto space don't have any certificate in crypto or blockchain but we are expert in the space. Most of us are self taught because we practice by trading, making mistakes and changing strategies.
I am currently in the middle of a Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency course at my school. It has been quite educational when it comes to the encryption process and the other basics of what a blockchain is and how Bitcoin specifically implements the blockchain.
In Germany there is the Hochschule Mittweida where you can actually study 'Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies'. It‘s a master’s course and I think you should have a bachelor in normal computer science.
I think education will go a long way towards legitimizing crypto and growing the industry but think honestly Tik Tok and ""Fin influencers"" are driving teens into crypto via NFT by the boatload
Now they can teach you how to use blockchain to make money, while they take it from you for information you can find quicker and more up to date online for free.
My ecommerce business class does a week on blockchain. Teacher did the first lecture in a bitcoin shirt. Apparently he helped work on creating the first internet structures.
They can learn about blockchain online, all resources are here and the space changes so quick it will be hard for colleges to keep up. 

What people really ought to study is economics and learn reading scientific papers so they don't end up reading The Bitcoin Standard and basically become extremised.
BanklessDao's community have an education section and are starting to form a syllabus with a view of colloborating with consensus.  For something more immediate thats noob friendly [https://rabbithole.gg/](https://rabithole.gg) does quests for learning about different topics where you can also earn rewards.  Always found it easier to learn through doing personally.
My college has been doing that for at least 5 years and now all the students and teachers who were into it are loaded
I have seen ads that NUS is offering blockchain and fintech education.
Hope the tech about data security and full control because that is exactly what we need now in this crypto streets.
This is great. I wish it can be taught in schools all over the world the younger ones should be introduced to crypto as it is the future and is changing our lives positively especially crypto projects like the Easyfi Network that aims to provide fast and secure financial lending services for the globe, especially those unbanked in emerging economies.
Very soon educational content would be displayed to passengers while traveling to their destinations through virtual reality, holoride is making sure of that. Adoption level would increases as the metaverse space would be popular also.
Kinda related, if you’re a math major, take mathematical cryptography. It goes through all the mathematical group structures that make encryption even possible at a higher level.
That's exactly what we do at the University I teach.
At my school all we got was foundational knowledge. I think a few more software engineering and classes like this are good to compliment the slough of theoretical classes you have to take.
Have you seen Gary Genslers MIT course?
Id say this is only true for basic or introductory concepts. Good luck being able to teach yourself algebraic geometry or jet propulsion, for example.
Can I have the course on eth dev? Thanks :)
[deleted]
A lot of pure math subjects are very difficut to teach on your own and almost impossible to master on your own.
i dont mean to say university is useless. i think its very subject dependent e.g. you cant become a dr with just wiki. there is alot more than your narrow subject interests of choice, there are also subjects on ethics which are important in medicine.

ditto on the math
It’s completely free on MIT Opencourseware. There is no cash grab. Also the guy teaching it is basically the head policeman for finance. 

What crypto firm do you work at?

Yeah I get what you're saying from a money perspective.  I'm conflicted about what to tell my future children about higher education.  I think the majority of the benefit comes from exposure to different types of people and ideas that come with moving away for college, but the amount of money required for tuition is insane.
STEM degrees are usually worth it, stuff like humanities / sociology etc, read a book. i was curious about sociology. so i read the first year book i got off a mate. i saved $600 on the course at the time and learned just the same."

Is it just me or does everything related to the “economy” end up punishing the working poor?	92.0	https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/10/28/used-car-prices-chip-shortage/	"Money printing punishes the working poor, which everyone supports without voicing support, even the working poor.

You either have money printing(theft) or you have collapse. This is how the system is designed.

If you don't like it, well, we can discuss another *economy*... something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYkdEU_B4o) for example.

Edit: for anyone claiming this is 'capitalism's' fault I ask, where in the definition of capitalism is money printing found? This is a bastardized version of capitalism, adopted globally, called *American Capitalism*. The United States *temporarily decoupled the us dollar from precious metals* in '71. This was the beginning of the end of the dollar and the beginning for the globalist takeover of the entire world.

In order for the zero-sum gambling economy to work, there must be a coordinated attack on wages. Why? Nominal gambling debts require the money supply to increase. To prevent a total hyperinflation, labor costs have to be controlled.  


When economists talk about ‘inflation’ it never means rich people assets which can inflate double digits forever, they mean poor people assets which is labor.
By design I believe
Certainly you don’t expect politicians or their wealthy donor friends to be ‘punished’ do you.
You get what you vote for… suck it up buttercup…if you believe in more government control, the poor are only going to suffer more…
The poor will always be punished because they don't have the resources to weather an economic storm. The old saying is true, it's expensive to be poor. Everything economic related is an issue if you don't money.
Yes its deliberate!  They make the rules!  They show us a carrot but we are actually getting entraped.
I particularly love the FED chair saving we have to hold wages steady.  At rates far below levels one can live.  It is bizarre to listen to him.
Globalization even in the infancy of capitalism was something Marx pointed to as a bastardization of international solidarity. Not to mention he predicted the outcomes of capitalism such as instability and collapse of modern society. Value today is determined by scarcity and demand both of which are manipulated by capitalists. These are systemic issues which define capitalism existed early on and created the early labor movement. Recently again as regulations and wages stagnant has it created another push for change. 
(For the definition of capitalism it is the private ownership of the forces of production, with markets being an agreed upon medium of exchange. Without a medium of exchange whether it’s agreed upon value or currency private property becomes difficult to value. Which is why medieval communes dominated briefly under feudalism when the empire of Rome collapsed.)
Globalization and complacency, per usual, has fucked us all.

What next?
Yeah capitalism has fucked us, I’d recommend a cure for capitalism by Dr. Richard Wolff. He’s a market socialist and I think he provides the most pragmatic and realistic alternative.
I've followed Richard wolffe fairly closely over the last few years. I really like a lot of what he has to say.

Having said that, if you think he is the answer, we're all truly fucked
.
No I think revolution is needed I just refer to his blueprint for a more egalitarian society.
His version of society also requires force. Humans have tried organizing via force for ten thousand years+. Maybe it's time to try something different?
Such as? Political power is derived from the barrel of a gun or tip of a sword
How about peace? Recognizing that the initiation of force is immoral and undesirable. Ostracize or kill those that do initiate force. 

Also this: https://youtu.be/jTYkdEU_B4o
Peace? You realize that the peace movement largely failed and was violently suppressed you can’t just will meaningful changes into existence you have to put blood and sweat into something for it to change especially a matter so vast. Revolution against oppressive forces is never an unjust form of violence so long as it’s in self defense.
> You realize that the peace movement largely failed and was violently suppressed you can’t just will meaningful changes into existence

You ignored most of what I said. Would you define the initiation of force for me?

> Revolution against oppressive forces is never an unjust form of violence so long as it’s in self defense.

Did I say it was? Please stop having conversations in your own head and stay on topic.
“Behavior which uses force to get what a party wants” you’re saying that revolution would be immoral because it uses intimidation against capitalists right?
You're assuming I'm interested in a revolution. They're tired, old. Fuck a revolution.

Give me secession. 

> “Behavior which uses force to get what a party wants”

What is this?

> you’re saying that revolution would be immoral because it uses intimidation against capitalists right?

No.
Intimidation of force that is the definition

Today I made my first $70 bucks from the market, & promptly logged the fuck off.	3191.0	https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/lvon5a/today_i_made_my_first_70_bucks_from_the_market/	"No thats awesome. Congrats. Keep it up and keep your head in the game and never get emotional, only analytical. Your future will be bright. Seems not so long ago my daily benchmark was $100 unrealized gain. I logged $7k in realized gain today. There will be growing pains and losses but if your truly invested (pun intended) you will succeed!
If I only knew you were allowed to stop after that first win...
Just remember the process should drive happiness not the result.
I made $1k today but in the last 5 days, if I add it up, I made zero.
That’s $17,500 annualized! Great job!
Congrats brother.....I am just starting myself. It's been an exciting 4 months! SOOO much to learn.
Knowing when to take your profits is just as important as knowing when to cut your losses. Once you hit your targets, take them and get out. Don't get greedy.
Congrats bro! Stay disciplined like that. $50 every trading day for the year is $12k. My goal is always $50 at a minimum. I trade options, and have long positions. But I shoot for at least $50 in scalps. I made $675 last week, which is almost 3 weeks worth of goals, got greedy and lost $291 on TSLA options. It was green for a few min, but went red, and I doubled down, then quadrupled down lol. Stay disciplined bro
This is the way. 

The learning curve is a long bumpy one, but very rewarding. Keep it up!
congrats! I started an account with $500 in it almost a month ago and I'm at close to $900 already. 
at this rate, I should be a billionair within 6 months... assuming my math is correct
You should get a trading psychology book. I recommend the daily trading coach. You WILL lose money at times, especially starting out. It will likely take at least a year before you can find consistent profitability. Don’t get too high or too low.
$70 is just the start! Keep at it and you'll see more and more zeros added on ;)
I am also very new, green and ignorant as to the finer points.  
I started in November,promptly lost $3,000 backed off, went in with small positions and as of today I have made my losses back and I'm a little bit ahead.   
It takes a lot of dedication, discipline, emotion control and the ability to admit your mistakes and to learn from them to be successful. I still have a long way to go.  
Thank-You for your post!  
It's great to know that there are a number of novices going through this.  
Wishing you great success in 2021.
I don’t want to be a downer but today with the market being up over 2% the odds were definitely in your favour. Congrats on the first win but be careful!
Great job! Now I’m saying this purely out of love... get ready for the market to eventually pull your pants down and take you to funky town. Doesn’t mean you are overall going to lose... but you will 100% lose some profit at one point or another.
That is great! Keep reading and keep sane with your trades. But also keep reading. And watching Youtube videos from qualified people.
This is amazing! I can totally relate. Discovering my passion for day trading turned my life around too...from feeling like I had no purpose or direction to feeling excited to wake up every day. I am so happy for you!!!!
Congrats and fuck you.
Attaboy. Did you start because of all the GameStop hype?
Congrats bro, now do it 20 times ...
You will come back for more. There is no escape. You will be hooked
This is my exact story. Thanks and keep on keepin, on.
You are not alone.
Congrats. I remember when I made my first few wins. Amazing feeling.
Made over $27k today (69 trades)
Stick with it and remember that a win is a win
Be careful and conservative and learn. Read read read. I have been trading for years and am not a professional by any means but I have grown my little tiny day trading account from a few hundred dollars to 30k+ and my long term investment accounts into the low six figures. This took time and patience. I made some mistakes here and there but also made some great plays and gains in other areas. Just make sure you know what you can risk on each trade and make sure you trade with money you don't need. I started with my dividends from my stock from the company I worked for. It was 60$ a quarter and that was enough to start. Find your strategy and stick with it. I like to sell at a particular profit point and move half to another stock and rinse and repeat. I leave some gains on the table but I average up and have few true losses. Many of us here started in the 20, 30 or 100 dollars in a day and it takes time to increase those gains. I cannot stress enough the learning and reading aspect. Lastly congrats bro! Welcome to the fun! :)
Congrats man, after loosing $5 over the course of my two week investing career, I made $2 today and i am estatic!
Yeah I’d be careful as f with this, sounds like a recipe for disaster for your mental health
Awesome 👍🏼 I know how you feel I made three day trades normally I’m a long position individual. But lost $70 first trade. Made $780 second trade and made a $1.80 on third trade 🤣 I accidentally messed up my sell limit order
I started about a monthish ago... time flies when all the days are basically the same...

I made 300 one day, lost 500 the next, made 50 bucks the next, etc.

It's been a rollercoaster.

The thing is, no matter how low the stocks I have drop, I had the faith to purchase them to start with, did the DD on most of them...hey, I'm new, so sometimes, you get talked into buying T&A stock, because who doesn't like boobies...then you go to their website the next day, and find the owner talking smack about little guys like you buying their stock, and basically cutting their own throats.

The point is, a stock had value to you, at a time. So, don't panic sell. Most will tell you to set a stop loss strategy, and I say that's a smart play. Me, I go balls in, and like Michael Jackson sang...I don't stop till I get my nut... oh wait...that's not how the song goes. But anyway, I toss a 100 or two at a stock, and see where it goes. I'm not rich by any stretch of the imagination, and used my stimulus money to get started. I wasn't afraid to cash out, when I got a stock, like DPLS that went up 300%, and then I reinvested that ""house money"" into other stocks. Some did well... some are laughing at me with their dying breath...freaking Lingerie Wrestling Stocks, I'm looking at you...

Just do you.

Never play with more money than you are willing to lose.

If you take a loss, think about the gains you made, not the losses.

Just like in Bangkok, never be afraid to pull out if something doesn't feel right.
That's how it's done.
You are smarter that I am.
What resources did you use to learn?
Congrats, that takes great discipline. Those small gains really add up over time.
Congrats Friend! Things will always get better. Knocked down but never knocked out. Keep grinding.
I try not lose anything I am uncomfortable losing...so if I do see red all day it’s not that big a deal. Congrats and keep it up ....we are all helping each other out in the long run!
Congrats! wish you all the best on this wonderful journey.

Always use percentage!

As a new day trader aswell where did you look to find information
🤣💦 VERY WISE MOVE
Glad you’re stoked, but be wary of relying on your dopamine fix through the stocks.
No jumpy trades you fucking retards!
I love you! now go add zeros to that bank account!!
Congrats. Fair warning, depression and day trading don’t mix well. You gotta stay zen af.
honestly one of the best titles ive seen in a while
How are you gonna feel when you lose $70? I’m just saying don’t base your happiness on your gains because they won’t always be there.
Congrats. Though really, from all the metaphors...""sh**ting into my creal"" is way to graphic!

I made some of my first intentional, live day trades today, and I ended up down a little bit...but I stuck to my plan and that felt weirdly freeing.  There's a lot less stress in a stop loss than anxiously watching and trying to guess the next tick.

The only negative is I was overly optimistic in my exit target and missed out on a gain as a result.  Going to revise my ranges down to focus on even smaller wins and losses as I get more practice.
this got more traction than i thought it would i can’t reply to everyone so i figured i’d add more context for those interested or have questions (other newbies etc). 

today was my first day of live trading i have been doing my job as a sponge and absorbing as much information as i can (doing my best to ignore the noise) which alone was a tedious task. however i figured at some point i’d need to have my trial by fire & decided today was the day to put my knowledge to the test. i have paper traded using both a stop loss & without. as some people have pointed out the market was on an uptrend today & i decided to test my conviction & confidence in my position. i’m currently trading macro futures & my risk is pretty small & i was ready to take my losses to the chin. i just wanted a raw experience as i tend to learn more from mistakes. the market tested my mental fortitude for sure but i believed in the reason why i bought in & held till i was validated. 

for those of you concerned about my mental state & how it might affect me as a day trader, just know that this has become something very positive for me & a source of motivation & drive which is really what i have been searching for. i’m not desperate or just bored i’m respecting the trade. no pun intended 🤙🏽
I make $5k-$10k a day dude
Keep it up man 😎
Just remember - Always set stop loss, and book your losses the same way you book your profits. And keep note of your trades. It gets better over time and will help you identify a pattern of profits/ losses from your trades. 

Congrats on your first profit.
I’m in the exact same boat as you. Only up from here
You'll always remember your first. :) Well done.
Thanks for the post. Same here....you definitely not alone.
Congrats bro! Remember to stay disciplined!
first ones always free
You did better than I did. Currently I'm down $95 because of FOMO and miscalculations. But I'm doing better and I can't wait until I have actual gains because I applied what I have learned. Thanks for the insipiration. Happy trading.
""Promptly logging off"" made me a better day trader.
Congrats, keep going!!
Lost 500 on options today if that makes you feel even better. Congrats. Take profit when you can! Nice to see:)
Congrats, take the market $70 at a time.........set rules, be disciplined
Good luck to you on this new journey. I just started mine today as well on webull. Made a decent $183 return on my first day :) very happy and excited
Everything takes time. This takes way too much research time. But the pay out is worth it. 

Hope to learn a lot from fellow redditers.
I’m in the same situation.  Still learning, so not risking much right now.  Walking away with a small profit does the same for me.  I just figure it as I could have spent the whole day at some crappy job to earn the same amount.  That’s all the motivation I need. Lol
Good job and keep it up!!!
Keep winning, and when you lose, don’t dwell on it too  much.
Logging off is one of the hardest things to do.
What app is everyone using?  I’m tracking a lot of the tickers that come up on penny stocks and a fair percentage aren’t trade-able on Webull.  Should I be using a different broker?
Enjoy this high!
Are you reading books on it? If so which ones? I want to start myself
You smart! Me not! Not shmart at all! Me new too! :)

Made 67 bucks in the morning and decided to learn clicking faster and experience the middle of the day. Stared at the screen learning to use the mouse and got caught on the downhill.
Hey. It’s a good feeling. Enjoy and embrace it.
This is the way
Congrats, but building your ego around daytrading is a dangerous move unless you want to have it completely destroyed fight club style
Congrats 🎉
A winning day is a winning day. Well done!
Aaaand, it’s gone.
Don't log off, hang around if only to observe and learn
70$ is great. Do not ever think bigger that’s my advice
Congrats i had to learn to do that the hardway
Nice job! I’m very proud of you
Come on buddy you are somebody you're making an effort and you realize that life is painful and you're trying and that's more than most people do God dang it hang in there keep chugging away. God bless you God bless America.
That’s fantastic! You never forget your first. Don’t be surprised if you win the first ten times or more in a row. As long as you learn to take the money and run you’ll be ok.
Keep going to the moon 🚀🚀👍
Much love bruv. Wishing you all the best on your new adventure.

Welcome to the cult
I made .01 on my first day.  Your doing a lot better than me.
Good for you
Congrats! I started an account with $130 on it and grew it to $870 in a month. Then got knocked down back to $400+! Remember to not get discouraged winning is awesome and rewarding but take losses as learning experience.
That's awesome broski!   
A win, regardless of the amount, is still a win.  
I've had many instances where I thought I was having a good day by winning hundreds but I got greedy and over-trade and eventually make a huge loss instead. Still learning from this problem!  
Good job my friend!
😂 Realist shit I’ve heard. Reach your numbers and get the fuck out. I’ve been stalking litecoin for about week and I figured out my game plan. I set a buy price point at $165 or lower and sell price of $175. Once I hit my number I’m out. Sunday was a good day to buy crypto low prices everywhere.
What resources did you use/read to start learning how to day trade? Any specific apps?
lOVE YA!!!! R U CEREAL? WE ARE  

## r/DaWallStreetBetsStock COME N SHARE
dont let depression get to you when you have a losing day. Congrats on your win!
WARNING! Wholesome threads on this post!!!
I'm new too, what were some resources you used when you first started?
Congrats!!! I'm right there with ya! Don't let the red bother you so much. Almost not at all. Every penny is a learning lesson and red is a very good teacher!!
Also try to use what I call ""play money"", that twenty bucks I would have spent on a month of cod mobile, my secret chicken nugget addiction, stretch a pack of smokes, it's more fun to me to put it into the market to see what I can do with it now.
 This has become my newest addiction, I watch it like I've got thousands in on it, no shit. If I lost it all now, I'd be out less than a hundred bucks of my own dough plus what I've gained and for the few months I've had of learning so damn much, reading these wild, funny ass subreddits, lurking in these cool communities, the excitement of it all, the money was worth every damn penny.
I wrote down my first deals in great detail: what I felt, how I reacted, why I decided to enter a trade, why I left the trade. How much I got from the trade, what I bought with my first earnings from a month of trading ... So interesting now to read about those emotions! Now there is a completely different sense of trade, more intellectual.
have a daily target everyday and stop once you hit it. once you can hit it consistent, level up. GL
Nice, now please describe for the new people the difference between paper trading and the real thing.
If your emotional or weak minded trading and investment will not work for you
Hey op if you don't mind what was your capital for that 50$ gain? I'm thinking of day trading too. Thanks.
Which is exactly what you should do
That's one strategy. Can build each day for that.
This is something.

You are someone.

Profit is profit. Not letting it get to your head is wise.

1% additional account value per day is about 900% gain per year (assumed 220 trading days per year).
I was completely obsessed when I first started, it was the first thing I thought about when I woke up, most of the day, and as I went to sleep.  It’s a great feeling to have something come along and make you excited about things again.  Welcome and good luck to you
I've done the same LOL
Well done for such positivity. Its become very popular in these pandemic times and is a side hustle in itself. also You can make a little money too, find out about new companies and new industries developing, flying cars, weed, space launches etc. Keep going and remember there will be losses too - Green and red days..
Motivation,  I just started in stocks a month ago...ultimately hope can start day trading and gain some independence from my job..

Your awesome!
Be careful. Nothing will amplify emotions that money. Youll ride the highest highs when you make the right call and your depression will amplify when you fuck up and make the wrong one.
This will be unpopular here but if you were severely depressed I would strongly encourage you not to day trade. You need stability. Day trading is not that
Hey bro! I feel the same way man. When I made like 50 bucks when I first started I was freaking out and it made me feel good. But remember don’t get too addicted to it like gambling. But instead, read as much as you can up onto it. It’s really cool to learn and be confident on what to buy ! Congrats and keep pushing bro! The sun falls and rise again! Aloha
What’s a good amount to start with ?
Can you tell a bit about your methods so far? I’m interested in day trading but I’m just a mood at this point. What was the trade on? How’d you discover the company? How did you conclude that the stock was a good buy?
Grab the small gains!!  They add up!! Cash is king in a volatile market.  Good for you!
Congrats, dealing with depression is difficult and day trading can actually cause extra stress so be mindful and hope you continue to have fun and hodl
/r/gambling
That’s what you want to do!! Good job
Are you actually a brand new *day trader*?  Did you toss 25k into a brand new account not knowing how to trade a lick?  That is a VERY slippery path broski.  Congrats all the same.
Like the great K. Rogers said. ""You got to know when to hold em, know when to fold em, know when to walk away and know when to run.""
dont get discouraged when the market takes that 70 and then some right back
Did you figure taxes?
Good on you I’d have so much more $ if I did this more often
Upstart stock is going to the moon
Buy Kohl (KSS)
First one is free
Congrats! Remember not to get bummed when you lose it. It’s a marathon, not a sprint 😉
YAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSS Congrats biiotch!  Much love to you fam.
Congratulations!  Sometimes I think of it as a puny mortal seeking to pluck a scale from a huge violent dragon.  It does not seek to take my life necessarily, but it most likely will if I am careless.  If I can manage to pluck a bit from it, I call it a win.  Small scale, (sorry), but for my aptitude and abilities at present, it has kept losses to minimum.
I racked up $70 in profit but didn't cash out. 

Excuse me while NIO fucks me dry
Great job!
Start with a small risk because staying in the game long-term and not blowing up your account is like 75% of the trade.
The first of many wins to come. Welcome aboard!
have you had a red day yet  
?   
Market giveth, market taketh
Keep up the good work. Remember it’s not the number that matters but your decisions. Make the right calls and you’ll do okay.
Congrats! Awesome job. Keep it going. I made $16 today and did the same. All gains are positive.
little bites here & there, keep safe, you will get there with hard work, keep learning. Been trading for 3 yrs and found the right person in august to help

If your stocks start getting depressed, just know they’re working on their self love and they’ll glow up again soon.
Upstart stock got 66$ price target from analysts its 56$ today easy money 💰 😀
👍
i was in the exact same position. as a college student i felt like i was in college for no reason and wasting time because i didn’t know what i wanted to do. once i found the stock market everything just clicked. i’ve been daytrading options for about 2 weeks now, so far on a green week profiting around $30 per day
You can paper trade on think or swim to get stated
Same thing here. I saw what happened last winter and was like-this..this is metal. The “stick it to the vile pigs” who’ve been manipulating the market, manipulating lives, for too long. This is my bag. I decided I’m in. Went full retard and figured if I didn’t put my money “here and there” it would go to silly shit like healthy food.  I’m much happier, a bit thinner in the pants but thicker in the wallet. I’ve still so much to learn but not doing too shabby for a 40 year old lady truck driver lol. I’m hooked.
Keep the gains coming in homie
So many people are stuck in the mindset of broke, and learning a new possible career path like trading gives me realization that all we need is knowledge, determination, and dedication and we can do some amazing things. Stay strong and stay blessed. Starting out that’s exactly how I’ve been with day trading. Make my money and kick back on a green day.
did the same, fucking forget about change rate
You should supplement your trading with a lil cocaine. Brings the mood up and keeps ya sharp between the ears.
Today was my very first day. I bought a penny stock and made 42 cents. I was so thrilled i stopped. $70 seems far away for me so congrats to you :)
thanks! and for sure, people always said the live markets are always different & that really slapped me in the face today. the market seemed to ferociously dip as soon as i bought in, i felt confident in my position & held but it really tests you mentally when you see yourself go red. so i’ll definitely embrace those hard learned lessons
I eagerly await the time I log thousands in gains in a day. I had a day before the slide that was 700 in gains and I felt like the Queen of the market. XD

I did 2 swing trades this morning for the first time (on purpose anyway, I've swung trade the wrong way before lololol) and gained about 40 bucks combined. Nothing great but it was on about 200 bucks worth of spare change in my account, so I'll take 20% any damn day. Just gotta get more confident and comfortable to lay down 1000 instead of 100. :3

My slave wage job makes swing/daytrading really hard some days (and impossible on occasion), though, I'm almost never at my desk and it's because I'm usually working on something with my hands which makes it hard to do anything on the mobile apps.

Does anyone have any suggestions/tips/tricks to make it easier to do a swing trade every now and then when your job makes it difficult? Or am I kinda just at the mercy of whenever I have free time?
Curious parties would like to know how long you have been trading?
As a new trader I'm overwhelmed with the education options out there. Can you recommend some good resources, paid or free to learn day trading?
*you're
Amen 🙏🏼 good work
Please teach me thank you
how long it take you to go from 100 day to a 7k day?
The house always lets you win a few, to keep you in the game.
really 🔥line.
i like that a lot thanks for sharing
Thanks to whomever give me some award. Idk what you do with them? But thanks lol
Poetry my friend!
Odd you should say that.  
I'm an adrenaline junkie and it really pisses me off when I wake up in the morning and nothing looks promising.
Can it be both? :P
It’s the thrill of the hunt
Saving your comment. 

This is the way.
Agreed. I had a penny stock up over 100% and got greedy, left it all on the table. Then the last 2 weeks happened, and I cashed out while it was only about 5% up. Bought back in after 3 days of sliding, thinking it was over. And then it lost for another few days... After today, I am miraculously back up in the green a few % and just hoping like hell it keeps rising the next few days so I can get to a point where I can sell off some shares to ensure I've made my money back. I should've taken half off the top the first time, so it would've been all ""house money"" so to speak. Then it wouldn't have mattered if it dropped like shit the next day, I have the monies to just get more while it's on discount.

I feel like I've seen people explain this exact situation before and somehow I still did it instead of heeding the advice given. Whoops.

edit: I'm new to daytrading as a strategy so this was all longer play stuff, but I think the general idea kind of applies anywhere.
Averaging down has yet to work out for me on those short trades.   It gets out of hand quickly.   

Also I'm just 3 weeks in.  But that hoping for a turn around can get ugly.
How do you even start?
Where do you start!? I wanna start doing this but don’t know shit about the initial process...
Math checks out. See you on the moon, friend.
Interestingly enough, I also started with $500.  Got up to $1500 from Jan to end of Feb

Currently?       $459 😢
I buy you a pint when you get to your billion in a year 
You got extra six months free to get there !
What’s the difference in being a day trader? Are more/different taxes involved?
[deleted]
Lost 720 to gme and now making my way up. Make 53 dollars this month from little positions while I keep learning and watching.
Very, very careful.

Today was a straight ramp upwards loool
Thanks glad someone said it. Read it was the best day since June for s&p 😳
If you lost money you’re doing something wrong
Not OP but I did... guilty lol. At least, being far more active in the market because of it. Before GME I just picked a few stonks to go very, very long on.

I knew there were things called options, though I knew literally NOTHING about how they work (now I know just enough to completely lose my ass on them), I had never heard of a warrant. No clue how to read a chart that wasn't just a line (like robinhood >\_>)...

But when I saw the absolute MADNESS that can happen, and why, I became enthralled in figuring out how this here ""market"" thing works. The last month or so, I think I've missed my self-imposed bed time literally every night, because I'm reading about some company or analyzing a chart or something and next thing I know, it's 3am.
Totally . Great victory but consistently doing it is a whole nuther level
""My computer contains a disease for which there is no cure"".
How are you picking 60 plus trades?
That’s amazing. How long have you been trading?
R you spread betting or r you doing cfd ?
Sounds like the second one made the entire week.
I use WSB and smashing my head against the wall. Am I doing it right?
I made a fortune on gme  baught n sold at least 5x
I love you both
It’s easy to log off. Then I log back on. Then off. Then on. Off.

I have a post it note on my laptop that says ""No Jumpy Trades Fucker!!!"" ...meant to remind me that if i made the trade it was for a good reason and as long as I know where I want the trade to go, be patient. Perfect timing is impossible sometimes but if you did your homework just trust it and let it play out.
[deleted]
After the last 2 weeks, I have learned that red is just temporary and to just laugh at how bad it looks at times. Embrace the crazy, is what I'm saying.
""...but it really tests you mentally when you see yourself go red.""

I resort to verbal abuse, calling myself a coward and much worse names in those moments. Does wonders.
Only hold your position confidently as long as your stop hasn't been hit.
Just remember day trading has the same addictive quality as gambling, an endorphin hit can alleviate depression...
One more from me, I have found that live market with your own money at actual risk brings in having to contend with emotionality that paper doesn't do, and you have the opportunity to learn how to manage that as well.
Set sell limits..
Limit sells, have a mental estimation on where you think the stock is going to go.
2-3 years.
Read ""Making of an American Capitalist"", or any quote by Warren Buffett. Dont take it as gospel but a framework to build your own style and strategy in. Know the fundamentals of company and stock evaluation first and foremost. Cannot stress that enough. There is tons of different resources out there. Use many.
I'm also looking for advice on this.
Then they offer to comp you over at the craps table...
Legit, if I wake up and the pre market is just a sea of blood, it can really ruin the day.
Literally same lol. I am super exposed to TSLA, as I hold a lot of ARK. So when TSLA goes red, I play puts to hedge. Was working great all week until Friday lol. I averaged down just to see a quick 10% in option movement to get out but it just wouldnt give, kept throwing good $ at bad $. Emotions got the best of me smh. Cost me $300. Rookie mistake smh
I am using ThinkorSwim so I started watching the how-to videos for the app. I figure, the better I learn the program, the better I'll understand stonkz.

I started with support and resistance. then learned about market cap and volume. then watched videos on MACD, VWAP, RSI, SMA...

so i pretty much know everything now. that's why I assume I'll be a billionair in a couple months. plus, my smooth brain can't accept anymore information
I haven’t done live trading yet, but I use Reddit to find reputable and non scam youtubers that explain concepts, and EVERY SINGLE time I hear a concept I don’t fully understand, I write it down, then I find articles or videos to explain those concepts, and within THOSE explanations, I write down anything I don’t fully know, so I am basically able to build up lots of understanding about the general concepts.
Get schwab and then order the books technical analysis for dummies and swing trading for dummies. Scale up from there!
Sign up for brokerage account, put money in account, buy stocks with reckless abandon. Kidding but yes, you need a brokerage account to trade in the market. Then you can buy shares of companies you think will do well. As for overall day trading procedures, definitely read into that.

Edit: not sure what country you’re in but in the US, some brokerages people use include TD, Fidelity, Charles Schwab.
Day trading? Or anything dealing with the market in general?
this is the way
but see, you bought stinks. you should only buy stonkz.
Thank you, but I don't need the extra time. I'll be on Mars before you know if!!
[day trading ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_day_trader)

I have a number of different watchlists for different sectors, On any given day, some sectors will be stronger than others.
That is where I start. Also look at news and chat to see what others are thinking.
My dumbass was scalping short positions on meme stocks on very obvious up trends, it worked out but god I felt dumb when I could have just traded with the trend
You know enough about options to be dangerous... to your portfolio lol
meanwhile i’ve been getting up at 6am regularly for the first time since... ever? west coast probs
same here. And I just bought RKT options yesterday and watching it go crazy today.
It’s really not... buy at support lines and sell when your up... don’t buy resistance  or don’t play in between the lines... recycle your shares if your wrong. Later, learn how to be patient to get bigger profits. What matters now is to just be green.. even if it’s 5 or ten bucks or whatever your account (can handle) is. GL
I have scanners, but in this case I did multiple “scalp” trades on GME, AMC, etc
About 5-6 years of investing then 2-3 years of day-trading. Past two years have been great to me!
Neither. I’m not sure on the lingo as I’m very new to day trade but I was observing the stock and entered a buy after I saw the stock hit the same bottom twice and placed my limit order for were the stock had peaked twice before that day as well.
The second trade did make the week.
That's the big trick: patience. No jumpy trades, fucker.
Seriously though, at what point do you differentiate between a worthy trade taking longer than planned to realize and a trade that will collapse in a few minutes and that you should exit now at a smaller loss? Isn't it holding in both cases?
Mine says “ sometimes the best trade is no trade at all”
I'm new, but what I've learned is to set it just below the previous low candle.  Meaning find the previous low before you bought in and then set it just below that.   

You can then measure that distance in price from your buy in to the stop loss.  Then take the most you want to lose on a trade and divide that by the price distance. That gives you the number of shares to buy.  If you hit the stop loss it will stop you out at the most you want to lose on a trade.  

 For instance if the your buy price is 12$  and the stop loss is 11.50 the difference is .50.   If the most you want to lose on a trade is $10 divide that $10 by .50 and you get 20.  That means you can buy 20 shares and if you hit the stop loss of 11.50 you would be out the $10.  

Having said that, if the stock is swinging a lot I might give a wider gap and buy less shares.  But I've found more than not that getting stopped out is a good thing.   I amount I've missed gians  on is nothing compared to what I would have lost if I had stayed in.
I'm also new, so this is just my observation so far...

Chrisvirgo makes good points, I'd also point out that if there's no news and it's dipping, but not quickly, it's likely just temporary. Happened to me this morning with ASRT. I bought some this morning during pre-market, just in hopes that it would have a quick spike because of the chart setup. And when it did I took my profits and stopped looking at the ticker for the rest of the day.

It ended up closing the day 9 cents higher than my exit point, but it dipped in between and I wasn't sure it would keep rising after such a big jump in the morning, so I played it safe. I could've made roughly double what I did on that one if I held until days end, and I could've lost money if I sold after it dropped and stayed down for a while.
I started making real money on the regular when I set my loss exit at -75%. 

Setting to the previous low candle was mentioned and I've found that works better on the 5m and up charts more than a 1m chart. 

When I first started I set 10% or 20% stop losses and did nothing but lose money yet most of the time I'd end up watching the play I was waiting for pan out anyway, but later. Once I accounted for volatility in my approach, the green days and weeks started to become a regular thing.
Be analytical, learn the difference between no new information and real indicators. If you get into something make sure you don't just have a good reason, have a few. Stocks move up and down for a million different reasons and most of them don't matter in, but what does matter is that your original thesis hasn't been proven wrong or it's no longer worth your time to keep your money illiquid.
I personally decide where my exit point is before ever entering a trade, and I have a rule to never lower that exit point. 
If I miss or lose, I just move on to the next one.

Also, you should be deciding that exit point based on  a combo of 

1.) how much account risk you can tolerate(what percent of your account are you willing to lose today? For example I’m not willing to part with more than 1% on any day.

2.) how much volume there currently is.

3.) what the closest resistance point is.

Ironically I also logged $74 today. Woop!
I'd say that is as different as the individual making the play. 

Like, if you go long on something, just forget you bought it, and don't let the day to day bother you...look at the quarter to quarter. Set your stop loss up where YOU are comfy, and just let it ride. 

If, on the other hand, a 50 dollar stock is too pricey for you, as it is for me, because I am the cheapest of cheap arses... and then suddenly you see it dip 10 bucks, it's probably time to pull out. 

I'm just an ape, who flings poo, and has about a month of playing this game, and is up 2500 bucks...would have been 3000 if last week hadn't made me its byotch and didn't even bring the lube... but seriously, it's all about your comfort level, what you can ""stand"" to lose, and how long or short your position is.
You have a plan. Always follow the plan! It leaves no room for error. Stop loss is your friend.
put it an ATR below the last swing low (low point) of whatever timeframe you're in
I originally stopped using them because Robinhood triggered them at market open sometimes without it ever getting close to the limit I set.

I do set some (now that I'm on Fidelity and Charles Schwab) when there's already a decent gap from where I'm comfortable selling and where it is, but it definitely feels like sometimes it will dip just below for a little while and then climb up and the auto trigger would get me, so I gotta figure out how to navigate that.
Wow excellent work! How did you go about learning? I have been dabbling for the last month just using YouTube to learn most things

A free buffet can really change your outlook.
I also trade with an incredible amount of emotion. Really makes my boring life more interesting if I treat every trade as a measure of my self worth
That sucks.  We work so hard to get up that hill.  Then trip and roll all the way back down.
If I give you $18.53 can you make it into a billion too?

Just one is fine with me.
Congrats in advance on your first billion, I’m so proud of you!

to find time is the real problem for me i think
I already tried signing up to eToro but still waiting for verification process to be completed. Then I guess I’ll see what I can do!
Thanks a lot!
I'm not even up to $1000 yet. but I'm trying to be aggressive
well day trading looks to be more like it as considering that i could trade only around market open and close hours which would (in theory) make me a relatively comfortable life.
😀
Indeed, I know that they cost money, and are basically a guess as to where the price will up being by a certain date. Beyond that, still kind of a mystery, so if I did try and play some with my current knowledge I would very likely screw myself out of money. lol
I've been tempted to stay up until 4am to get in at the very start of premarket.

Do I have a gambling problem? D: lol
Nice. Congrats, dude. Week made on MONDAY, no less. Time to retire, amirite?
Hahah so damn true
1. Don’t buy when it’s going up thinking that it might go even higher. Most of people sell after some gainz
2.Try to identify the resistance point, most people make a buy limit so it buy automatically when it hit that point.
3. Don’t get greedy on your gainz and don’t forget the stop lost or the trail sell 
4. Sell before market close if your broker don’t allow you to trade after market. Most of the earnings are before or after market
I'm new to trading and this sticks out to me. I've had a few days where through crap analysis (still learning the game). I couldn't find a stock to buy into. So I didn't for two days.

It was difficult to fight the urge not to play the game as a newbie.
You can get a position size calculator. Helped me a ton.

Lots of people set limits that get triggered on market open, happens to everyone...That's one of the reasons the market is kinda crazy when it first opens. I kind of even wonder if there are bots intentionally trying to trigger them. Maybe there's a way to capitalize on that, but just being patient is what works best for me.
What an ignorant statement.
I agree entirely. XD
Honestly smh. Humbling week though. I was non-stop green from Jan 27th until Presidents Day. I needed the reminder that stonks do in fact, sometimes, rarely, go down
yes. but I'll keep it. thankyoubye!!
that's very sweet of you. thank you
man, that's the same for me... the first week, I did very decently (and I mean after playing with a paper account for a while)... I was able to look at the charts and I could ""see"" it... like the matrix... but then PAF!! it was info overload and I forgot everything and just screwed everything up... so, I started over with various videos, and so now I'm just trying to slow down and really learn one thing at a time. so far, I've learned one thing. LOL
Yeah same. Do you do school or work? I usually do my research at like 8:00 or later cause i dont have time because of schoolwork the rest of the day. And during dead time during the day i compile videos to watch, or knock things off my research list.

Thank you we will see if something looks good I will probably jump on it.
Thanks!
Do you have any tips on how to set an effective SL
Just advice because you say your new , pick 5 stocks with volume and some volatility and stay with those.if those arent moving, then you stay out of it for the day.Or trade micro mini futures, the same one every day. You need baselines to make picks against. A new stock everyday is asking for trouble because you have no history with it and no real DD time , just TA, and with stocks and options, you need the DD , not just the TA like you can do with futures.
> position size calculator

Excel (or libre calc) formulas on a custom trade sheet template. That way you're automatically recording the trade too.
I try not to trade the first 10 to 15 minutes of open.  But I know there are people that love trading that.  Maybe with more experience I'll try it, but right now to me it seems too unpredictable.
It's really helped me since I started reminding myself of it during red days. My overall panic was COMPLETELY absent the last few days. I was more depressed, not gonna lie, but I wasn't panicking... and as someone riddled with anxiety, that experience makes me more confident than ever that I can do this shit. :D

I try to get in when they are LESS than a penny, and ride them until they hit 5 or 10 cents or so. 
DPLS was one I bought at .001 and it popped to .03 and .04 it doesn't sound like much... but I made 800 bucks off of it. I bought like 20k shares of it at .001 I sold half to recoup my investment, invested it in other stocks, and sold half of that to get profits, and still hold about 7500 shares... watching them grow, and fall, and grow, each day.
DD is for suckers. I just Yolo on the reddit stock I see mentioned on reddit. 
step 1 - reddit 
step 2 - profit
i am not a financial advisor. But first you need to understand the graphic, every candle have a meaning, candle that goes up and candle that goes down. Second you need to understand what’s a resistance and what’s a support, people put order on the support so when it reach out a lot buyer buy in the same time so volume goes up and price to
I’m new as well. That first half hour is a blast. So far, I’ve had overall success trying to find deals on things I’ve already been following or ill sell / take profits on portions of my positions that seem to be going through a larger than expected bump that exceeds the trend lines without any news or fundamentals that support it. Then, when it comes back to earth, I might reenter because it’s still something I believe in for the long.  If it doesn’t, I’ve realized some profits and can take more when things slow down. 
Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered. This has been a good reminder for me.

How do you find these penny stocks?
I didn't get into anything new, but I did keep buying into positions I already held. Makes getting back to green and overall profits that much sweeter."						
Should we work on developing a FAQ here in order to improve knowledge and discussion?	295.0	https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/nfbagl/should_we_work_on_developing_a_faq_here_in_order/	"Would be nice to be able to link people to some _objective_ site instead of writing yet another document on blockchain.
Maybe even just links to youtube videos with intuitive animations.
I’m new and just getting into crypto. So I think It would be great
I think that would be very useful - I still lose track of some of the acronyms and names for concepts - I have to sneak off and look them up!
 yes please create a wiki faq in this sub
Yes please, there’s way better mediums for explaining the basics of crypto than a reddit comment
Write some stuff up and I'd be happy to put it in the wiki.
One of Mike Maloney’s “Hidden Secrets of Money” episodes is an excellent introduction to Bitcoin and Blockchain for beginners.
sup, came across #BitCanna, what would u say? 
This would very helpful!

If you’re looking for inspiration, the Cardano subreddit have a very comprehensive sticky thread, that I’m finding very useful as a beginner

https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
100%
I'm waa
Lol oh my gosh yea. Even with community help I've had to just go from whitepaper to white paper atm
Yes, please. I'm a newbie and i'm trying to get good informations about this topic and it's hard.
Yes. I keep researching, but the amount of technobabble on some of the best cryptos is overwhelming. What the hell is a parachain, and then check out Polygon's website because it's so tech filled no one knows what they are buying.
This would be perfect! Even people who think they understand certain subjects might be surprised by other people's knowhow!
I think it would be a great idea. I'm all for learning since I'm exactly what is described, someone new who is researching
That was actually the first thing that I looked for when I started a month or so ago.
A primer on common terms  and a community curated list of significant crypto projects would be nice.

When you see thousands of coins listing it would be helpful to know what are projects that are doing something meaningful and different, technology-wise, as opposed to those that are just a fork of another project so someone can rug pull during the hype.
I posted a post about the beginning of crypto and it isn't anywhere on new. 

It would improve knowledge and lead to a discussion . . .
absolutely! it would be really nice to participate in a conversation-driven forum that seeks to educate in a healthy way. crypto is such a nuanced and interesting topic, everyone who is interested deserves to have access to reliable resources to sustain that interest.
This might be a shameless plug but the CryptoDevHub Wiki was just started a month ago to solve this exact problem.

https://wiki.cryptodevhub.io

It's a community-driven Wiki with curated articles, links and resources. The goal is to have one place to collect and categorize the signal in the crypto (technology) noise.
I totally support this idea, what it takes to have/make such FAQ？
Yes I couldn't agree more. I think it could help with the quality of the sub so we link to some standard high quality stuff, rather than people coming here and shilling their blogs and bs like that. 

Also related to crypto a lot of people are in the boat of I wana understand xyz (say writing a smart contract with Solidity) but don't know the first step. To me, that's not a good post, I'd rather see what they've done after they've taken the first step.
Yes. This would probably be most helpful. An FAQ filled with links to articles, videos, etc. would probably be best. I am very much a newbie to this, and links to reliable, educational material would be greatly appreciated.
You should all check out https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/! Its a site intended to bring together blockchain engineers and academic researchers working on blockchain adjacent subjects.

As an example of the value add: [this post](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/discussion-post-flashboys-to-flashbots/411) explores the current state of Flashbots, a toolset for identifying and acting on Miner Extractible Value
A [token curated registry](https://republic.co/blog/crypto/overview-of-token-curated-registries) would be a cool way to utilize the tech to create this resource.

Crossing 1 Mil Profit. Never Thought I Would Able To Get Here This Early. But I Just Want To Says Thank You To Everyone In This Forum Who Supported Me.	6101.0	https://i.redd.it/kfjbdg38buo61.png	"Incredible job! Congrats!

I’m sure a lot of the sub would love to see a break down of some sort of your approach towards this lofty goal!
Yeah let’s get a strategy breakdown on this beauty.  Damn.  You’re making it look easy.
Wow - congrats! Looks like you started with circa $10k?
A lot of his earlier posts from years ago have been deleted but this dude was scalping like 500 orders a day on highly volatile low floats. A lot of haters but he found a strategy and setup that worked for him and is probably the most successful scalper I’ve ever come across. Good job. Also everyone asking what is his strategy he simply looks at the level 2 and scalps non stop. Sitting infront of the computer for 8 hours blasting away orders, cancelling, closing. His percentage profitable was extremely high like ~90% if I remember. This is however the strategy I remember from over a year ago so he might have refined or changed it.
Fuck you. Congratulations.
""Trade like Machine gun""

I swear I'll never forget the post you made lmao.
Congratulations 🎉 what starting capital amount did you begin with?
Best/worst trade youve made?
Congrats. Care to share any insight on your strategy?
Congratulations! Well done.
Some intel on how you got there man? Congrats!!
Wow.. within 1 year You became a millionaire. Congratz !
What app is this?
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEY1Oe2Ywhs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEY1Oe2Ywhs)

He is in this video, this may be a similar strategy for what he does. I would like for his comment but he seems to keep his strategy private, having as much cash as he does I imagine he can move a lot of volume in penny stocks and create his own sell and buy channels.

Also used to reply to comments a lot more often, a lot of people are rude to him and I can see why he doesn't care to reply to people.

Check it out on a tanking stock... dude is a machine. Started with sub 30k I believe it was.

I've been following your progress for a while and this is great.  U and Madaz are doing quite well catching knives :-)
congrats! question, do you think you will have any issue with withdrawals/ taxes?
Congratulations.... fuck you!
What platform is this???
Can you share what strategy you used and how much you started off with? Also any advice for someone just starting off?
Congrats man. 

&#x200B;

How did you get to this point?
Nice work man!! 
That’s impressive! 
You’re either a quick learner or one lucky son of a gun! In this case probably both! 
Congrats, I’m happy for you!
How many monitors do you use?
Wow congrats!!! What an achievement! What is your strategy and stats? Did you paper trade first?
Any tips on how you made the journey? This was my goal starting out.
Congratulations bud! Well deserved
I remember being at work seeing your post about quitting your job to trade full time. Congrats kyle 👏
Congrats OP! Been lurking your account for a while now and seeing u grow is awesome! :). Just wondering, where did u learn how to scalp and do u think bear bull traders is a good chatroom to buy?
Hey Congrats u/Phihix  Great work! Would love to hear about what worked for you and what did not.
Really curious what platform op was using? that UI is really nice
There are record markers we must pass, 1k, 3k, 5k, 25k, 250k 500k 1mill.  this far along I have gone through 25k - 250k a few times. 

If a dumb aaa ape like me can do it, you can hit 1millie np
I absolutely love this guy. I've been obsessed with reading his old posts and watching his youtube. Insane, crazy returns with such a level headed, clean strategy. And he does it all by hand, no AI, no team, no algos. 

I'm glad he doesn't comment anymore, too many people trying to leech off him and criticizing. Fans will continue watching regardless. 

Enjoy your gains Mr Vu 👊
Why do people get so excited looking at someone scalping like this that shares 95% results, and 5% of the strategy.    Get excited about people that have better returns than this, don't take 20+ trades a day, and have a scalable strategy that doesn't require hours of trading each day, and that offer to help people by showing how they trade.  There are people out there that do that, but everyone here gets tied up with this stuff.  There's no real benefit for you at all.
Any chance you wanna tell us what you end up paying in taxes lol
Congratulations pecker!
Where’s the dips!
Jesus
Bruh. What is your strategy. Id love an in-depth post on how you trade.
Congrats hope you get to 2 mil.
What platform is this?
Hey congrats! Can I ask what software your using there?
Good work. Mind me asking what you started with and what you look for when investing?
That's awesome!  What did you start with?
Nice, what was your daily/monthly goals or was it just to finish in the green every day?
Nice work Kyle - always love seeing your progress posts and really enjoy when you and Eric hop on John’s livestreams.
Let me know when to drop my wife off
Is it true you got kicked off TDA for a exceeding their no-commission threshold for number of trades? From your previous posts I see you are still using TOS.
What software or interface is this?
If you’re going to photoshop a graph, at least space the bars out evenly.
Teach me? 

How do you generate a quality strategy?
Freaking awesome! Congratulation, up to A LOT more millions! 🚀
thats amazing! congrats.
Great! Congratulations! Any breakdown on your journey till there?
Nice work!
You doubled your account in less than two months😱
I will get to your level. I’m sure you had dedicated a lot of time on your strategy and discipline. 
I will get to your level because I don’t doubt the possibility what so ever. Nor do I want to compare myself to anyone. It is the greatest joy to see some doing what I want to do. Not so much with the amount you make but the consistency you have.


And congratulations man. Not that my props do you any good or harm. And thank you for not sharing your strategy. It’s bullcrap that people want an easy way out without true innovation of their own. You are no different than an Elon Musk or a Bill gates. Just in your own realm. 

I can’t wait for Sunday for futures to open! Happy trading everyone.
Heys, you haven't posted in a while. Provide an update dude. The last month and a half has been pretty bad. Curious to see what you up to and how you doing. Kinda enjoy your posts too.
Amazing. I would love to watch your video recaps.  Pity they are all gone.  I hope there's someone out there who saved the youtube videos?  Please send me a message. I have been looking to learn trading for months. Thanks
What's about 2022? You lost everything again?
What is the secret?
So this is just a bragging post, since you wont deign to discuss your strategies? Nice.
How long have you been trading? I just started 6 months 8 months ago.
Congrats!  Great shot, I find it interesting the total of losers you had vs winners, long vs short etc.  but the old say rings true.  It takes money to make money.
If I see another fake post on profit .
Tired of all the lies and building up of stocks .
You tube is filled with this crap .
u da man
congratulations man! hoping to get started this year! any hot tips for new traders or care to weigh in on some strategy?
Yo does anyone know a good group or anything I can join to learn day trading?
Wow congrats and a big salute to you. Please share some of the strategy with us apes. 🇺🇸
Gotta say this is not really a very helpful or insightful post without any discussion of your strategy. Just kind of a brag post. Congrats though.
How much did you start with and how long this take?
Something about this just seems sus. Started at 10k? Genuinely curious 

If legit, wow - a rare bird, and congrats.
You can finally tell your wife's boyfriend to get lost. 

You can probably dump the wife also.
Congratulations!
Congratulations... very 👍

Congrats 🎉🎉🎉
Teach me!
Hi, buddy good job. I followed you ever since you started your journey. Congrats and best to you and your family in Vietnam.
Congratulations. Great to see such success.
Why no response from OP on how they got there?? Any advice on winners and losers??
Would love to know how you trade ! Absolutely incredible job well done and congrats on hitting 6 figures !
How much you started with?
Does anyone pay taxes anymore? Not to take away from this feat thou! Congratulations!
Congratulations!  I just started a few weeks ago and I’m struggling to get out of the value trader mindset.  I only need to double my holdings 5 times and I’m right there with you! 😂

Badass man. Great going! 💪💪💪

Congrats. Such short time in 7 months. Amazing since one doubles since Feb 2021. Must practicing shorts.
Fuck ya. Good for you bro.

Awesome.  Love to see people win. Dont forget your taxes ;-)
Congrats man ! 

I've been following your posts for sometime. you've evolved a lot and from thousands of scalps to few for a day but more profitable than you were. !

&#x200B;

Good luck on your next multi-million milestones...
Dude you said like a year ago if you ever got to 1 million you would stream for a day!
Nice one, the best thing is not the amount but the consistency, no huge pnl swings
300k to Uncle Sam.
So you are saying buy low and sell high actually works
Congrats and f*** you 🥳
Dope, can’t wait to make my million
Amazing. Congratulations!
Congrats! I remember you saying you would do a live stream video of you trading and your strategy once you hit a million. You still plan on doing so?
What's ur strategy ? And how much was ur initial account balance ?
Congratulations! I enjoyed following your trading journey the past year. 

Here's to your continued success.
How
Options or Cash?
Excellent work. Ad astra
What service do people use for all these trades? How do you start trading. I only have cash in a few stocks that I just hold onto
That's one superb graph!

You are a VERY consistent trader, looks great
Nice! May I ask with how much capital did you start?
Magenta. Leading the way mate.
Saving for later
Wow that's amazing!  Congratulations
Congratulations! Can you please direct us on HOW to do it????
Idc about the strategy I enjoy the journey. Just wanted to say I'm proud of you and I am sure you're proud of yourself!
Holy crap congratulations!
Congrats...instead of saying I'd love to hear your approach to this and blah blah blah...here take my money and just do it for me haha!

Enjoy the fruits of your labour.
How do you scan/ find stocks to scalp?
fantastic!
How. The. Fuck. 😅 that’s awesome!
Congrats! Love seeing this type of win. What software do you use to track your numbers like that?
What a fuckin beast. Would love to buy you a beer and pick your brain, man
Awesome man. Congrats. What, may I ask, is your age?
You mother fucker I'm in! But I can't find the ticker for that graph.
Well, no reply from OP. That's a shame.
What software is this ? Or is it the broker ? 

I would love to track my activity like this
Wait till you see what that’s gonna be after taxes.
Nice man! For the rest of us idiots who will probably never see this number in their account, lol, what are some tips that helped you get there?
This really means nothing without knowing your starting capital.
What do you do for a living outside of trading? Or, what did you do before to get to this point?
Congrats on that amazing achievement bro. In my country half of that amount is enough for you to retire young and live the rest of your days comfortably.
thats awesome, how? im barely breaking even
what is this screenshot from? like what platform/app?

&#x200B;

my trading-experience would be SO much better if i had an interface like this
What platform can you make this many trades on?
Just out of curiousity, I tried the machine gun strategy the OP apparently does.

Sht actually worked - much easier to predict a .05 cent move than .10/.25/.50 and so on...gonna keep trying to see if I can get some consistency.
What asset do you trade? Stocks, options, or futures? Thanks
Congrats! What a great feeling that must be! I’m just really getting serious with my own investments and have a heck of a long way to go, but it’s inspiring to see when people hit the mark, so thanks for sharing!
So basically he is like an algo hft trader in human form and speed?
What did you trade? Tickets? Options?
Congrats. A major milestone I hope to cross sooner than later.
How much is your starting?
You did good man, we should all give this man a round of applause!
Congratulations 🎈🍾🎉🎊🥃🥃🥃🥃
Just wanted to comment to say that you're definitely an inspiration! Thanks for sharing your progress with us!
Realy cool👏
What ever happened to ToS did the kick off you or charge you?
u/Phihix shoutout to your success. Congrats. Any plans from hereon?
How much taxes did you pay?

since you play in and out same stock ticker, does Wash Sale rule applicable for your trades?
I’m curious what program is he using that produced this graph?
Grats but taxes are gonna be a big oof
Can anybody tell sich platform he is trading on?
in awe
Go baby boy go
Congratulations dude. Smashing it.
I have a question, I have around 3500$ in stocks, I’m not getting myself discouraged but how can you fathom the price of 1 million dollars because I feel like I’m YEARS out, just trying my best to get there, any tips with how to cope with losses on a major scale and just how you can bounce back and recover? Thanks and congrats! (Also what application are you using?
Covid quadrupled so many stocks after the wallop, I started April 2020 with the minimum 1500, grew it to 32000, but now down to 23000, that discipline you speak of? I lost it and am bagholding a couple stocks. PLL @69, SOL@12, SOS@5.8, wwpd? What would poster do?
What platform is that? Also, can I ask what was your starting balance? I too want to build my account to $1MM
Do you have any long positions at all? 👀
I hate your guts! <3
I Just got a remindme about this
What’s seems almost impossible is that there are no drawdowns
Huge congrats man!
Congratulations! How much did you start with and how long did it take you?
Hey how has your trading been going since your posted this 3 months ago? Hope all is going good with you and the family! Enjoyed watching your progress, give us an update!
Is there any good courses one could take for day trading? Something that will give you a basic understanding? If anyone has any pointers or has taken a course or read a certain book and point me in its direct I’d greatly appreciate it
Nice
Which tracking program is this?
The fact that he did this in just over a year blows my mind. I’ve been trading for 4 months now and have lost 7 grand. I know exactly what I’m doing wrong and see the strategies that make me money and see how I’m losing money so I’m going to call that 7 grand my market tuition and keep moving forward. Hopefully a year from now I’ll be able to post some gains like this even if it’s 1/10th of this I’ll be happy.
Motivation and hope
Omg this is a huge accomplishment, congratulations
Why does it only go up I don’t understand
lol its funny you got awards,weird to think that people gave money to a millionaire
Dude or chick your graph goes up 97 times and down like 3 times, what are you doing?
good job u can be pround!
It seems that you have experience and I will just go into this, any advice or where to invest first?
What program is this?
Nice man!

What is this software and does it allow you to add forex accounts
Could you please share your discipline strategy?
Congratulations friend!! 
I have always wished to be good at market and trading; last year I lost 40k however I  have still kept those junks stocks in my account but don’t do any activities since their values have gone around %70 down. 
Since you did such a superb job, could you let me know what to do, where you learned …? I’ll appreciate it!
In this economy? 👀👀👀
Update?
That is amazing! Congratulations. Im currently learning as much as I can and hope to achieve this some day. Becoming a trader as a full time job would be a dream for me. Any advice for someone starting from a small account?
Fuck these comments bro. You are amazing! Good Job!
Has anyone ever used TrustFinance?
Nice! How much did you start with and how long did it take you to start getting more positive confident trades
hi guys what will you expect from CPI data ? is USD will be stronger? I just short GBPUSD at 1.20845 on Monday😭
Does anyone know what data visualization OP is using here to graph the results? Looks really clean…
Congrats 👍🏻
Shall appreciate your help to be where u are.
I know this is an old post but does he trade, futures? stocks? forex?

Congratulations
this is dope to see
How do you pay taxes on this? Serious question. You never pulled cash out , you carried the money over the year. Don’t you owe like 200k plus come February and stuff then I assume after this pic some was pulled out for taxes or?
2y passed, how’s the journey?
Congrats bro
Wow, that's incredible! Congratulations on crossing the 1 million profit milestone in trading! It's truly inspiring to see your hard work and dedication in trading paying off so well. Keep up the fantastic work, and here's to even greater success in the future! 🚀💰
Came here to say the same. Would love to hear about your setup/strategy. But, also, congrats!
He is involved in this video, maybe something similar and since he has a lot of cash he can move a lot of volume and possibly set up his own buy sell walls? Previously mentioned they do penny stock candlesticks.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEY1Oe2Ywhs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEY1Oe2Ywhs) \- edit never added the video lol

he shared in the past a video of 36 minutes (with 2x speed or something like that) of trading in a normal day, > 95% explicit or more... 3 or 4 days later the video as removed...

Yeah Raymond would like to follow the steps of trades he does! Too.
Covid 2020 bull run made it easy.

Edit: for the love of god to you sensitive people, my bad on the piss poor wording of choice.

I get he worked his ass off scalping ass loads of trades per day to get where he is. He did a fine job no doubt.

And realistically speaking, from my poor observation with no prior knowledge of OPs trading skills before hand, he dropped his bags AFTER March 2020, without a doubt, the best time in stock history probably to have dropped your cash in. Anyone and anything would have likely done very well, this no doubt likely enhanced OPs trading to get to where he is now. 

Quit whining and saying I’m an ass or saying why am I not a millionaire?!? I’m not competing or comparing it’s a simple fact covid 2020 definitely made things a lot easier for everyone if you had cash.
& had $250K 6 months later
If one can average 2% compounded *every* day, that's enough to bring $7,800 up to $1M in a year (250 trading days).  Not remotely easy by any stretch, but not impossible.

1900 trades per day

😱😱😱😱
500 orders a day? by hand??

damnnnnn
He also said he would love stream his strategy when he hit a million.
If I may ask, as a beginner, what does scalping mean?
So he’s a hardcore disciplined scalper. Good for him.
Your DD on OP was amazing to read, thanks for digging. What a story. OP’s starting to flex on family members and it’s great. Wanna see videos of their reactions
He must be buying the bid and selling the ask. No way he could make profit with how slow TDs execution is.
Go to hell, I'm very happy for you.
Probably $2 mil
Asking the important question.
25K. But he burned a couple of accounts before, so you could probably add that as an ""investment""
About tree fiddy
He does tons of ultra short-term scalps around longer positions from what I've seen. 

Basically a scalper. 

Which is why it's hilarious that people think this guy is only profitable because of the bull run. He's scalping, he'd probably make money during black monday lul
I’ve seen quite a few of his posts in the past and a few videos.  He does very high volume scalping. Very similar to Madaz Money on YouTube.
He won’t share his strategy
Judging from his title I'd say Starting With Capital Is Key
Covid 2020 bull run, anyone who put down a couple bags in march2020-Jan 2021 made off solid.

Not saying that’s the only reason, skill takes place too but it certainly makes it stupid easy with a huge bull run after everything tanked.
That was my goal last year. I’ll make it happen this year. :) how do you set that remindbot?
Tradersync
From what I've seen people are partly rude due to his hesitancy to talk about his strategy.

it seems to come from a fear that his strategy will no longer work, or at least become less effective, if some know about it. 

Unfortunately I'm too new to the game to know whether or not revealing even partially one's strategy would be enough to reduce its profitability
Madaz?
Tradersync
I think he’s hooked into the Matrix directly.
xD
yeah i agree this strategy he does is basically pure price action and Level 2 reading skill. Its insane. I actually think this strategy is one of the most legit types... no astrological ""double dildo harmonic convergence indicator"" reading and shit like that. Just price action reading. At least that's how i understood. I kinda want to learn this strategy and have been watching some of his vids but he makes it look easy when it's really hard.
1. Some of us *like* trading for hours every day.
2.  Very few ppl with an actual edge are going to just give it away.
3.  With a little bit of research you can figure out what he's doing.  I have and I'm in the process of implementing it with extremely small position sizes.  
4.  Stop gatekeeping
Then who are some guys that have better %returns, take a low amount of trades and who don't have to trade all day with the strategy also being scalable?

He used to share his strategy before but then everyone started copying so he took all his YouTube video off the net and stopped positing.

I’m not the OP, but thought I’d give my technique which may or may not work for others... I have about 15k in stocks that are expected to do well and are found in many long term portfolios, but when given the opportunity, I also day trade them... I know the usual up-down range and buy extra shares when they are on the low end of the wave to resell hours or a few days later when they reach the high end or close to what I expect as the high end (of course I’ve kicked myself a few times)... I’ve made as much as a 20% profit in one day, amount of course depends on what you put in.  If you’ve got a few $$ to play with, my two main ones are FLGT $90-$103 buy/$107-$120 sell & LMND $95-$100 buy/$110 sell .. they have high volatility but still maintain a high long term value so even if you make a buy when they’re at the top end, you won’t lose as long as you don’t lose your head.  I should also say that I trade only with my own savings, I won’t play with margins or anything like that, and I won’t touch options... too risky.  If you use your own cash, you have no way to make a mistake that you can’t jump back out of.

Hope this helps give ideas
Lol people always assume profitable traders have some secret formula. Fact is there is many many basic strategies that can make u money. The problem isn't strategies, the problem is emotions.
Agreed
Ditto
Do penny stock candlesticks? What’s that mean? Trading according to the price action? Or do it like a MM controlling the candlestick direction?
I get that scalping penny stocks is what worked for him the most part.
Holy shit why is everyone hating on you for simply stating facts lol
Man u re salty... commenting on every praise OP get... those returns looks like 10K to 1M, which is around 100x bagger...
JFC some people will never be happy... just say “congrats!” and be happy for others. Holy fuck dude.
So how well did you do?
Idk that I would say *easy*, but it definitely jumped out at me that the account starts at more or less the bottom of the crash
Except OP is scalping and taking [thousands of trades per day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/hovv5x/for_me_to_trade_like_a_machine_must_be_in_my/fxo73qo/?context=3) The bull run has little to do with it.
He’s made money on downward trending stocks. He’s just a scalper. Trades like a machine.
You make good points, but I posted in March 2020 about the market ending the year higher than it started and got lit up for being a buffoon. In hindsight it's easy to see that was the right call, but at the time it was not prevailing thought
& was nudging $500k 3 months after that - seems like a decent business model 😬🥸
Looking at his history, he’s a machine - may/ May not be genuine? 

Compound interest/ profit does add up though!
What does compounded mean in the context of day trading?
[deleted]
You may well be right
He did reduce the number of orders though. He definitely refined his process, as we all should do all the time.
Tda will shut you down if you trade that much more than a week or so.
Are those red sections where he shorted, or just sold his shares?
I think the most impressive thing is that he could sit in front of a screen scalping little profits for this long.  But if he is following rules with technical analysis and he has a profitable strategy, then yee-haw.  I could not have a job and also make 1900 trades a day so I assume he did it full time.  Its also a very non-efficient tax strategy, assuming he had $1M of gains he will have to pay probably $450K in taxes depending on where he lives.
If I remember correctly it might have been in the thousands LOL. Yup all manually. He got kicked off TDA because they have a 390 order a day limit for commission free trading. Commission free really helps when you’re scalping as commissions can really eat into profits on scalps however you can use a direct access broker and get rebates from exchanges as well which I believe he switched too at some point. However if I was to go out on a limb I would bet that most of the profits have been from recent meme stocks blowing up 10x and such. The more volatile the market the more profit opportunity and this man is taking advantage of it beautifully.
kys, ily
Kind of the only question
I would hope he could make money on a black Monday scenario since that's basically the easiest and fastest way to make money. Crashes are the best
Is this guy actually legit? His returns seem too good to be true.
he won't get to 10M if he does...
Lol if it’s so easy why don’t u show some pics of ur account with the million dollars u made? People are such haters in this sub
lol, then go ahead and make your millions on the 2021 bear run
Yes please remind us if it happened! I'm new here so don't know how You set a remind me 😂
He used to be much more chatty, a lot of people insulted him and he even had youtube vids up they talked shit about. I believe it can effect his strategy because he has the money to move the volume and sell buy walls as he wants and not rely as much on luck. Moving 100k in a penny stock is a shitload of volume you have control over for example.
YouTuber Madaz Money. He's a scalper.

OP based his strategy on Madaz's with a few tweaks apparently.
Wow, i try to give some actual advice based on real experience, and the fool decides to call it gatekeeping.  But naivety is a fool's blessing!

Moreover, you've made this process so overly complicated, traders and market makers like me feed on your bones daily.  How much have you given us over the years trying to implement BS, code, indicators, learning options and futures, begging for edge, using every scanner under the sun.     


Last bit of advice, take it or lose.  Drop all the complicated crap.  Trading is very simple.  99% of people fail because they think it is complicated and they are looking to chase shit that people like this guy post.  How many more times are you going to chase?  You won't have any legs or money by the time you're done.
The vast majority of professionals that learned how to trade at real firms.  They might put on 5-7 trades a day.  You might argue that they have more capital, but they also make much more in % returns as well.    Most people I am with in a current trading room take MAYBE 3-4 trade per day MAX and have high returns and win averages from 70-90%.  Sitting on your ass all day trading scalps is ridiculous.
I mean daytrading is still investing money...

Maybe I could used a better word, but I’m subscribed to a lot of stock reddits, and randomly saw this.

And I don’t really see the point in derailing the thread just for a simple terminology.
gave his ass to @catchpen
Because I for fun made some screen shots and you can doctor these screens or paper money account , ect . It could be real , but let’s agree to disagree that maybe 50% of these posts are real .
IIRC, this is the same guy who used to post like 200-300 trades per day. If that's his strategy, I can't think of many people who would have the stamina to copy it.
I hate you fake Yoda Bot, my friend the original Yoda Bot, u/YodaOnReddit-Bot, got suspended and you tried to take his place but I won't stop fighting.
        
        -On behalf of Fonzi_13
It does definitely help in ideas of what to trade into, but I was leaning more towards software, right now I use Robinhood (despite everything for convenience) what do you use for the day trading?
Not looking for secret. That assumption is like saying I  asked Lebron James his workout routine bc I'm looking for a secret. Hard work is the magic formula obviously, but practicing correctly is powerful. You ask people who are successful what their habits are not because it's a secret formula, but bc they have habits losers aren't willing to adopt. Don't put down people asking smart questions with assumptions. Not helpful.
and timing, arguably one of the most important factors
I agree, but it is reassuring to see how successful traders do it too
yeap, risk management is huge. I see traders self destructing all the time because they refuse to manage risk
Ain't that the fucking truth
[deleted]
💯
Absolutely.
Took the words right out of my mouth.
Happy cake day 

But I disagree. Strategies that are successful are valuable. Emotions only trigger with drawdown and most strategies that are profitable don’t have significant drawdown.
Nah, they keep it a secret if everyone knew then no one would make money. Their is a deep state of investors thag rule the world . And when you figure out the formula to make money off of others and the government. They forcibly recruit and brainwash you. I know I escaped people say I got schizophrenia but I say NAY
It seems that you have experience and I will just go into this, any advice or where to invest first?
Thats some golden words
You are so right, emotion is maybe 90%. I've said before that you could flip a coin and go long on heads and short on tails and be profitable with good money management.
At 1M you can probably do both. Did you watch the video lol
It's not facts though... 

If you actually *look* at the graph, you see that the past few weeks since mid-February where everyone was crying about BeAr mArKeT have been some of his most profitable. 

It's literally just a demeaning comment playing down the insane amount of skill and hard work OP put into this. 

It's funny how people assume things about OP without even looking at the post properly.
Probably his followers or something idk lol
My bad wasn’t trying to sound salty, I was just trying to imply that almost anything bought after March would have done well. The cash I had did 300% and calls I played that year did fantastic too. The rest I had to sit on and hold.
This is a graph of profit, not balance.

If he started with $1m, he could have put it in anything for 2020.
Fantastic year with calls, most positions I had to hold since they were pre-2020. The cash I did have on hand after March did about 300%.

I didn’t mean to sound critical, just saying almost everything did well if someone put cash in after March 2020.
Bro just type in any stock you like and look at it from march-now. He’s not joking lol.
it's not worth spending effort informing these guys. very low iq here.
How does one scalp ?
I love that growth triangle, so linear, he would make pythagoras proud
Ehh post covid has been a huge consistent market wide bull run. OP certainly is a good trader (hell look at these profits) but the stratergy OP used would probably be less profitable during any other period.
It means you keep making profit on your trades which allows you to then have more buying power which then allows you to make bigger trades which then allowed you to make bigger profits and so on until you have a shit load of money 😏😳😳
Compounded just means that if you start with $10k and make 2% one day, you end the day with $10,200.  Next day you're trading with $10,200, make 2%, end the day with (10,200*1.02=) $10,404, which is the amount you're trading with the day after that, etc.  Basically it means whatever you make trading each day is added to the amount you're using to trade the next.  IRL it wouldn't be exact like this, but as long as you average about the same % gain each day (easier said than done), the math holds.
I think it would be scaling position size as your account grows.
Of course not.  But I doubt OP was using the full $1M on each trade, unless they were trading something like SPY.  You can also make more, smaller trades at the $100k level..
It's what he said. Idk man. Talk to him.
I have 0 clue of which broker he's using but assuming he trades from 4 am to 8 pm, its ~2 trades/mins, it obviously has to be more than a full-time. 8 hrs would brings him to ~4 trades per mins which I don't think that's possible. It definitely sounds tedious and boresome, but trust me, me and heck tons of people would do it without hesitant for this return rate of 1M+ USD/yr
I'm a noob, what's meant by scalping in this context?
Worth it for sure
A lot of it had to be some of the meme stocks.  But again, like I posted above, he is doing it full time, and they are all short term gains, so he could owe the government hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Still nice to make a a few hundred g's in salary but its basically the same as having a full time job.
How the hell does anyone do 4 trades per minute by hand?
It feels like if any strategy would work during a bull or bear market - it would be scalping.  Assuming you are going long and short, and know how to play both sides.
how can you tell when a black monday is happening? like any sort of ""indicators"" before it happens or does it usually catch everybody by surprise?
why are crashes good? wouldn't stuff be short halted anyway? idk how it works just asking.
Phihix is legit Imo. I've seen a lot of his videos. He doesn't sell anything and just does what works for him. His strat is definitely not for everyone. 

Madaz on the other hand sells courses and comes across as too hype. To me he's just another furu.
I don't quite understand how letting some people know how he does things could blow up this strategy's profitability.

Is it really that critical to keep your strategy a secret?
😂
>It was easy = hating        

lol wut?
I didn’t say it’s easy or hating? I made off well too, spite having to sit on the majority of my bucket and wait. I even said skill is involved.

All I’m explaining that is OP dumped a bag after March 2020 after literally everything tanked. It’s not meant to be an insult or jab, it’s simple facts, it was very easy to buy calls and buy everything on sale and let it rocket if you had cash. Not everyone had cash either since everyone also freaked out and jobs were closing or going remote left and right.
I love when people see this and they’re like yeah it was easy. Why the hell didn’t you do it then? You must be super stupid I guess.
Ive made millions just the cameras weren't on...
If you dumped any amount into any major airline this time last year, you literally over doubled your money. So please /u/clarkymlarky , chill a bit and realize the pandemic lowered the bar for a lot of new investors and made it a field day for seasoned ones.
I gotta work on the putting game lol
Haha I think it’s !remindbot
RemindMe! June 30 2021
RemindMe! June 30 2021
He mentioned that he started with sub 30k and used Madaz Money and Investors Underground I believe. My apologized I didn't put Madaz and youtube together for some damn reason.
For a million fucking dollars, no it's not
Yeah
I use Merrill Edge, and I recently opened a Schwab account to get the $100 bonus, but it’s not as user friendly
When I get my hands on that Secret Formulerrrr...
Habits wasn't the question. He asked what his startgy or set ups are. Those don't matter much. Anyone with half a brain can learn trading strategies and patterns that work. But few people can learn to be disciplined enough to correctly control themselves to rationally execute those patterns entry stop out and profit taking.
False- steroids are the magic formula.
Here here
Assuming despite your avatar you’re not diamond handing haha
Don’t believe everything you read here .
This snake oil and people hyping stocks has been on for years . Many people are losing and these fake posts about gains .
Would you be on Reddit posting daily if you were a millionaire?
You should ask Paul Tudor Jones what he thinks of that.
Emotions trigger with every trading action whether a loss or a win. The most common time for a big drawdown is after a series of wins and the trader feels ""unstoppable*
There is always money to be made in the market. Even if the bear is in your sector.
Seriously. I threw $150 into a shitcoin six months ago and woke up to a $9500 surprise this morning. Nothing makes sense anymore. Enjoy what profits you can reap.
He was at a $400k return in January...
Agree ofc, u re not wrong, completely agree.
Where's your announcement that you just broke a million then?

Scoffing at something being easy when you've not been able to do it yourself is a weird way to respond to someone.  300% might have been easy - which is why you were able to achieve it.  OP has done orders of magnitude more than that.
And probably could have done better ...

Dumping a million bucks on SPY in March gets you damn close to 2x.
It’s not critical. If anything it shows op had a good enough understanding of the market and foresight to start then. That’s better than most. 

I have a watchlist from back in March when I knew near nothing about trading. My family and friends told me I was an idiot so I never invested. Now I keep it as a reminder to have conviction in my own ideas.
Good job, congratulations.
I know what has happened within the last year, my question is how well did he do since you know, it's so easy, right?
Except OP has 10,000% gains over that time period which I think is a bit higher than the average stock increase over that period.
Honest there’s so many different ways to scalp. I recommend checking out videos on YouTube. TraderTV has some great tutorials. But the way this guy (Kyle) scalps is that he does something called tick trading. So he buys and sells within seconds. Buying off the bid and selling on the offer almost instantly. If that’s something that works for your trading personality, then I’d recommend getting it a try. Personally, I found that it developed bad habits on my end and used a lot of “mental” capital. One thing you have to be aware of with tick trading is the fees. I believe he still uses ToS which is zero commission. If you don’t have zero commission and do tick trading, you’re gonna pay a lot of fees. Hope this helps man. Have a good one.
Lol he's literally been the most profitable during the past few weeks when everyone was crying about RED MARKETS
Also, bigger losses
Yep, bootstrapping your way up. It's not hard to make smaller profits in ES , but as your account goes up, the small profits get bigger, though to you, you are playing with alot of house money at a certain point which will allow you not to ignore risk, but push it out a bit more than you normally would in the correct situation. And seems like OP is really good at recognizing those situations.
All good looks like other people already called out this isn't legit. You cant trade that volume on tda. 

Maybe a few times but he isn't using this strat on a long (or medium) term basis.
Yeah I mean this is a day trading thread.  The amount of trades just seems insane, and you would have to do it full time 100%.  That and you better keep some cash lying around for Uncle Sam and whatever state you live in.  But I am assuming he knows that as a professional day trader, if he is an American.  If he lives in Luxembourg then he doesn't pay a dime I think.
Small quick profits. Essentially trying to hit the bid and selling as soon as it moves a few points.
How? Scalping is directional play
Crashes cause extreme volatility. Volatility is key to making a lot of money while day trading. Halts only last for 15 minutes anyway so that doesn't really affect things much
Ya I was speaking about Madaz. I've seen him on Twitter and his gains just seem surreal. Either he's the greatest trader on earth or something is up it seems like..
Probably in some cases... if everyone has the same strategy, it might become less effective...
[deleted]
>...it certainly makes it stupid easy...

> I didn’t say it’s easy...

>...it’s simple facts, it was very easy...
Okay then, put up some actual proof. Lets see some pics of your account progress. Also if you followed this guy at all you’d know that he primarily scalps small cap stocks. So it’s not like he made this with a few lucky plays. He grew this account steadily by being a great scalper/day trader. You don’t even know what ur talking about so why are you talking at all?
Because if you put ANYTHING in 3rd week of March 2020 you are up nicely. I say that having done so and just letting it sit. Not enough went in to turn it to a million but make due with what you have to enjoy gains in the long run.

How are you doing ? You rich?
You’re missing the point. Getting good at trading specifically is not supposed to be about making money. It’s about making the most money in the shortest amount of time. You’re number one goal is supposed to be freedom. Not sitting on your ass taking hundreds of trades a day. It’s about taking a few trades, trading for maybe two or three hours, making more than $1 million, and enjoying your life and having extraordinary freedom. Until you’re making that kind of money you’re not gonna ever understand and you’re just gonna be chasing a profit and you won’t be successful.
Ok plankton
True. There are many elements to trading. However, I  still maintain strategy and discipline is an art that is replicable and therefore can be learned through sharing and/observation. My second point is if you want people to listen to the wisdom you personally are bringing to the table, you may want to stop using phrases like ""half a brain"" and ""emotional"". That in and of itself is an emotional response to a valid question, and you may have a valid point, but ironically you just sound like a blowhard when you use emotional and judgmental language encouraging level headed and logical thinking.
Yeah? They still sit on the toilet, so they still use reddit
I mean yeah. The whole point of daytrading for me is to work from home and make money sometimes only working a few hours a day. Obviously I'm still in the learning stage and will start paper trading soon but ideally even with a million $ I'd have even more time to fuck around on reddit lol
I do nothing but sit at home now in days after doge went parabolic and I still use, post, respond and comment on reddit, millionaire or not I'm still the same broke guy that worked construction and likes staying up to date on shit or should I say current events since I'm a millionaire? By the way I had 33 million dogecoin and sold this year at .62 if ur wondering. Ps. I don't trade stocks grandpa.🎤
Yes I DEFINITELY would post it. Such a stupid argument. People who make a shit ton of money are bored off their asses. They are usually type a people who need to keep doing things to feel good. Like make videos or post things on Reddit. 

I seriously don’t understand why it’s so hard to believe someone could make money trading. You know if you study Medicine for 8 years you can print money at the hospital. We’ll study trading for 8 years and you can print money at an exchange. It’s no fucking different.
Exactly, it would be ultra easy to fake that screenshot
Yep. Somehow the dopamine messes with the analysis. That’s why a strategy that is written down in wood is typically easier to reproduce than some electro-chemical transistors in the brain. 

But even then, emotions can be dealt with. 

Logical reasoning fundamentally is separate from emotion. And logic rules are what strategies consist of.
Which shitcoin?
I’ve heard of bit coin, dogecoin, milf coin but never shitcoin where can I buy
Let me guess, filecoin?
Was this pure luck or was there some reasoning behind your purchase?
People have such a hard time reading clearly labeled graphs
And when I see a profit graph that looks linear I assume initial investment was significant.

If this started from ~$0 I would expect an exponential graph not one that roughly matches the overall market.
I agree, the best thing I’ve done for myself in my life is to listen to myself and have confidence to pursue what I believe in. It helps to educate yourself too along the way. 

Well said, that was the intentions of my comment, I guess maybe it was poorly worded, but essentially any good investor and trader with skills would have killed in 2020 and any novice traders would still have done reasonable.

A bear market, like potentially this year, is the real challenge. I’m not personally comfortable enough with putting and shorting my way to financial freedom so I’ll probably attempt a few but hold and wait.
this.  
dyor  
not just for trading.
Ignore these people, no stock besides fuckin gamestop did a 100x expectedly...
Thanks
Yes true, but if you have a good R/R ratio and high win percentage (like he does) then it still equals compounded earnings.  The only thing that’s different is that it’s harder to move bigger volume in and out of positions, so there’s a limit to your position size eventually.
I don’t see any losses on this graph. I’m so confused.
According to one of his previous posts, he's currently in Thailand and his has Thai accent, I'm assuming he's Thai, could also be dual citizens.

Ty for explanation, that is fucking crazy to do manually. I cannot imagine doing that honestly 

I'm a software developer for my job so I was thinking of making something to trade for me somehow but I don't trust myself/know where to start. Would you know?
Not if you're scalping option premiums.
To me he ticks all the boxes of someone that trades on sim claiming its live and makes money on the courses/chatroom.
That is absolutely unreal. I didn’t know anything about OP prior to making my half ass comments, which I will stand by on any other trader who made out half way decent, but I’ll check into his technique, from what you are saying, would he have potentially used a bot or anything to enhance his trades?
So unreal perhaps it isn’t real.
God I turned into Donald trump
I don’t follow him so probably why I didn’t know his method. I said again in my comment it takes skill not doubt, but again anything would have done well post March 2020, idk why that’s so hard for you to understand? 

I’m not here to swing dicks, or prove anything, just trying to pass on simple info for new traders that 2020 was a very very unique bull year.
You do know he never trades large caps? All his trades are closed out each day. 

So no he actually made his money go watch his youtube video

>Because if you put ANYTHING in 3rd week of March 2020 you are up nicely.

Maybe so, but you are likely not up 10,000% as OP is.
Options with a golf pun, but you are right, none of it matters.
Nope not yet 😂 getting there though.
Dude, the market is open 6.5 hours. I currently work 10 in the sun for far less than a million dollars. We're not the same. I totally support someone putting in the hours for the extraordinary FINANCIAL freedom, to enjoy life...
Damn straight
I don't care. If someone gets offended by that I would use that as a early warning sign they're far too sensitive to handle what the market is gonna give them.
Double here here
Yeah I never got that argument this whole idea that rich people dont use reddit.

You think rich people don't want to use social media or stay up on current events? On what planet lol?
Apt
Wow, well done, what did you buy them for?
Sure . Funny very few people talk about loses . I’m sure you always win . And your a millionaire. Why not do live real time videos , how ever you can do that . I’m old so I wouldn’t know .  Send me a real time video sure you can do that now that your a millionaire……
So a year later let’s see , not so many AMC POSTS OR GME. I just hit a million is securities . So I haven’t posted or been on this site in a long time. I keep a quick log on all the silly things people post or tell me in my travels .
The latest one was xrp if I took the advice I would be down 20%. The market is the market it doesn’t always move the way one might think . Covid made people money , and they invested in a market that just went up . Too bad no one gets back to me about how the last year or so have been . I hope your making lots of money .
Exactly
Harmony.

No joke, my friend made [shitcoin](https://www.dogshit.network/). I’m definitely selling if you are buying.
Safemoon, sell out before it pyramids. You could go 1000% before then. Or pop and -90%.
Harmony ONE I bought at 40 sats when bitcoin was around 10k.
Yes and no.

I had watched it for a long time before I jumped in. Bought low, and had forgotten about it until I heard people mentioning it like they were shocked.
For real though. The ""but but but... bEaR MaRkEt"" period has literally been his most profitable xD
Happy cake day!
Its incredible considering his 800k of losses during this time
The graph just represents his gains over the time period, it’s not a graph of all gains and losses. Losses are noted below - nearly $879k
I don't know.  I think it depends if the U.S. has a tax treaty with the country.  It can get very complicated.  Normally you would pay taxes in the U.S. and get a credit back from your home country, although again the rules are different for different countries.  Being that he is foreign he would probably have to submit a w-8 to whatever broker he was using so they may end up withholding it from him at year end.  Not sure that it applies to capital gains though.  I'd use some of the cash to retain a tax attorney in the U.S. thats for sure.  Because they will want their piece if they can get it.
That’s awesome, factor in US <-> Thailand—the exchange rates, purchasing power parity /  cost of living—and the payoff must’ve been much greater for OP. 

Even if super-taxed, OP earned more from home than ER docs throughout COVID.
Fellow software dev here, have had the same thought. I looked into a few api docs before I thought, “this is what the big trading corps do”

I’d be willing to hack something together though. I’d throw a couple grand at an experiment
I’ve bedn practicing a similar strategy with paper trading snd I’m pretty good at it but I’m way too chickenshit to try it with real money only way I’ve squirmed out a couple times was having enough buying power to average down a huge loss fun as hell with fake money though
Im a software developer and run a prop trading shop with all automated trading strategies. There is nothing too complex. I run 4 different strategies including opening gap fades & follows for the first 15 minutes of trading, a pair deviation trading strategy on stocks that are cointegrated, a 0DTE credit spread strategy on leveraged ETFS and a pivot scalping system similar to what op is doing. I started 5 years ago and worked as a dev at an investment firm prior so I had some knowledge going into trading. To get started pick a broker, develop a simple mean reverting or momentum trend strategy and run it, you will improve as you go along. My systems place close to 1,000 orders a day with over 250,000 being traded a day in stocks and crypto. There are a ton of good books and also learning about market microstructure is also helpful.

They actually already exists, and you can purchase them if you are trusting. I don't have enough money to trust lol
How?
Ok so if you don’t know, why are you making assumptions? And again if it was so easy, let’s see some pictures of your account statements. So many people talk big but very few show the amount of success and transparency that this guy does. So I just don’t like when faceless dickheads on the internet with no showing of any of their accomplishments add their unneeded 2 cents.
Do you have the link by chance?
what about now bro
Depends on which market you’re trading. But the market I trade is not open for 6.5 hours. Neither is the New York Stock Exchange.  I have my freedom and I can’t stress what I’m saying enough.  Look at my profile.  I almost never comment on here.  Might do it a few times every few months.  My mentor was a blue collar laborer for 15 years.  I can assure you, he’s never tried to treat like this either. Discipline is freedom. Over-trading is not the way.  If the legitimate professionals don’t do it, what makes you think it’s the right way?
Bottom line, without the strategy, and the handle of emotions, you'll not make much.  No good strat and education?  Prepare to make very little.  Good strat and poor emotions?  Prepare to make very little.  They go hand in hand.  Some strats need more discipline and emotion than others.  No hard in asking about the strat, especially since this poster shows results all the time...for a reach-around?  For congrats?  For what...
I have a saying at work whenever I work with C-Suite: ""everybody poops""
Everything follows cycles. From decade to minutes you can spot them. Im still waiting for 2025. I sunk everything into crypto and was up 100fold. never sold, cause I'm an asshole. Lol. Anyway, I don't see me stopping reddit if I get rich. Im not a millionaire but I make 3 times what I used to at my job now, and still post. Haha. No but for real, why would I stop going online just because I have a big house and a nice bmw? Congrats on your success, Ill be there in 2025. See you then. :)
Arguably not a shitcoin, but it sure did hit, didn't it?
Nice
Ask your mom. (I'm so sorry... But it was right there.)

Brilliant!
Not a bad turn around, nice!
Congrats!
Not really, the best traders aren't necessarily better at making money than the average person, just better at losing it
Just backtest it with a paper trading account first.
I was thinking do a fantasy portfolio for months before I give it real money. 

Tbh I'm most sketched by all the oauth and password storing and everything I'd probably do horribly unsafely. 

Now that I think about it idk why I've been thinking that... I'll just manually give the account money lmao, as long as I don't teach it what shorting is I can only lose what I put in manually...

I should work on this hm. Idk anything about TA tho, I was thinking make a thing that buys shit social media talks about, but it's a lot of filtering if I want something I actually trust. There are hella websites analyse reddit stock info, so I'm hoping I can use their api LOL, idk if I'm being wishful. 

I know there are so many websites for it so it feels silly to recode that just so my bot can understand the info and then actually act on what they've already solved. I guess worse case I web scrape the info from those websites...

Shit idk what I'm doing I'm in my young 20s lmfao
Another software dev here who worked for NYSE Euronext in the financial trading department, we made feed handlers and algos that would do trades for people, we sold these to JP Morgan and Goldman sachs and so. Writing one of these algorithms and having it be successful requires a team of about 5 -10 mathematical geniuses and about 20 autistics programmers, shits high level.

Oh they definitely exist aha, but I don't wanna pay. Plus this would be good for my resume lol
You can buy and sell the same option calls or puts at the same strike price to make profit (as long as the buyer is there, which is why I only scalp on high volume stocks). With the benefit of not having to worry Theta decay.
Sounds like someone is salty they lost money during the greatest bull market of all time
Maybe that's the difference here. I'm not striving to do it the ""right way"" according to others; rather a better way for myself is all.. I love sharing our perspectives though, this is cool
I’m not trying to be snarky, how long have you been a dev? Late twenties enterprise dev myself. Oauth and token exchange and storing credentials doesn’t have to be sketchy 

I was thinking something similar but also including a running list of the tickers pennystocksDD, WSB, And this sub talks about most and investing proportionally there with a trailing % stop in the top talked tickers
Yep. I figured. I know enough about this field and have been around the block enough to know my idea smelled

That being said, I’d still be interested to just get my hands on but really only for that purpose. Hence why I used the word experiment

Edit: am drunk and made some spelling grammatical errors
I’ve only had 3 days this year where I was in the negative. My focus is on risk management. None of my trades risk more than 2% of the account. I withdraw all profits at the end of the week and keep churning the same account balance. It did take me several blown accounts and years of trial and error to build these systems and processes. My profits are enough to pay me a salary of more than I was making as a senior engineer at this point.
How do you sell it for a profit if the stock price is not moving??
I think they just mean they know some coding, that's it lol
Yeah my first job out of college fucked me for 1.5 years so I barely programmed, I actually didn't learn shit for real. Finally got out of there and got this new job like 2 months ago and I was dealing with that and it is fine/not sketch, it's just a lot of power to trust myself with lol .

My 1st job was non experience, just a resume booster, so I sneaked my way into this job and it's hard dude
Very cool. Any recommended books? Also how do you set up your exit logic? Is it a trailing stop loss? Fixed limit order for set period of time and then stop loss?
No profit if it doesn't move, but if you're scalping the goal is to find the swings. If you can find a stock where the Bid/Ask isn't too far apart, and you see the numbers fluctuate to your comfort level, I see it as you get $1 for every 1 price tick, per contract. So, buy 10, you're watching your money drip and rise $10 every time that premium moves.
They explained in another post that they’re employed as a dev, but are very early on in their career
If you guys are software engineers, and not in a FAANG or top tech company yet, the quickest path forward for y'all for good $$ is to leetcode your asses off for a month (or more if you suck at it) and get a $200k+ yr job.

For late twenties dude you could make $400k+ if you land a senior level job.

For reference, I am 34 yo Sr SDE and pulling in $400k this year, I started my SDE career at 25 with shit companies though.

Once you get your big dick software job then build your trading bot with a fun money bankroll.
I’m making mid 300 as a backend lead now (EM) after following a similar path and I 1000% agree with this advice. Sage wisdom friend

I could make more, but I really dig the company I’m at and the benefits are hard to beat

To be honest I’m finding it hard to allocate time to pet projects because I’m really enjoying spending the time I didn’t have before on video games and my gf/our pets
Meh I don't need to grind that hard. I'm happy with my salary and the job I'm at has really good growth. 

Life isn't all money, I've got more than enough, I just want to capitalize on what I have and what I'm doing with it before focussing on getting a higher salary. It's all the same strategy to invest you know what I mean?
I mean.. you aren't wrong but you ARE on a day trading reddit sub :)
Yeah, for day trading. Not to max out my salary asap"						
anyone else?	2097.0	https://i.redd.it/rdmfrmj5qtn61.jpg	"Nobody will even listen long enough for me to tell them all I know.
🖐🏾 at some point real soon people that know that you are in crypto will know you are wealthy
Most of them just ask how much i invested so i divide by 10.

But my mother does not believe that number for one second ;)
When you want to help with adoption but you’re also into crypto because you’re pragmatic..
I get that. Somehow i feel ashamed to tell the real amount. Not that it's a huge amount, but most people still see it as gambling your money away. And i don't really want to explain to them why i believe in it because then i look like a brainwashed shill (in their eyes). People in general are highly uninformed about blockchain, they only see BTC as an unstable alternative way to pay for things on the internet.

Also i don't want to be like, ""this is it guys, the golden ticket"" because they might take my advice, and when shit goes bad they'll blame me. I'm young and single so i can take the risk. I don't want to be the guy who ruined my married 40+ coworkers saving's.

Also, i don't want their stupid comments about me losing all my money when a bear market comes. ""I told you it was a bubble dude"".

So yea, i try to keep it to myself. Even if i kinda want to share my excitement about the technology and monetary possibilities.
The trick is keep buying and never sell

Nice 😎🖖
Keep stackin' those sweet sweet sats[&alts]👍🌙
At a certain point, I’m pretty sure most of us in some ways are “smarter” than the people we still can’t get to open their eyes. And the fact that we are getting excited you’d think they’d catch on. 

Quite the psychological manipulation has occurred on the older generations for sure. Survival 101.
The only people that know I'm in crypto in real life are my parents and my brother. No one else needs to know what's in my bank account. It's not a security issue, it's just tacky
Real
Yes 😂
You expect me to admit to that?   In public??    /s

Haha so true. I’ve been really investing time in DD on $PKF, anyone heard of them? New company to help devs code in a WiX type of way.. meaning very simple way. They are backed by a heavy team and their advisory group is crazy! Au21, duckdao, mantra dao, x21x the list goes on and on. Community saying this is a 50x coin. It’s already up 10x.   @Polkafoundry
haha true enough, in deep
This right here. But this is also how we know we got in at the right time. Eventually they will see and come around.
I would listen xd

lmfao I always feel like I have all this information to vomit on people, usually I put up a splatter guard.

I'll tell them in depth when i'm swimming in my millions, a few years from now.

Ha, that's kind of you. Tougher to type than to talk (esp. since I'm on mobile), but if you have some burning questions, first ask google, second feel free to ask! In crypto, you can read info 24/7 and still fall behind, so always ask questions and always question the answers you find.
me to, I dont mind learning from someone who has been long enough in the game and avoid making the same mistakes. That’s gold
Lmao you're alright. 50/50 BTC /ETH, small automatic buys like you're paying a bill, only put in what you can afford. Do this for 5 years while you plan your retirement. TBH that's it. Boring, but effective.

There some alts to dabble in but as you've seen those can be dangerous. DPI is an index of DeFi coins I like that's a pretty safe way to get exposure to a wide range without having to drop a fortune on gas fees for 10 token buys.
Yeah, i hear you & two of my very good friends to whom i told the real numbers just want to give me money so i invest for them hehe

I'm kinda new to this too. but my best friend is not so i teamed up with him !

But i am obsessed now tho, can't even scroll normal memes or wasted time on the net pointlessly anymore ;)
Sent you a chat message If you’ve got any time to reply!
What will dogecoin do on the moon and why are they going to the moon in the first place ?
This is so true. I just dipped my toes in the water after two weeks of reading this shit morning and night. I still don’t even know what the best exchange is. I started on Coinbase pro, but they don’t even offer Luna. What exchanges are people here using? Also, I have a cold wallet coming in two weeks, but until then what hot wallet is popular? Right now I just have BTC, ETH and ADA. Good hot wallet to hold it till my wallet gets here from France?
DCA, HOLD, repeat till you’re happy with the amount. Maybe consider selling after that.
I hope your not *only* holding doge my good man, I mean you do you but, I'd be careful about that strategy.

Nevertheless, good to hear on finding crypto friends, always good to have a sounding board for your investments, hopefully he's a good influence and not a bad one.

And lol I've been in the game since 2017 so this point I'm pretty numb to it all.
It's a meme, so if it moons it moons for meme reasons. I dont bother to speculate on it, the fundamentals are nonexistant.
Uniswap is the best exchange ;)

But, expensive for now... but V3 and optimism scaling are coming sooner than people realize.
Well said!
Hehehe thanks for caring :) No i sold all my doge non sense, it did get me into crypto so i am grateful for that :) But as soon as i started educating myself i moved away from doge!

2017, 2018 So you lived through the great crypto crash & live to tell the tale ?

Mostly altcoins now : dot, atom, link, ada, algo, fcl, htr !

\+ some eth

I love the Polkadot ecosystem so far ! Gavin Wood built something strong there i think!

But i am just learning as i'm still new :)

Thanks for taking the time :)
Ahah I was only joking :p! What do u think about beam ?
Thanks for the insight, I’ll check it out. Have you used Binance.us? I assume that’s the only place to get BNC which seems like one of the premier coins.
That's awesome man! Always big respect to anyone who learns and grows and it sounds like your doing a lot of it. 

I'm still kicking myself for not getting involved in dot earlier but it's hard to stay on top of everything and I got burned pretty bad in 2017  yoloing on alts so the ptsd kinda holds me back. It's water under the bridge tho, nobody can ride every big run up and I try and remind myself that in the grand scheme of things I'm still doing great. Certainly a head of all the ppl who don't hold any crypto haha

I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors good sir and that all of your coins moon and you buy as many lambos you want haha.

Cheers mate
DOGE is actually doing insane rn
Haven't heard much of it sorry.
No, my on/off ramp is Coinbase. I try to use it as little as possible, I strongly prefer decentralized services. If someone can seize or move my coins without my permission, that's not where I want my coins.
Thank you :)
Its crazy how many new crypto's come out! And i guess the ones we hear about are always the ones that mooned!
Fomo is hard thing to battle when you're new ;)
And the (i should have) part as well but i guess you get better at handling those with time, i sure hope so !
Same to you, i really appreciate that you're taking the time to answer :)
Wishing you all the best as well, may your many upcoming lambos make you smile ;)

Cheers
I am fully aware ;)

The amount of people that don’t know shit about crypto in this thread is hilarious. Holding til $1 is a one way ticket to reckt city. If you all want to pump in crypto, why are you pumping a coin with the highest circulating supply? It’ll take 128billiom dollar market cap to see a dollar. 
So stupid.

I know this sub hates XSPA for it's past antics, justifiably so.  But it hit rock bottom at 1.18 just 3 weeks ago, and has organically recovered to about 2.28 before all of the craziness this week started adding to the volatility.  It's an incredibly highly shorted stock, with nothing but good news for weeks now, new locations, partnerships etc.  It's a solid target for punishing shorts, decent stock with the potential of an actual future.  It doesn't have the nostalgia that GameStop or Nokia do, but it's already up .40 in pre-market and just this morning with very little momentum was able to squeeze to 3.70.  I think we may see that strategy repeat today or next week, combined with natural growth.  It won't go parabolic like GME did, but gains are gains.  I'm all for it.
What platform can I use to buy TODAY?
This guy lol
RH won't let you buy dodgecoin
Im alr3ady in!!!!!!
Dogecoin
Doge is great! That and everyone can afford it. Good fun for everyone with Hopefully a good return.
Everyone can afford dogecoin. It we play this right we can all be millionaires.

The swimmer in green is me opening a buy and sell in one pair and then waiting forever as price does not move so I just sit in the middle with -+$0.01 P/L the whole time.

I'm not losing and yet I'm not winning...
just learn institutional trading :p
I have a 100% win rate with counter trend trades. 3/3 ain't much but still 100% win rate.
Very good !
if the professional one is doing this, we should have learnt something from them. This is a great lesson, isn't it?
u/savevideo
trading counter trend is the way to go, stop listening to gurus who tell you trading reversal is bad and why u should just follow the trend, u buy the dip or you're late
Almost correct!! My account get sucked by pump and get stuck under water.. can’t even come up!!😩
Profit is profit!
I hate the feeling....:)
Did you want it to? Lol
As a swimmer you tighten your stuff so it doesn’t come off. You normally encounter the most force on impact so it’s the technically the same force as a regular pool dive and swim

NFP big cuck times indeed
Huh?"						
Yellen spoke too soon. Had to frame this.	55.0	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/w5xnw0	"The ’crisis’ have now gone from once in lifetime, to once every decade, to once every 2 years.

The post 1971 monetary system has been an absolute failure for everyone except the top 0.01%.
It’s not a financial crisis we’re going through. It’s a class war. It’s simple math, the Feds know where all the money went and have the authority to reverse it. Stock market is up 75% since the start of the pandemic. Bezos and Musk are in a small peepee race to the moon while most of Americans are watching their savings get wiped out and millennials are forever priced out of real estate. 

Tax the rich. 
Tax churches.
Stop lobbyist bribes. 

It all comes down to money and math. They can figure it out but don’t want to.
In whose lifetime? Because it’s not me I’m worried about, it’s the children.
Do u think she's wearing underwear in the second pic? 😆
This isn't a financial crisis.
I mean, she could not have predicted COVID…
Hilarious.
She means her life time I think
It’s here. Go away
What has she gotten right in my lifetime?
If I worked like she does, I would have been fired a long time ago.  Transient?  I don't think she even thought this.
Who would have thought the Jimmy Carter junior would have ran for president and won?
The only thing dumber  is tax corporations which are not really taxable as they see tax as a cost of input and offset it with higher prices that WE pay.
Nobody would dare tax a black church. They could directly preach about specifics of who to vote for and allow those candidates to come and speak directly... wait... they already do that. On the other hand evangelical and those terrible faithful catholics... now members of those groups deserve nothing but scorn and derision. Got it. Woke much?
Cool it with the antisemitism.
It's not a financial crisis anyway. It's just a bad time to buy a house or have relied on Bitcoin recently. 

Interest rates up might at least drop excessive house prices a bit. 

I agree on the taxes and definitely lobbying. Churches use income to publicly lobby. Even if they're not directly telling you their choice by name from the pulpit, the community is well aware of the political preference. Charity funds get used directly for lobbying though organizations.
Taxation is theft.

Your version of society is fucked.
Tax churches? Who do you think is caring for the poor and providing a safety net? The government?  Lol. The largest provider of hospitals and education and social programs are churches. Don't blame them.
Stop with this tax the rich shit. You think any of that tax revenue will go to us? No, it will all go to replacing the millions of dollars of military equipment we lost in Afghanistan.

What we should be saying is:
“Stop taxing the middle class.”

If we didn’t have to pay 40% in taxes, perhaps we could actually afford a house.”
I just threw up in my mouth
From what she's saying she's has some kind of atrologer like ability to make forecasts. 

She can't predict shit.
Good point. Whose lifetimes? The de facto is hers aka boomer's lifetimes.
[deleted]
Black churches host singularly one party to preach from their pulpit and NOBODY balks at that. Interesting.
In your version of society, where do shared amenities come from?
We’re probably talking about different things. There are Churches and then there are CHURCHES. The ones I’m talking about are the larger ones in which the leadership have private jets, billion dollar mansions and push political agendas. They’re not doing anything for their congregations except collecting their money. I agree on the points you made. Thanks.
[deleted]
You don't know the movie I'm referring to do u?
Fun fact... not in usa
Is it interesting? Because I haven't seen anyone say, ""tax churches that push politics, except black churches!"" If you're talking about people reacting to particular messaging coming from churches, then that should be pretty obvious: Evangelicals want to control everyone else and limit their freedoms, black Protestants don't want to be disproportionately oppressed, incarcerated, and killed. 

Evangelicals push for bans on abortion, gay marriage and relationships, sodomy (which means much more than anal sex), contraception, pornography, alcohol sales (most cities have Sunday bans, some are completely dry), and marijuana, to name a few rights they want to take or keep away from everyone. What rights are black churches trying to take away from you and everyone else?
They don't come from stealing people's shit via threat of force which enables the parasitic class including the central bank that prints the fiat to have guaranteed funding who then create a mother fucking business model out of perpetual war and chaos for profit, globally, that's for cotdamn sure.

I know, you feel roads are worth the cost of all of that war and chaos. I disagree.

And before you try and back track or try and play your magically delicious statist mental gymnastics horse shit... here ya go:

""We have now sunk to a depth at which the restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men... Do remember that dishonesty and cowardice always have to be paid for.  Don't imagine that for years on end you can make yourself the boot-licking propagandist of any régime, and then suddenly return to mental decency.   Once a whore, always a whore.""

Once a whore, always a whore.

Edit: gotta love when you wreck the shit out of a bootlicking propagandist and they delete their account rather than attempting to respond. Happens to me often.

Edit2: nm, the user blocked me because I called him out as a boot licker, which is the term they recommended I google. Yes, I already knew you are a boot licker. No need to google.
Well you cannot choose which ones you tax. I understand your frustration. There was a guy back in the 13th century  who said  ""preach the gospel every day,and if ABSOLUTELY necessary,use words"". This is how good wins out.
You clearly don’t live in the Bay Area :).
Basic Instinct.
Google “Bootlicker”.
Calm down your name calling is not a discussion . It's a weapon of mental midgets .
But you can. It’s just numbers. Say ANY “Church” with $500k or more in donations per year (I.e. not the local, congregation-focused churches you’re talking about) get taxed at corporate rates. Simple.
So target the catholic church; the number one provider of hospitals, shelters, clinics, soup kitchens, drop in childcare centers, long term care centers, universities and international aid. Yep... this church is truly an enemy of the state. And who will pick up where they leave off because they will have to curtail these programs.
Yep. They’re not making any money in healthcare. Poor poor Catholic Church… /s 🤦‍♂️
So soup kitchens, adoption and drop in Care centers, write offs for medical bills, soup kitchens,and international aid means nothing to you? Obviously you have never been in a catholic hospital. The big one in billings is constantly writing off care but can we risk a non profit making a penny on those things.  I think your hatred is definitely outweighing your critically thinking.
WTF?! You act like there’s no corruption in religion or the Catholic Church or, I don’t know, POLITICS? JFC. Pull your head out. Billions of working class taxes could be alleviated by taxing people for their hobbies. Choose the church to give your money to, fine. Why there is an exemption?! Churches are like beer companies spending billions to market that they gave thousands to a charity. Wake up."						
Would having or using a Blockchain be the perfect way for a charity to be analyzed for transparency and to make sure it's funds are being used properly?	112.0	https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/t5f5xy/would_having_or_using_a_blockchain_be_the_perfect/	"Love the thinking here. Being able to demonstrate a donors contribution in a trustworthy, transparent manner would be huge. 

We’d need to see a rise in stablecoin usage to really see this play out as the trail would be over as soon as a non-profit exchanges their crypto for fiat.
Would love to see charitable projects connected to geographic areas with their own token and minting process. So, local businesses and people could finance infrastructure changes that benefit everyone in that region long-term, and the minting of that token is only given out lightly among contributors and largely once deliverables are achieved.

It would be especially cool if this sorta thing could scale up and down depending on the size of the project, and were constructed to be pegged to similar tokens/ projects.


So, like a neighborhood project of fixing all the potholes by the nearby highway, is suggested and pegged to larger projects of renewing county signage.
In my opinion yes! I have thought about this extensively and plan to implement a solution in the future.The only issue is that outgoing transactions will not have a clear destination. For example if I send x BTC to someone from the charity’s account, it will not be clear to who that money is being sent. For all anyone knows it can be an account I control. For true transparency, all ingoing and outgoing transactions would need to have a short description available somewhere on the web, but again you will need to be able to trust those descriptions as an external party.
Yes, but I think the best case would be charity DAOs so that governance tokens could be issued to holders and all donations of funds would need to be approved via governance consensus. 

So basically:
Charity type DAO says they are for cancer research
Companies who were doing cancer research can propose for help and they have to supply their plan on how the money they are requesting will be used
Governance members review proposal
Based on relevance to DAO mission statement, solidity of plan and team to receive funds, etc governance members approve or deny 
Money can then be moved. 

As other users have brought up just having blockchain doesn’t remove the embezzlement factor we see in current charities like Susan g komen because you don’t know where the money is going and for what purposes. That’s why the DAO becomes an important part for transparency sake
Meh. A lot more to transparency than just seeing where money is sent. & banks have great transparency as it is. Not sure this is very applicable. 

- worked in cash for year +, been through 3-4 audits
I don't think so, like unless everyone is using the blockchain you might track how much money the charity got, but not where it spent it.
The use of blockchain is a way to record anything verified 
And put In a box  once box is filled  box is closed and  hashed. Now its permanent
Smart contracts could take a lot of the burden out of a charity's financials I would think. Rather than annual financial audits to ensure funds are directed as intended, it could happen real-time. For example, earmarking a donation to a certain use (btw - better to not earmark your donations, let charities direct where needed!)
Recently, there was actually a blockchain project that was able to do this. Utrust put zero fees on any transactions coming to and from Ukraine. This helped immensely and since Utrust does KYC, it was surely going to the right places.
Blockchain could help a charity to provide proof of impact imo. A crude example:

* A charity raises funds to ship containers of flour to a famine-stricken part of the world.
* Each container load is divided into 1000 bags of flour represented by ERC1155 NFTs
* When you donate you buy one of these NFTs (representing a bag of flour)
* Once the 1000 NFTs are sold, the full container ships
* Each container has a sensor allowing you to track it's journey from A to B online
* Relevant ID data is attached to the NFT you bought, accessible via an online portal
* This includes a map (like airplane flight path maps) showing where your container is
* When it arrives a photo is added showing the container and its ID
* Photos are added showing the flour's distribution from that container to end users

With GPS, blockchain and NFTs we can see our support goes to its intended recipients.
There will always be a gateway between crypto and real life use. Whilst this would ensure that the funds reach a destination on the blockchain, what happens with them after they leave is still beyond that scope . So it would certify a part of the cash flow but not all of it
Interesting to see this point. As of right now I am working on this very proposition. As it stands we've been able to make an escrow smart contract to enable NGO's to utilize funds - donated in crypto - by fulfilling requirements. The hard part is still the proof of work (not as in the consensus mechanism) but to ensure compliance on the NGO side. And as it stands right now - it does not seem sustainable to host this rich media on the blockchain but instead off-chain. We've been looking into IFPS to have the security aspect and decentralization hightened instead of traditional cloud solutions. But we're still a ways off to realize a workable prototype as it requires several architectures. A very real issue in this space is also what are the technical competencies of the NGOs and potential donors? Blockchain, as a technology, comes with many benefits out of the box but implementing them as a holistic service for the humanitarian/philantropic sector is still hard.
[removed]
Blockchain technology has indeed made these transactions more secure and transparent. That's one of the reasons that even off-chain ventures like real estate have moved their platforms onto blockchain like Bricktrade. Aside from the transparency, the decentralization also allows you to get into fractionalized properties for a considerably cheaper price of £500. There may be some loopholes around it, but this is definitely a more secured way to start charity funding.
This question is actually completed unrelated to Blockchain. If you took the word ""Blockchain"" out of your entire post, it'd still be the same: ""How can we track the cash flow of charities?"". Your post simply asks ""Maybe blockchain?"".
Lets start donating fir war casualties
Blockchain unfortunately does not solve incorrect or malicious data entry, which is much more of an issue than transparency of the data entered.
How about supported by different blockchains? KOLnet is one of it. You can earn  by staking KOL and it's perfect mix of DeFi and Martech. Pay a visit on their page.
I believe so, yes. This sounds like a superb implementation of Blockchain technology.
Why just charities? Would shareholders not want this permanence and transparency as well?
No way. How would corrupt politicians fund their corruption with all that transparency and accountability.
[removed]
Good point. What about charities like unchain that are partnering with web 3 projects like DEIP to assist the Ukraine situation? Would that count as charities on a blockchain?
This is really cool especially the last part. It allows people to bypass the government/ local municipality and directly find contractors willing to do public sector work. Those contractors would be financed privately (as donations) and everything can be governed under a DAO.

I've been thinking about this for a while and there are certainly a lot of hindrances, but in countries where there is little hope in the public sector this concept should be able to work (from a strict paractical perspective minus all the bureaucracy and paperwork)

Edit: only reason im mentioning this because this pothole thing you mentioned is very relatable haha. The roads where im from are super neglected that its up to local members of the community to fix them and bear the costs.
CityCoins do something similar but in a more straightforward way
And what about if those addresses have to be public who's holding them? And only those allready known addresses are allowed to receive btc?

Even with all that it may very well warrant the existence of a ERC20 coin/token or something, but to be valued as a top 5 coin... well... Let say I'm not convinced it is actually worth that.

It’s listed on the international association for cryptological research website under “accepted papers”:

https://www.iacr.org/conferences/crypto2017/acceptedpapers.html

It’s number 71
[removed]
From my perspective nobody really knows why it's that popular (same with some others like XEM or Ripple)
I’ll tell you this, from what research I did, and the team behind it, I thought they could POTENTIALLY have something great so I threw $100 at it when it was .02. If you were to tell me it would shoot up 60x 2 months after that, I’d have told you that you were an idiot. 

It was an extremely long term hodl for me when I bought in, but if I told you that I didn’t cash out 75% at the ath, I would be lying. 
I did a deep dive and honestly couldn't figure it out and I spend way too much time reading on this kind of stuff.

The founder is from the original Ethereum project, but no longer associated with it. From what I understand this project uses the Ethereum classic framework ETC (not ETH).

It seems like a think-tank for crypto but I have yet to see an actual product. I do know that Zencash recently partnered with one of their subsidiaries to scale the technology up, but that is more of a research effort to locate the appropriate technology, not actually using their platform.

Someone with more knowledge feel free to correct me.
My take on ADA right now is that its a platform project that is going through the most critical forms of peer review(stress tests) they can find. That being said, I think its a bit overvalued right now because there is no product or real world use case at this point in time, the current valuation appears to be coming from potential the project has based on how much work is going into making sure they have it right before they launch. Basically they want to have a platform that can actually handle full mainstream adoption before its launch based on what they've learned through failures and successes other projects have endured. Out of all of the projects I've researched, I'm most impressed with cardano's attempt at making a scalable platform with a well planned governance model, so far. Highly suggest checking out any of the IOHK youtube account's videos with Charles Hoskinson, he does a great job explaining and is probably the reason for the current valuation, but once you watch a few it may help you understand.
Here’s Dan Larimer’s peer review:

/u/ethereumcharles
Have you ever met those people who always say that their opinions are based on science? ....But you know damn well that they get all their information from Facebook and major news networks. 

That’s what this is. 
I'm interested in this as well. It has the same development team behind it as Ethereum, which you would hope would count for something, but it always seems kind of funny when people buy these ERC20 tokens which at some point at a later stage they hope will be converted to a native token.
It's arguably the most transparent team with the most detailed information on their technology pretty much everywhere on their three different websites ( IOHK, Emurgo, Cardano), with an insane Github activity for the technical details...IOHK are also very active on Youtube for the lazy readers. And yet some keep complaining.
 
I am shocked at the poor level of investigation shown by some redditors
Have you read the whitepaper?
Are you sure you are not being a bit disingenuous? It seems hard to miss their fleet of white papers and presentations at renowned universities.
A few things on this.
* Cardano smart contracts won't need to run on the entire network and will therefore be much more scalable.
* Cardano is engineering their smart contract platform to allow for development in any language.
* ETH smart contracts will run on the Cardano platform.

edit: apparently formatting doesn't work here?
Cardano, an ETH V2? ETH doesn't have nor plan to have any high-assurance code like Cardano, as far as I know of. High-assurance code is used in life-or-death situations, by aerospace manufacturers like the NASA or Being / Airbus. Ideal if you don't want the whole financial system to fail due to bugs if you ask me... I would strongly suggest that you listen to Duncan Coutts detailing it.

Also, Cardano will soon have quantum resistant signatures, and a treasury model amongst others brilliant features, in a code written in Haskell, which means, as you very well said, that there will be far less bugs as this functional language eliminates a whole class of errors.
Yep this. Considering devs have tons of upgrades planned for ETH network, I just can't take ""this will replace Ethereum"" hype seriously. 

Maybe if they have a working product that's proven to be better then ETH significantly and accumulated legit partners, then yeah. I'll consider it. But from what I'm seeing, the ship has already sailed for them considering many other big companies are already offering working blockchain products TODAY (MS Azure, IBM+Hyperledger) 


It certainly has the highest ratio of marketcap to nonexistence...

Doesn’t mean it doesn’t have potential though. Any protocol that can actually scale with high assurance has the opportunity to be absolutely massive. 
I actually did read through those -- but both the white paper and the 'why cardano' section are all about their new version of proof of stake. I didn't find concrete details about the coin itself however. Perhaps I missed something but if you've seen somewhere a description of how they intend to deal with scaling problems for instance, I would love to hear it.
Plenty of details here, and all easily accessible. I struggle to see how people say 'they can't find much detail' about cardano. From my limited experience in crypto, it is one of the most well documented, open & transparent projects I have come across.
Thanks but I've actually gone through that paper and as far as I could tell it was *all* about their new version of Proof of Stake. Aside from the fact that it will use this type of PoS, I didn't see anywhere details of how the coin itself is meant to operate. If you know, I would really appreciate a summary of some kind, or if you could quote from where you saw it in the paper.
This is a shorter, also helpful video: https://youtu.be/Do8rHvr65ZA
NEM has a consensus algorithm called Proof of Importance, I thought it was interesting to read about but I don't see how they're bringing much novelty either.
Ripple? Really? It's pretty popular because they have actual partnership with renowned banks and companies. 
What? XEM and Ripple both have multiple business partnerships and a working platform. They are nothing like Cardano.
Here is your first real-world use-case for the Cardano blockchain. You should have done more research

https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/cardano-blockchains-first-use-case-proof-university-diplomas-greece/
Here is the IOHK response on this article ( you should know that Dan Larimer hates Charles Hoskinson for context). 

As you can see, IOHK/ Cardano is in a league of its own.

https://iohk.io/blog/on-the-ouroboros-design-how-rigour-and-engineering-are-essential-for-critical-infrastructure/?utm_content=buffer14679&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer
But that review, just like all the material I've found so far, only covers their Proof of Stake algorithm. I'm wondering about all the other details of the coin. PoS is only one component.

Do you know how it works?
[deleted]
I did mention it actually. If you read my question again, I referred to their new take on proof of stake, which is what ouroboros is.

My problem is that aside from the details on PoS (Ouroboros) I see no other details on how the coin will actually work. Is it bitcoin with PoW switched out for Proof of Stake? Or is the design completely different?

If you know then I would really appreciate a quick summary.

why do you feel the need to talk like this? are you even aware of how much of a retarded shill you sound like?
Yes indeed. I'm not writing it off technically. I'm saying that the current price is unlikely a valuation worth its state of development (as much as correct pricing can be determined for any crypto project).

But theoretical scaling is proposed for all coins. The solutions vary, but since we only have two networks that are highly stressed in a real world setting (BTC and Eth), no coin can actually claim it has 'solved' the scaling issue.
Wait where did you see something about scaling? That's what I'd really like to read about. Everything that I've come across so far only deals with their Proof of Stake algorithm.
Because their version of proof of stake will allow to fix scaling problems, the more people will use Cardano the more it can scale. But it is still in early development. 

Anyway i think that I'm not the best person to explain things like this, in /r/CardanoCoin there are a lot of people who can answer properly to all your questions. Consider creating a post there. 
Would you say that you have a good understanding of it? Would you mind providing a quick summary?

I have been through both the whitepaper and the why cardano sections and found implementation details about the coin itself to be scarce. Instead I found a huge amount of documentation about their new version of Proof of Stake. But of course PoS is just one aspect of a cryptocurrency.
Because you weren't able to provide a summary to the OP. It seems pretty much no one is.
Yeah I know it’s only one of their papers, they have like 5 papers. Unfortunately I don’t know if they’ve submitted all their papers to conventions like this I’ve only found this one link. 
And you know people that use XEM or Ripple? 
Could've pretty much used any blockchain for that. Would like to see some special use cases that are not possible with ETH 
Did you bother to actually dive into their website? They explain in detail how their architecture in layers work, with a settlement layer (SL) for the unit of account and a control layer (CL) for the smart contracts platform. 
If you want even more details, they are insanely active on Github with a very high number of quality repositories.
Seriously what is it
SCALABILITY
Distributed systems are composed of a set of computers (nodes) agreeing to run a protocol or suite of protocols to accomplish a common goal. This goal could be sharing a file as defined by the BitTorrent protocol or folding a protein using Folding@Home.

The most effective protocols gain resources as nodes join the network. A file hosted by BitTorrent, for example, can be downloaded much faster on average if many peers are concurrently downloading it. The speed increases because the peers provide resources while also consuming them. This characteristic is what one typically means when stating a distributed system scales.

The challenge with the design of all current cryptocurrencies is that they actually are not designed to be scalable. Blockchains, for example, are usually an append-only linked list of blocks. The security and availability of a blockchain protocol relies upon many nodes possessing a full copy of the blockchain data. Thus, a single byte of data must be replicated among N nodes. Additional nodes do not provide additional resources.

This result is the same for transaction processing and the gossiping of messages throughout the system. Adding more nodes to the consensus system does not provide additional transaction processing power. It just means more resources have to be spent to do the same job. More network relaying meaning more nodes have to pass the same messages to keep the whole network in synchronization with the most current block.

Given this topology, cryptocurrencies cannot scale to a global network on par with legacy financial systems. In contrast, legacy infrastructure is scalable and has orders of magnitude for more processing and storage power. Adding a specific point, Bitcoin is a very small network relative to its payment peers, yet struggles to manage its current load.

Our scalability goals for Cardano are greatly aided by our consensus algorithm. Ouroboros permits a decentralized way to elect a quorum of consensus nodes, which in turn can run more traditional protocols developed over the last 20 years to accommodate the needs of large infrastructure providers such as Google and Facebook10.

For example, the election of a quorum for an epoch means we have a trusted set of nodes to maintain the ledger for a specific time period. It is trivial to elect multiple quorums concurrently and partition transactions to different quorums.

Similar techniques could be applied for network propagation and also sharding the blockchain itself into unique partitions. In our current roadmap, scaling methods will be applied to Ouroboros starting in 2018 and continue to be a focus in 2019 and 2020.

Not really, just something I remember the founder talking about. And the fact that it’s the single biggest technical challenge for any of these protocols.

This was an excellent suggestion, thanks. I don't know why I didn't think to go through the Cardano subreddit but I didn't.

If anyone is curious, [here is the best technical discussion I found on there](https://np.reddit.com/r/CardanoCoin/comments/7ograi/help_convince_me_to_buy_ada_bounty_offered_for/).
I do. I've sent XRP to family members and they arrived in 3 seconds, and I regularly do. My bank is about to use XRP as well and they've been testing it for months.
I could say that for all my coins. They only time there are network issues Id when people trade on extremely high volume days trying to chase bull runs or run away from crashes. 
When ripple has a huge change these subs are littered with ‘where are my coins!’ And ‘can’t see trx nothing in wallet!’

NYC mayoral candidate, Andrew Yang, just tweeted about BTC and crypto in general	1859.0	https://i.redd.it/ss331p0gdxg61.jpg	"[deleted]
He's apparently leading the race too
Bitcoin is cool but blah blah blah politician talk, hope Bitcoin doesn’t because the next “talking point”
BTC and UBI? Nice combo.
Vote for the man New Yorkers.
Yang Gang!
At first I thought he was taking about BTS (the Korean boy band)
USA is losing the race. ""Financial Capital"" has done left the building
I can feel the regulations from here....
Yah so he can tax it like crazy
[deleted]
Crypto is going bullish and you love to see it!
He has my vote! That would be a major win for crypto in NYC. We currently have very strict crypto laws here.
Andrew Yang for president!
Politicians politicking. Nothing new.
This man will be president one day
Sounds more like populism. What is he going to start with?
Andrew Yang is definitely a mood and I'm here for it.
one of Us.
He doesn't have the Elon clout.
This guy is a loser. Never voting for him!
The world’s financial capital?
Well now he should help with the regulations.
""Decentralized currency""
Bitcoins dominance is declining. The flippening going to happen?
Sounds promising. But I hope that he will pay attention not only to btc, but also to other assets. And I want to be able to pay for purchases using my crypto Ownr card in NY.
Does he have a chance at winning the nomination?
I wish.. nyc loves to elect old cronies.. nyc is fucking trash if you really think about it
Fuck this may make me turn from Sliwa. Although isn’t the point of crypto decentralization?
Well this may make me turn from Sliwa, although isn’t the point of crypto decentralization? But also I suppose adoption could be sped up in the city.
I fucking love Yang. Hope he runs for president again.
Wait so I should research bitlicense to see why I can’t trade in ny?
BitLicense is poison.

""a hub for cryptocurrencies"" is a complete and utter antinomy
If you're looking for reasons to say that, then maybe. A ""hub"" in this context simply means that cryptocurrency use is encouraged. For example, businesses may receive a 5% tax credit if they allow customers to purchase using crypto. There is no ""hub"" in the sense of centralization of crypto. Humans are not a crypto hub, servers are.
If you follow him he’s not the average politician- he in fact stated how dehumanizing it is 

His agendas good
[deleted]
Don’t be a wang vote for Yang
You’re a loser.
k
Yes. New York, London, Hong Kong. Usually in that order.
Flippening to.....whats your call?
[deleted]
But makes BTC more valuable. It's a win-win for crypto holders.
That's some high level paranoid thinking. 

New York is also a tourist hub, do they complete autonomy over tourism? Or do they just provide a tourist market investors can put their money in? I'm going to give you the benefit that the word you meant was autonomy not ""utter antimony"" and that's jumping right over the ""how"" anyone would ever get autonomy over crypto currencies.
Are you ASSuming this or did Yang come out and say it somewhere ?
That doesnt matter
Thank you. Makes me question the money I’ve spent on the WSJ and The Economist subscriptions given my clear inability to retain information. lol
A diversity of altcoins
Hmmm but why are half of the cryptocurrencies in coinbase restricted in ny ; I thought it used to be one of the most lenient states before the first adoption
Uhh... no. I have read the bitcoin and ethereum whitepapers though, and know the basics of how blockchain works as  well as the crypto(graphy) portion of crypto. 

Do you even know what you're talking about? It doesn't matter what you think, or what Yang thinks, a ""hub"" in crypto is a mass of servers or ASIC miners, etc.
For real? I didn't know that...So can you technically head to NJ... Make your purchase and hold it in your wallet while you live in NY? Im confused lol
Where are you pulling that example of that yang can offer something like a  5% tax credit for crypto use or that ever would have a remote chance of happening ?
I have accounts from other states that allow me to trade here but Binance checks your location. Coinbase let’s me trade you just can’t open a new account  with ny Id. 

Just use a vpn and say you’re in the Netherlands. 

Also fuck this nanny state. They’re afraid.
You can buy and hold whatever you want in NY, it's the exchanges that have to pay to do business in state. So kraken for example just doesn't let you sign up at all with a NY address. If you find a private seller to get your crypto you're good to go.
What do you mean “where am I pulling that example from”. 

There are plenty of historical examples of tax credits to businesss for doing something. And Cryptocurrency is new, there are no examples."

$MAC Army Gather Here - This is where we ignite the rally!	169.0	https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreet/comments/l6gvcf/mac_army_gather_here_this_is_where_we_ignite_the/	"I see you took some of my previous comments to put in your post there, Tree. I'm cool with that.

I've been in MAC for months, and I buy more with each small dip. Not only is the stock undervalued compared to the company worth, but it has higher short interest (days-to-cover) than all those other stocks gaining attention for short squeeze effects.

People who are upset they missed last week of GME need to focus on MAC.

I think this could push past $100. I think its fair value is definitely higher than today's price, and I think its reward/risk ratio is perhaps the biggest of any stock on the market today. 

If we can buy it up to $30-40 per share, I suspect the domino effect of the short-squeeze could push it way past $100. I don't think this is a zero-sum game for new buyers. I think, done right, we can all benefit.
me, too. long 10K
Bought 350 shares @ 22

Long MAC with significant position.
Just bought  500 worth at 19 dollars. Let's go
[deleted]
Nice sell order tip 🚀🚀🚀🚀 retardsssss unite
I initiated my position today, along with SKT.  Their respective short levels are at 88% and 78% of their total float.  Not as bad as Gamestop, but still insanely high, and ripe for another GME-like short squeeze.
There is much at stake for the big institutions whose practices try to screw the little guy (the little investor and the little company). They will use propaganda on news channels and other tactics to try to shut the rush down.

For instance, this evening, there was a major sell-off afterhours on everything. This was almost certainly the big institutions trying to scare others into abandoning the game. They are also trying to position themselves with more cash for tomorrow and Friday so that their shorts are not called-in.

We, the little people, must buy the dips and hold. Friday's witching hour will get interesting!

Long MAC!!!
Red Leader, Standing By.
balls deep in this thing, already up 100%
The point that got me horny is class b and c malls are closing leaving even more demand for the best classAs... MAC has some of the best masks in the best areas... Simon properties tried to buy them in 2015 at 95.50 and got rejected.
This is one that can be squeezed really hard and nasty. We need some of the GME boys to see this one!

i've been following for a long time. pissed i didnt buy at $7 but bought some this morning and will buy more tomorrow. i like the stock regardless of  short squeeze but the sort ratio is a cherry on top
Bought in at 22! Letsgoooooo
ALL IN
Have been holding for few months and not selling. Shorts haven't started to cover yet if you look at the short Interest rate
I’m in for 250 shares. Even on fundamentals, it was an interesting diversification play (at least for me with mostly tech) predicated on COVID recovery and the bet that prime real estate is a win combined with the human need for socialization. A fairly decent dividend helps. Then you add in potential upside of any catalyst could lead to a tsunami of shorts covering... this is a big one that could be GME like.
MAC army rise up!  🚀
I am holding $MAC strong waiting on the huge short squeeze to the moon
2000 share to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀next one, a Solid one.
Hold the line , brother and sisters, spread the words out.

Another biggest short float company, Macerich Company (MAC)
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreet/comments/l5ea1b/another_biggest_short_float_company_macerich/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
This is a solid company has real assets and pays dividends. Keep buying and hold let the short squeeze badly.
As someone that bought MAC shares at the beginning of last year, and then watched them tank, this is exciting.
i will buy in tomorrow.  50 shares.
Inside, go MAC
Long since June 2020 and 2.5X my position since January to 2800 shares. Company’s fundamental makes the share price worth at least 35-50$ for now and more on the long term. There are no risk plus dividend comeback and improving malls traffic due to covid vaccine can push the price up a lot even without a shortsqueeze.
$60 takeout price!

https://news.futunn.com/hk/stock/10951028?level=1
Deep in this one, buying more every dip. This thing has huge potential!
Great analysis! New user here, holding Mac since late last year.
Big today today for MAC.  88% of float short.  The naked shorts will be forced to cover soon, and it will spike the price.
Mac is in a dip right now! Good time to buy! Let’s start the squeeze! Hold on don’t sell. Buy as much as you can. Make those shorts lose the bet!
MAC is a strong business with a bright future.  Lots of money to be made at these levels for short term and long term investors.
Bought MAC randomly back at around 10$, only seen it go further and further. It's a weirdly good stock, with much more potential than just a short squeeze. Let's get this MAC to the fucking moon  🚀🍔  🚀 🍔 🚀 🍔 🚀 🍔 🚀
TO THE F\*\*\*ING MOON!!!!
 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
hopefully we get a pleasant surprise tomorrow morning with the dividend announcement!
MAC 🚀🌙 lets run it up
Sonnieboy1950- This is a real stock that pays dividends (albeit fragile).  The company  rejected a bid to buy the entire company some four years ago at around $92.00 per share. It now trades for less than 30% of that.  Granted the pandemic has dented the value of malls, but apparently  they have only the premium, strong properties.  If this company can survive a coming liquidity crunch and the vaccines sufficiently reverse the Covid 19 trend,  then this is a good stock based on fundamental value.  Busting the shorts is merely a sideshow compared to  the likely intrinsic value of the shares and underlying properties.  That’s the way you should look at it.
Everyone buy shares this morning! IT doesn't matter how many just buy some! Early momentum will set this thing on fire.
Agree, very good risk /reward bet with a nice book value and dividend to support current prices. And hope we hit the moon soon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
wsb cannot buy gme or amc, we need to spread the wors and have them go into $MAC
I bought more!
MAC Feb 19 $25 calls, look cheap?
I'm on board!   MAC daddy to the moon when the shorts start covering and running for the exits
This is a very good chance in fact for several reasons currently:

1. MAC has not gotten much attention from the community yet and as a result is not banned from trading anywhere.
2. MAC is in fact GME's landlords for a lot of their stores so there is a direct relationship
3. MAC has much better fundamentals compared to the other short interest plays.
4. MAC is still considerably cheaper and has much more upside.
ontario teachers probably bought into macerich at much higher levels. lets school these teachers and show them how its done 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Was buying under 7$ last year and not going to sell. Lets make a history also here, i'm adding more occasionally
Just added 5k shares
Bought more!
MAC soldier here ... In at $25 though so I'm at the higher end.
buy the dips and hold on
In on MAC!!!!!!
Guys, MAC is at 18.8, come on !  
Look on your phone pad, 
MAC == 622 !
Im holding and buying as i go MAC
Over 400 contracts for the Feb 19 $25 calls have traded FOR $1 in the last hour, GET IN NOW!
Beginning to wonder if Mac is the play continually bought it on the way down not seeing any upside in the short term. 
Anyone got any thoughts on that
currently own 10k shares with a strategy to buy 5k more up or down from these levels and trying to decide which far out of the money calls are the best to purchase for ""group"" gamma squeeze.    any advice from options expert on this board?  thank you in advance!
Just now added to my position again.  Ripe for a short squeeze at 80+% of float.  Class A mall destinations are going no where.  Each metro area will be keeping their best malls, as the lower quality malls close down.   Consolidation means more earnings for MAC.

&#x200B;

Don't forget this is a severely undervalued stock that has good fundamentals.
Saying Macarmybets is unviewable
LEGIT DD FOR MACERICH (MAC)

https://youtu.be/54d4AcdADSo
There was an article yesterday about a large firm selling a massive chunk of MAC, and I've read of many day traders and investors who have been shorting the heck out of MAC this week, driving its price artificially lower.

For instance, if you look at shortvolume.com you can see that MAC had a high percentage of shorts today, which further depresses its price. That's actually the reason the stock price was so low this summer (a gift for those who caught it early). 

Frankly, this battle can't be won without a mass of individuals, and GME, AMC are clearly still the heavy favorites on forums. I could see MAC pushing into a small peak a couple times the next week, but I think the battle for an epic short squeeze is over. I do think the company is going to have a bright future, so I am not planning to unload all my shares. But I probably will rebalance toward my other value stocks (ATRO, WFC, BHLB, MTH), all of which have dipped nicely this week.

I don't know what's best, but I wish everyone luck!
With the recent major dip from that forced selling of MAC by the Ontario Teacher Union, this week is the best time to load up. You probably won’t see these prices again. I’ll be adding more on Monday and holding purely for the dividends and long term future and to Screw over these hedge fund assholes of course
Is any one buying call options on MAC? March 19? June 18? Strike price?
>Key-Tie2542

Yes, my apologies for not giving credit where it is due (will edit).  Just trying to get out as much helpful info as possible and condense it to one place.  Can't wait to watch this rip higher!  100% agree that $100 is easily feasible if not much, much higher.
The reopening trade has started! Combine that with the huge short interest and MAC is ripe. I think REITS are going to catch a serious institutional bid soon as they start to rotate to value and normal economy after rona.
Keep in mind that $spg wanted to pay $95.50 for MAC in 2015 and MAC management told them to F off because it was too low... Metrics have gotten better since. This is short term a $50 stock and maybe a lot higher on a squeeze.
Where is r/Wallstreetbets moving to? I need to talk to my brothers.

5 min listen: the IRS is underfunded, middle class pay their taxes, wealthy are getting away with fraud	107.0	https://www.npr.org/2022/01/26/1075717058/its-likely-to-be-a-frustrating-tax-season-deputy-treasury-secretary-says	"He said, 'the wealthy are getting away with tax fraud' out loud in his professional capacity. Now to address how collected tax money is being re-distributed.
So what the democrats do is come after the middle class even more, look at how things went all 2021. Nothing but hidden pork in every bill to screw the middle class. This is ridiculous, Now they are trying to pass a bill where yellen can ban any crypto, scummy fucking democrats
I thought the Biden infrastructure bill included funding to beef up IRS enforcement?
Radical idea….maybe the government could spend more wisely. Naw, raise them taxes up up up. Tried and true formula. /s
The US has always favored the RICH, always will.  Nothing will ever change.  It's all a fucking joke
Recent studies show the poor are audited at twice the rate of the wealthy. Easy prey.
Taxation is theft... whether by inflation or theft of your wages or earnings...
*surprised pikachu face*
Did you all forget $600?  Seriously the wealthy can hire and use every tax rule to their advantage legally.  The IRS is overfunded in my book and waste way way to much effort on people or families making  80k a year or less.
The absolute unfairness of the social distribution system
This is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever read. How can you be underfunded when you have the highest funding on earth & run a 1:1 deficit..? You pull money out thin air, all the wealthy people in America cannot make up for that. What they can do is contribute to expand the economy which in turn adds more to it, their massive net worths are tied up in the businesses that keep the country afloat at this point.
Flat tax no loopholes or write offs, all income, all assets: 5 to 10% for low to mid bracket, 20% high income bracket, 25% to the 1%.  Obviously the real percentages wouldn't be this high after real analysis but tax laws shouldn't be complex, you only create the opportunity for fraud then. Refunds are only issued because it was our money in the first place.
The IRS underfunded OMFG…. The entire government is far overfunded. We should move to either a flat rate for all or tax consumption.
Well, look at the medical industry. All taxpayer money that goes into it actually accelerates the disparity. Same thing goes for infrastructure, military, assisted housing; literally all of it will disproportionately funnel more wealth into the hands of the few.
You’re just now learning that Democrats give crumbs to the peasants to keep the elite in power?
This is how socialism works. Funds are needed to cover all the promises made of cradle to grave care.  So taxes are raised and aggressively collected. 

The wealthy have the means to fight or otherwise avoid paying. The poor don’t have the money, or assets, to tax. That leaves the middle class. 

Over the course of only a couple of short decades, the middle class is no more.  What’s left is a society compromised of a few very rich, and many, many poor. 

It has been happening in Latin America for years. And if we allow, it will happen here in the USA as well.
Would you care to point to a couple of the worst examples you can think of? Like the largest sums of money given that you consider pork hurting the middle class.
Yes and the red fascist stopped the gold pattern, causing with nixon all the inflation problems we are seing today.
It absolutely is theft. It was created to rebuild after a war, but then has continued. It will never stop. It is too easy for govt to take it
I'll be lucky to make half that this year
I totally agree with these rates I just say end the loopholes and that would be enough thanks
That's both parties.
You have a very poor understanding of socialism.
The gold standard ended in the 1930's due to volatility and exploitation.  What Nixon did was end the gold exchange.  The dollar wasn't pegged to gold back then.  What was going on is that the dollar became the worlds reserve currency (well the post WWII allies world).  When this happened the US agreed to a standardized rate of exchange for gold.  Due to inflation (mostly due to Vietnam) France decided to cash out, which drained the gold reserve at a really unfavorable rate.  Nixon ended that.  In reality the dollar had nothing to do with gold values outside of a arbitrary exchange rate only applicable to the dollar being used as a reserve currency by nation states.
It would stop, or at least reformed, if the middle class united with the working class in order to organize tax strikes and direct action.
For one person that is 40k but you get the idea.
Causing usa to start printing money without any thought on what might happend. Causing all the inflation that we see today
🍻
They were doing that before.  That's what caused the crisis, because France was exchanging the their dollar reserve for gold at something like $35/once rate when gold was $60+ dollars per once.  Again.  The value of the dollar had nothing to do with the value of gold since the 30's when the gold standard ended.  

Inflation also isn't just about printing money.  It has more to do with where demand meets supply.  That's why we didn't see huge inflation with the 2008 recovery.  Trillions were printed, but the dept crises kept demand in check while stimulus was primarily geared towards inflationary spending to prevent deflation with the lower demand. Today, is a whole different beast.  Less dept, less daily expenses, work from home, blanket stimulus, supply chain issues and the covid response has pushed demand far beyond supply, which causes inflation."						
Can a small business build an internal investment fund?	9.0	https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/kq94zf/can_a_small_business_build_an_internal_investment/	"Also wondering if you can start an internal fund from an LLC
i know that public companies (public stocks) invest in ""marketable securities"" which are short term money market funds. perhaps you can buy stocks too?
Did you ever do anything with this?  Of course this can be done, but there are a number of reasons why doing this in the same entity don't make sense unless it's a very small amount.   
 Unless your aunt wants to withdraw from the main business and is looking for something else to do, this will just be a distraction and could be very detrimental to their main business.  I would be concerned that some bad investments or decisions could sour family relations unless your son really knows what he is doing.

Just get with an emerging fund that has some track record.  Small funds tend to get better returns than larger funds anyway and will usually take smaller subscriptions.  If you go this route, make sure the Fund Manager has a sizable chunk of his own money in the funds as well.  This keeps them focused and interests aligned!  Depending how much you have to invest, that could be a better way to go.  I am launching a hedge fund now.  We will be open to outside money in a couple months.  We had triple digit returns for 2020 (waiting for the audit to be completed soon) and on track for close to the same in 2021."

Am I sposed to buy Bitcoin with Bitcoin? All I've got left is Bitcoin.
He bought? Dump it.
I bought so many dips my dips got dips
Just got my $16 nicehash payout, ya'll probably saw it on the whale reports.
You guys have ever had money?
I think definition of dip is when it goes up again after it goes down.. when we have dips after dips after dips, it's no longer a dip, i guess we are just going DOWN
Please stay down until payday.
No, but i get paid bi-weekly so i'll be back soon lol
I had a feeling the dip was going to be very dippy. I sold off most my tokens back to fiat then bought everything back at a way cheaper rate and got more for less. That’s how you buy when you have no money left to buy.
Lol
I feel that
Seriously. The dip and then the dip to the dip and then the dippity dip followed by the dippity doo dip

Crash me outside, how bout dat?
Yah, i added BMI, FWT and VET this week. Trying to figure out the market...
I just to DCA on some coins, I don't go all in haha especially right now. Recently bought ETH MATIC and PINK. You gotta join the Staking program of Dot Finance while still early. Coz they do provide massive APY.
Some people have short term memory problems. The crash comes down hard, creates a new low, then skyrockets. Been in this game for 5+ years and now is the time to buy. Buy projects that have potential for massive gains. Mine are REN, DOT, ADA.
There will never be another ""dip"" for me in Doge. I bought mine at $0.00028

This is so amusing. You stake your life to whatever you love. Sell everything to gain everything. I just staked with YLA Powerpool ,am expecting 15% + APY. It is the first decentralized index providing exposure to Bsc based asset. It's worth looking at.
I would definitely go for NIF. They provide high returns to the users.

Mark my word, soon it will cross 200x-300x mark in couple of months. NIF is the native token of UNIFTY, one of the top NFT projects.

It is one of the est project under $50m market cap.
You people are still holding ??    


PS: I am still holding
Too real.
I feel this so much
This assumes make money outside of crypto, but sadly I do not
Ya some people have a job and get a paycheck its how we keep stacking sats! Look into it!
When the dip never ends...
Just a little bit at a time!
Farm your stuff for more and then keep buying dips. Seleniumswap will allow to farm from 29 June 21:43 UTC , The presale is live [here](https://seleniumswap.com/presale). This is the only project with an active program against rugpull. Do your research [here](https://selenium-1.gitbook.io/seleniumswap/)
Tend to resort to DCA, especially in times like this. This is the time in the market in which a lot of buyers buy the dip.
Lmao 🤣 Ian Gallagher memes are so funny

I just bought the Amp dip. Then it dipped again hahahahaha fml 🤦🏾‍♂️.. that was absolutely my last. Time to ride it out
No Ragrets!
Liquidate stocks that are all time high now - I did liquidate AMC when it got high and was able to dump more into crypto.
Lol! I feel it so much,the last fund available I bought RELI dips, and now what? I wish to buy more..
Like how?
yup - I just sold off my friend house, hahahahahahah

FWT is still a good buy. I guess we will see some movement once they give us the access to their platform on July 14th. Finally, there won't be a waitlist anymore and all 100k+ people will be able to use it.
How much APY when we stake PINK? 🤑

Hilarious. You know Ripple is an international company right? They could be outright banned from the US and XRP would still exist and be worth money. Most of their biggest operations and XRP in use are overseas right now. Idiot.
Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment.

I hold a bunch of Dogecoin and ain't selling, I have some cash on the side to jump into an interesting new project like Wallfair or to buy the dip like MATIC...
THC positive
I'd rather buy some low cap coins having solid FA. While waiting for the market to recover, I'm staking my LINK, DOT, and USDT on Dot Finance's DeFi Yield aggregator.
Crash ate me
I am the trash. Who wants to buy me so I can buy the dip?
I feel happy when I see comments like this.  It shows me how far we still have to grow.  

Most markets would just leverage margin, but not this one yet.  Goes to show there’s still much work to be done.  Exciting!
Who cares at this point-it would all go back to the same entity
You could via Baanx with Bitcoin and with an interest-free option alongside it.
.0005 min to coinbase
What pool did you choose? PLUG, ETH or USDC?
Yeah I feel ya man. My strategy is to keep an eye on the top 10 cryptos I want and compare the last dips and see how low it went. Chances are it’ll go lower on a death cross and it did but I was definitely taking a stab at the goal number and luckily it worked out but easily could have gone either way. This was the first big dip I’ve gone through so I had some plans and back up plans and back up plans for the back up plan. Ultimate goal is to come out on top though of course lol.
Ya man most people miss the bottoms of the dips. You really have to be looking at it all the time I feel.
So does Cardano but whatever floats your boat.
Yeah! Have you seen their Supercharger products? I wanna try DOT and GOLD staking.
Right now, I have no idea because its not actually the same but the last time I checked it was 80-90% APY for LINK and USDT
Thanks
Lol. You’re fine bot. For now. Don’t blow it.
Was not expecting a hug from that link but thanks haha
Dude, whats MATICs use case after eth 2? That doesn’t feel like a good long term play
yeh but 500,000 $SAFEMOON for 1 kidney is pretty good.
Dip ate me
PLUG one. i think it's going to be enough. what did you choose? i know that the other two gonna have bigger APY
That is a good strategy to have. My eyes glaze over when ever I am looking at technical stuff and I really need to know more. 

Hopefully we all will come out on top!
I wish I had better alerts or something.
I am more interested in USD and EUR because the APY is 43%. You will never see that again. And I am sure that you can't name any other platform that does the same.
We never know and maybe ETH 2.0 wouldn't be as good as MATIC too ,. Anyway right now I focus on micro-cap or new projects like Wallfair during this bear market it's the best thing to do I think.
when will eth 2 be? I need to know to sell of my mining profits
got no time for this shit dude... P&D bullshit. Check PINK mate, listing on MEXC Global soon. DYOR
Eat the dip!!
Ya my best advice is to always have some cash ready on the side lines to buy. I find at peak dips it can be slow to transfer funds fro
 Fiat to crypto so it’s good to have some In there for the dips. Also good to zoom out and see the trends and have an idea of what’s a really good price and what’s just inflated at the moment. This will help you figure out what to buy on the dips perhaps. Also remember we are all in this crypto game early and there is lots of time for gains still. Just be patient and use your Will power to help stay patient.
I know eh. I set notifications for specific coins to be at specific prices and I always get them the day after. Like wtf is that!
Haha brother I was joking, I wouldnt touch SAFE with a ten foot pole.

Ill have3 a look into PINK.

nice nice! that's a very wise decision bruh. We need to invest in something real this time. Considering the fundamental analysis.   
   
PINK is already listed on MEXC global bro. +100% up gains
But too much dip on my chip.
I used Tether once and then I heard about the possible shit show that it is so I realized I could just “sell” the token back to my fiat account  on the app for a small fee that I consider the cost of doing business, and buy it back with that fiat.

				Chris Cuomo destroys Robinhood's Vlad Tenev on his market manipulation	100.0	https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/l7t7ta/chris_cuomo_destroys_robinhoods_vlad_tenev_on_his/	"Nice work Cuomo! Put the screws to Rob-n-steal and he had no answers.
Oofff. This looks horrible for Robinsteal.
Cuomo and the legislators in this specific instance have no idea of which side of their ass they are speaking.  All the Robinfools who selected them for their low fees and requirements are now paying the piper for choosing the self clearing B/D.  They had a capital call on their order flow equity line, as well as a reference from the SEC on accounts with suspicious profiles/activities.

They approached their max line, and couldn't expand quickly enough to facilitate any margin calls or flow payments.

DTCC issued them a capital call overnight, and hence their raising of funds from investors, and the subsequent release of trading restrictions on certain securities.
>Not Cuomo.

Yes Cuomo... he's doing the same exact thing.  He didn't address what Vlad said, just brought up something else every time.  Sounds like every other person making wild claims, just more confident.

>mythical ""regulatory requirements"" he was trying to fulfill.

These requirements aren't ""mythical"" they are just aren't something you can explain in a 5 min news spot.  You want him to stop and walk through how a clearing house works?  He literally just said, they need to comply with regulations.  He cannot possibly list out every regulation that came into play here.  That's not even his job, its the clearing house.  They know the regulations better than anyone here.  If they call up saying they need to do X or Y, they need to do X or Y.  If you guys feel this regulation is ""mythical"" then call up DTC and tell them you're going to sue them or something.

This whole situation is going to separate those who know how trading works on a fundamental level and those who don't.

Just wait, in a few days everyone will say they ""always knew about the DTC"" 

All I see are people completely outside their domain making incredible claims they have no way of backing up.  The hysteria has gotten out of control.

Here's more if you actually want to know.

I've been a Robinhood user for a while and with the recent news that has just come out about the CEO, I'm looking to move away from them. Does anyone have suggestions on a better trading app to use? Thanks in advance for any help or advice.
Had some more time to go through this:

*1:25*

Cuomo: Why did you do it, if it wasn't to help hedge funds?

Vlad: The idea that it was done for market makers is a rumor and false.

*direct quote*

>Robinhood, as a brokerage has lots of financial requirements, SEC requirements, **we have to put up money at clearing houses, the amount of money we have to put up depends on market volatility**, we're in historic situations where there's a lot of activity and a lot of buying, concentrated in a relatively small number of symbols that are going viral on social media.

The rest is kinda PR talk, sure, be pissed at that, can't blame you.  Its basically saying though that ""we ran out of money"" - because *as traders* we all know how trading works, right?  The involvement of clearing houses, margin accounts and DTC? ... right?

If I would have expected anyone to understand its the trading subs.  I'm no corporate shill and you can see me shitting on big tech in previous comments.  However, I really just can't sit by while such blatant misinformation floats around in my field.

*2:50*

Cuomo basically ignores everything Vlad said and zeros in as soon as he mentions RHs customers, because that's literally all he's there to do.  He doesn't want the answer, he wants to get sound bytes grilling the CEO.

*3:00*

Cuomo: Just one thing without getting in the weeds here

lol alright, so yea, literally telling Vlad ""don't get too detailed"" - he doesn't want answers.

Then he goes on his planned point of ""NYSE shuts stocks down, not you"" even though Vlad explained already that they did it because of other regulations and basically not having the collateral.

*3:50* 

Cuomo: Why did you do this?

Vlad: We have to comply with financial requirements-

Cuomo: cuts him off, says SEC didn't say they had to shut down trading.

Vlad: Explains that RH and literally every broker had to do this because of regulation (should keep a counter of how many times it has to be said at this point).

*4:45*

Cuomo: Cuts Vlad off *again*, asks yet another question, ""why are people allowed to sell but not buy, that sounds like it only helps hedge funds""

Vlad: Explains yet again that it has nothing to do with market makers or any other connections, rather depository requirements.

When you actually watch, Cuomo does nothing but get sound bytes.  He doesn't actually address anything Vlad said.  You can tell so easily he just had a script and was going to say it no matter what Vlad said because everything Cuomo says is independent of Vlad's responses.

If people are serious about knowing what is actually happening, they can read stuff like:

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25951475

https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/l74njo/any_thoughts_on_why_alpaca_is_also_jumping_on_the/gl4u8nv/

Really can't believe even the trading subs seem to want to flaunt their ignorance of the issue.  The closer you get to discussing with people actually in the industry, the more nuance, reason and detail you come across.  Not some news anchor grilling a CEO for views.  I'm sorry but this is akin to watching congress grill Zuckerburg asking how Facebook works when half the people upvoting don't even know what the DTC is or why this is happening.

Look, I don't blame people for the initial distrust, confusion and anger... however continuing to push conspiracies and misinformation (like Citadel owns RH???) based off vague tweets and ""I work at RH and got a call from the president"" is just not a good look, especially for a trading sub.

vlad is almost certainly telling the truth though... probably the dtcc requirements, right?
exactly.

This is going to separate those who actually know how trading works (or at least willing to learn) and those who don't.

I cannot even imagine now how many times I've seen shit on the news not in my field and have to question if they fuck up as much as they do with finance.
First of all, thank you for taking the time to respond and sharing some details, I do want to learn.

I admit I was wrong to call the requirements ""mythical"". Still, and perhaps I'm missing some other detail, restricting one side of their clients' specific trades appears, at best, like very a crude and naive solution to brokers' money problems. 

Why would they not instead slow down the entire operation while they're looking for extra capital? Like rate-limit all trades on all securities on both sides? They don't guarantee executing any trades so I can't imagine that would cause as much ire from the public and as much losses to their customers as what they did implement. 

They manipulated the market, whether that was the original intent or not. Given that they used the most literal solution to their capital problem and that that solution benefited very well-known parties... It's just hard not to maintain suspicion.
It seemed like RH CEO didn’t wanna say specifically the problem (cash shortage for collateral for the clearing house) because he didn’t wanna harm his business going forward by making people think RH won’t be able to tolerate such volumes in the future, which will scare people away to other bigger and better Capitalized brokers. But seems like whatever he is choosing to say is affecting RH negatively today and will affect it in the future.
I asked proptrader a question at the bottom of your first link, you are most welcome to answer it, if interested. Be ez
Anything is better than Robinhood and that was true before the recent news.  Hard to recommend any one in particular as they all have pros/cons.  Depends on what/how you are trading.
>Does anyone have suggestions on a better trading app to use?

They literally all shut down trading on GME because they all had the same issue.  This isn't an issue exclusive to RH.
Maybe TradeZero?
Very fair points on the fact that the problem was real for them, I understand it was wrong to put the onus on that now. But the solution they and other brokers chose to implement just strikes me as unconscionable in the absence of other, undisclosed factors. 

Implementing software restrictions on a specific side of a specific, hypervolatile trade... Did they not understand it would blow up? If they did, was there another motivation to pick that specific approach? If there isn't an alternative, just slow down the entire operation, all markets, all sides, at least you won't be accused of manipulating prices.
Depends on the approach. If it's outrage news you can basically guarantee it's wrong.
>First of all, thank you for taking the time to respond and sharing some details, I do want to learn.

Sorry to say I was probably a bit harsh.  It's just insane the amount of misinformation I've seen and its like nobody feels like checking it.

>I admit I was wrong to call the requirements ""mythical"". Still, and perhaps I'm missing some other detail, restricting one side of their clients' specific trades appears, at best, like very a crude and naive solution to brokers' money problems.

I would completely agree with you if RH allowed for short selling.  Closing an order isn't the same as opening.  Just to be *very* simple, RH is like a casino with chips, you have a stack of money and they will let you just play with the chips as long as they see your stack of money.  Its never your money being used, always the chips.  This is a layer of abstraction most people don't realize, for lack of a better word, all your trading is ""simulated"" but to get back to it...  Lets pretend GME is the only ""table"" available.  Its fine to take your chip off the table, but if RH is out of chips, they're out of chips.  ""selling"" in this sense is just taking your chip back.  RH basically got a call from *their* chip provider saying ""this table is too volatile and crazy, you need to back up any chips on this table with more cash"" and RH simply didn't have the cash.  All the fancy PR talk just comes down to ""we didn't have the money to support the customers"" - as bad as it sounds, I prob would have made the same call because this thing they pulled will prob be better for them than saying ""yea we're out of money"" which could have been *really* bad... as demonstrated, people wouldn't get the nuance that they're not out of money entirely, just they need more to back up trading on certain symbols.

That's prob not the best explanation, as I'm just bad at thinking of analogies off the top of my head.. but that's the gist of it!

>Why would they not instead slow down the entire operation while they're looking for extra capital? Like rate-limit all trades on all securities on both sides?

Not sure if this is possible for RH to do.

>They manipulated the market, whether that was the original intent or not. Given that they used the most literal solution to their capital problem and that that solution benefited very well-known parties... It's just hard not to maintain suspicion.

I just can't see it that way considering this is the only logical outcome of the situation.  I would argue, maybe as customers one should *know* how much collateral RH has on hand for any given stock so one would ""know"" when the DTC might make a call... but I would wager that would have been ignored by everyone anyways.

And even then, I hate to say it but who is ""they"" ? Every single broker on wallstreet?  RH wasn't the only broker that suspended trading.  Even considering the links to Citadel, other brokers aren't involved with them, yet still suspended trading.  What would they have to gain from that?
That is exactly it.

We can all sit here and say ""he should tell the truth"" but I'm guessing 99% of us would do the same exact thing if we were the CEO of RH.

Doing this is *probably* better than alluding to money problems.

Ofc its still wrong to lie or try to obfuscate truth, that should be called out when it happens.  He's just talking in a very PR friendly way... but the truth is there.
I doubt any broker could handle the volume unless they made it so your balance didn't change until 2 days after a trade to reflect the actual reconciliation of the cash involved. So instead, they abstract people's available funds because no one would use the first broker.
From what I hear on here, Fidelity did not. TD restricted options and margin, but you could still buy shares.
>But the solution they and other brokers chose to implement just strikes me as unconscionable in the absence of other, undisclosed factors.

I get what you're saying... its just this is a ""financial crisis"" of sorts.  There was no way for them to ""fix"" this, otherwise they would cause I'm sure as hell they would have loved to say ""look we're the only brokers that didn't shit the bed on GME!"" but the problem was just beyond their control.

>Implementing software restrictions on a specific side of a specific, hypervolatile trade... Did they not understand it would blow up? If they did, was there another motivation to pick that specific approach? If there isn't an alternative, just slow down the entire operation, all markets, all sides, at least you won't be accused of manipulating prices.

I sincerely believe they didn't do it to fuck their customers at the expense of Citadel.  That's just *really* brazen.

They would be in *actual* trouble with the SEC for doing that.  As it stands, I don't think they're even in trouble.  SEC is well aware of the regulations that caused this.  They would probably have been wiped off the earth by the SEC if they didn't let people close, intentionally.
Yeah, it makes sense that Tenev wasn't fully direct on being in a capital crunch, I understand he has to balance transparency with triggering liquidity concerns.

I'm curious, why do you think rate-limiting all trades wouldn't be an option? Honest question from an outsider. I don't think a broker like RH would ever guarantee any trade completion to begin with so what would be a problem with temporarily rising the number of trades that don't complete across the board?
No doubt RH has models describing how much cash it needs to have on hand and how much it can allow to be flowing in and out as trades are made. I understand that when you make a trade it takes two days to settle, but RH and other brokers front you the cash right away. They can do that so long as, in general, a lot of money is generally moving around. 

However, i bet the model breaks if half their users, on about the same day, all try to sell their stocks and then buy another. They simply won't have the cash on hand for 2 days. And there's no way they want to admit or describe that.
But given the hate and battle between Robinhooders toward hedge funds, I feel like it would’ve been better to say they got short on cash, because now it looks like they are doing short sellers a favor. More people would be understanding of cash issues, but everyone wants to burn RH down now because they think they are doing this for the HF. And most people on RH don’t know how trading works, so u got an angry, “technicality” uneducated mob who are leaving robinhood for good. I had some crypto in a RH account, I closed and left because I didn’t wanna take further risk of being unable to add or reduce in the future. Today they restricted dogecoin, which seems now they are targeting anything with high volume. You won’t be able to make money with them in such fast environments.
>I'm curious, why do you think rate-limiting all trades wouldn't be an option?

I'm guessing there's a good reason.  I can give opinion but this stuff is so complicated you would have to talk to someone in the know on regulations (which is like a handful of people cause its so boring lol).

My best guess is that unless its coming from the NYSE, limiting trading is something that would actually get them in trouble.  It would be super unfair to their customers vs other customers.  Say GME dropped (which it could have, easily) and some poor dude had some $100k in there, he could lose $50k just because he couldn't get his orders through due to limitations.  Closing an order is ""fine"" as its getting out of risk.  Essentially forcing your customer to play the lottery to get rid of their risk is 100x worse than just letting them close, imo.

>I don't think a broker like RH would ever guarantee any trade completion to begin with so what would be a problem with temporarily rising the number of trades that don't complete across the board?

ahhh, hmm with this I'd say it was more an issue with DTC saying they needed to match the collateral.  To the best of my knowledge, the DTC prob would reject such a plan.  Easiest and probably only solution for RH was to turn it off, vs jerry-rig a solution.  I don't really know *that* much about DTC and regs, so I won't pretend to.  I just know the ""layout"" of the system to the point where their explanation makes more sense than theories they did it to benefit citadel.

and just wanna say, great to see a respectful discussion on this! hoping someone that knows more than me could maybe answer.  When I say its a *few* people I really mean its very few people that really know all the parts of the machine.  Sadly, I don't think they'll take time out of their busy day to visit reddit and explain to us :/ If anything, I think that's a problem highlighted by this whole mess.
>However, i bet the model breaks if half their users, on about the same day, all try to sell their stocks and then buy another. They simply won't have the cash on hand for 2 days. And there's no way they want to admit or describe that.

I'd say this is true.

It just keeps coming down to the fact that they pretty much just ran out of money.  They could have always asked for more or ""prepared"" more but I think its telling when *all* the brokers had the same issue.

All except those not really being used to trade meme stocks lol
>More people would be understanding of cash issues

I tend to believe this too... but we're talking from the timeline that didn't experience this lol.  Bank runs wouldn't happen if everyone were perfectly rational thinkers.  I could see a lot of people taking their money out of RH thinking it was ""going down"" or something.

They wouldn't understand its just for one stock.

That's just imo tho, we really can't say what would or wouldn't happen ig.

>And most people on RH don’t know how trading works, so u got an angry, “technicality” uneducated mob who are leaving robinhood for good.

Today they restricted dogecoin, which seems now they are targeting anything with high volume. You won’t be able to make money with them in such fast environments.

This is fair.  Just saying its not exclusive to RH and this could and will happen with any broker.  Just hits RH hardest since they're the most popular.
I certainly appreciate a civil discussion on this as well, especially with someone more knowledgeable than me and especially after the perhaps too strongly emotional kick off on my end. I remain skeptical though I certainly have more food for thought. I trust that SEC will do their job in case any of the allegations are true, as you alluded to in another message. Even if none of the allegations are real, it seems there might be some regulatory gaps to fill.
Yeah. I can't even really be mad at them for it. We are seeing all the standard models broken here and lrts will be scambling to adapt.
Yep... I would say its just not feasible to sit on mountains of cash for ""once a decade"" events.

Especially when the hype dies down pretty much the next day."		
My mom’s birthday present to me! She knows I enjoy day trading	2867.0	https://i.redd.it/f8dyunn6b7s61.jpg	"I bought on that last green candle as is tradition.
That last candle giving anxiety to anyone who looks at your shirt 😂
Higher highs higher lows 💪
What is the green for?
Good support area in that last bar - probably buying.
Why did they print it upside down?
Happy bday bro 🔥
What's with the sweet VHS... thing... in the background??
Awwwwww go mom!
coolest mom
How sweet!
Too much green for me.
Got one cool mom
Awwww, your mom’s cute!
What's that green stuff?
Oh fuck I like that. I might have to grab one. Know where she got it?
nice, its great gift, respect
[deleted]
I would love shit like this but my wife literally never buys anything I’m interested in unless I tell her haha can’t say I don’t do the same though.
Lol.  That is a short setup.  #btfd
I've got the same shirt upside down though.

A little bit realistic.
Looks like a penis.
Kinda too basic design but a nice gift
So your mom support your gambling habit?
How is it going up?
Nice M formation here 😂
Your mom is awesome!!!
That is awesome! Hahaha where can I buy this shirt? My brother would love this and so would I
Where did you get this shirt?! :)
I guess it came down to a choice between the t-shirt, a brothel, or a doob. Good choice ma! Happy B Day!!
What are all those things between the red candles, and why is the chart upside down?
Im shorting the up trend because of the bearish engulfing candle
I would long that
Hahaha my girlfriend got me a similar shirt for Christmas. Happy birthday man!
Where can I get this shirt?
All pipes!
It’s my bday too! DMX and Prince Philip went out on this the day of our birth.
I still haven’t got mine yet.
Happy birthday
Amazing!
Needs more red.
Love the loss at the end.
Moms are the best.
That last candle got me worried...
Your Mom rocks 👍
Calls on that chart. Very nice channel.
If you reverse it, it looks like my BB chart
All you need on there is ""To the Moon"" and you straight.
Proud parents always encourage their children to excel. 👏📈
Such a cute gift!
Love it, want one. 

I wish my mom loved me...
Do you also enjoy giant sized home movies with mom?
Imma wear this upside down to better illustrate my portfolio during last Q
Would have been better if she bought a downtrend lmao
wait ... that a downward trend ...
I wanna draw support/resistance lines on your shirt while youre wearin it as a covert way of stimulating your nipples.
Omg I love your bed cover where can i buy it?
Omg I love your bed cover where can I buy it?
Mom knows whats up! Hell yeah
She gave you a 3 wave up.
I bought calls at middle green candle and premiums got killed.
I bought middle green sold halfway red bought back in at peak green then held. If you don't sell you dont lose money

No way, it’s falling off a cliff
That doesn't look like a good long to me, I'd be going short right about there
Because just like when you wanna short a stock you just flip your monitor upside down
It's the right way when you look down at your chest while your wearing it...............the shirt is a symbol of perspective of how they see it vs how you see it while wearing it of course
Thanks !

Haha. If I was going to pick a pattern for a shirt, it would be a deep cup with ONE bottom point and a very even and predictable growing candle size on the up side with 0 pullbacks.
Double top
Yes sir! Bullish pattern was engulfed by bearish candle, confirmation candle being the last candle signaling short momentum, selling until atleast the support from previous low. Lmaoooo
I need one, Googling.
Awesome thanks!
You got people in the thread saying they would long that.
Day trading is extra gamble comparing to other type of investment

Take me to the moon.	2584.0	https://i.redd.it/3n4tymln2bt61.jpg	"I know a dude that dumped a couple stacks into DOGE,to kinda use it as a ""stablecoin""... go fucking figure...the shit explodes over the next week. The mfkr couldn't have been luckier.

That's like the dude at the casino that accidentally presses 100x bet or max bet and hits a line of 7s first try.
Doge is 100% gambling and nothing else. Buy good cryptos.
Just hold..I'm try story here..got sick of my doge..got rid of all my puppies and kept a few ""breeders"" ....then...it doubled..that night....so I waited an added more..Just keep everything is my motto now..🤔😜🧨
Why is a penis poking Elon Musk with a stick?
Freaking Doge I knew I should of put 100 bucks in when back in Nov. I said nay, I can’t tell you how much money I have felt on the table for not listening to my gut. The gut knows people the gut knows.
Doge coin was primed for action.

 1. Easily accessible to uneducated noobs as their only option on a non-crypto stock app.

 2. Pumped by famous person. 

 3. Noobs buy only option they have, and tell other noobs ""it's the next bitcoin"" because their noob brains don't understand shit coins.
This thread aged well
It actually was already a pretty good day for Doge yesterday 😅
😂😹😹😹💀💀💀💀💀💀
if Bitcoin is GOLD
Doge is SILVER
How do you feel now?
5x in a week 
2x in the last 24hrs

Damn, why did I not invest in the meme economy?
There are so many other WAY better coins wtf
NGL Doge got me started in crypto and I’ll be forever grateful.  I realize it’s a shit coin.  I also realize that people in general are idiots and will invest in this.  I’m not dumping my life savings into Doge but I may $50 ride n see where it takes me in ten years
funny how a lot of the people on this sub in particular talk shit about doge because they’re losing out while other people are making money and that makes them mad bagholding underperforming coins. I posted on here months ago asking if $500 in doge around .0032 was a good idea and everyone talked shit on it lolllll
This is a meme coin, TBH I hope it will die soon
Your still at .12 dont worry maaan be happy!!
I just put up some actual cryptos as collateral in order to borrow and short 50,000 doge.
Take me to the river🎶

Don't the rules of this group say no memes? Awesome.  Keep them coming.  Down with the man. Who needs rules? More doge coin memes. I have not laughed so hard in all my life.  The only thing missing now is a Brazilian poverty story, then my morning will finally be complete.
Follow that intuition!
Buy better coins
Hahah
this, but at 1000 lolz

I used to mine doge when it was brand new.  I bought millions of them when they cost 0.000000001 cents.  Lost my wallet like 10 years ago.

Yeah, I was trying to figure out what was so attractive to Doge to have such a pump. But it's indeed gambling I guess.
i told my parents not to use robinhood and not to buy crypto, they have no experience with it and they dont even know what they’re doing, i woke up to a 1000 dollar deposit and a 100 dollar dogecoin buy this morning 😒 i told em not to like 2 days ago, i tried telling them dogecoin isn’t a serious investment since people are doing it for the lols too, i told em that this crytpo relies on elon musk and they dont understand
VeChain all the way
buy ethereum while it’s still below $10k
Imagine being this guy haha so bitter
Held Doge since 2018,sold it when it didnt amount to anything...had to get bags of polkamon and it doing good already just announced a partnership with MATIC which is not a bad idea
Vechain don't need no Muskyboi tweets.

I think the original comment is a joke... So you think other cryptos are more predictable or better for making money? And that there exist ""good cryptos"" and ""bad cryptos""? All cryptos have a reason for their existence and whether they are good or bad is highly subjective. Sure then go ahead spend your investment on ""good cryptos"", good luck. Reddit is full of circle jerking noobs that fall for the basic dogma
What are good cryptos?
Sir this is a casino... Sooky cry baby ass beetch,
DOT any day over memes
I knew that 100 percent this morning got in at 0.13 and exited at 0.18 and was sweating bullets watching it lol

Eh the whole markets growing exponentially its hard to lose money atm as long as you do a little research and you don't have the patience of a toddler. Amd dont buy ath's!
Got some funny answers when I asked for some advice on how to surprise my girlfriend with newfound crypto smarts. 

Someone said tot tell her to buy a ALL the DOGE. Which of course I understood to be a joke... now I’m wondering what if.. 😓
[https://imgur.com/gallery/NJMvEdT](https://imgur.com/gallery/NJMvEdT)
It'll come down to some lower level and chill for a while. Doge is only really good for it's pump and dump cycles. Give it time.
Yeah. Do not ever ever ever ever buy something because you ""think"" its a good idea. No. You trust that weird fucking feeling in your gut before you listen to your stupid fuckin brain.
It’s not the only crypto on RH-is that the app you’re referring to?
100% this, ppl are sheep and don’t want to do their own research. But hey if you capitalized and made guap, then good on you. I just don’t see sustainable growth.
Tell me this, what does bitcoin actually have on doge other than being the founding cryptocurrency? As cryptos go, they are on the same level. There is no underlying business. It is simply an asset in its own right, thats value is determined by confidence in the coin itself and the market in general. 

If anything, DOGE could be an indicator of long term market health.
How yw feeling today dude lol
That's what I thought and that's why I was holding Nano.   
But got tired of people just buying things for no reason so I sold Nano and bought Dogecoin a month ago.   
Good Doge
That's because you got lucky over the richest man in the world shitposting on twitter rather than making an informed choice. 

Crypto is supposed to be a decentralized alternative to banking, not a rich people's plaything. You got hate because you're feeding into the opposite side of what everyone else who has been here pre-2021 believes in
I mean literally everything is up though so that’s probably not it at all. VET is right there with DOGE. Most folks just can’t figure out why DOGE is up. It’s a meme that is performing extremely well.

They talked shit on you trying to buy $500 of DOGE at .0032 because at the time, all indications pointed to it being a terrible idea.
""I hate other people being happy""
It won’t.

Prove how wise you are by sending me 30k. Only unwise people don't send me 30k.
Everyone knows this is a gamble. The coin itself was made as a joke, there's litterally no value in investing in dogecoin other than it being a meme. I'm so glad for those who made Bank on this, but in no way is this a smart play.
Stop dumpin your anger on people and making up false narratives. 

I never said he wasn't smart. 
I backed him 100% in being the only one who said it was a great idea, I just didn't have the capital to do it myself or I woulda. 

Seriously... I hate people like you that go online just to start fights. Die in a fire.
if they were to dump all 30%, would value go down by 30% ?  Does it work like that?
The pump is the reason for the pump
Doge is big because it is well known. Just like Bitcoin. Other than that it doesn’t offer much lol
I bought doge last year and never sold it just hoping to get huge profits and now it's a WOW for me doge saves my financial problems lol. Looking forward to this coins to VET, CAKE, INFI, GRPL, BTT, and EBOX to give me huge profits in the next 5years.
GameStop pumped and fomo hit a lot of people, mass adoption of robinhood by new retail investors, hype died down people notice doge is cheap and listed on robinhood, wallstreetbets mentality totally absorbs r/dogecoin, now all those clueless people with all the GameStop/diamond hands energy are flooding the whole crypto space. 

It’s funny just read the threads on r/dogecoin. It’s like they don’t realize that cryptocurrencies aren’t stocks. A lot of people are going to get burned hard. 

There’s a post with a a bunch of people talking about how they’re millionaires and that they’re holding. If they know anything they’d cash out and buy actual Bitcoin and a hardware Wallet.

Instead they’re just letting it ride in robinhood..
Find a good example of a famous pump n dump from their era, or try referencing the .com bubble
Literally they won't be the only ones, and this is what will drive the price up lmao
You don't own crypto on robinhood. You own the right to look at a piece of text on the app that says you do. But you can't withdraw it. Amazes me it ever got this far really.
So, they’re up 50% already😂. While your advice was probably the best to give at the time, the timing of events that happened today probably means they won’t be listening to you in the future for any investment advice unless they get burned bad.
Your parents are children, I would use this in court to argue their mental incompetence. You should be in charge of their finances
I will take dogecoin meme coin over government printed pieces of promise paper any day
I was hoping to get here first but ayyyyyyyyyyyy, I told my family a month ago to open a binnce account and get on vechain, only my auntie did, she rocks, the rest can visit us on the private island when its true value is realised.

also if she'd put the money in when i told her instead of 3 weeks after she'd have top end lambo money. but atleast shes seen some good gains over the past week.
Is there a fundamental reason why is VeChain pumping? Tempting to finally dump my bags from the last market cycle.
Polkamon is listed 3rd among the top 10 most promising low cap projects that are not listed on a CEX yet ...$PMON all the way.
Dogs go to vets right?
Nah I'm not kidding actually. But you're right that ""good crypto"" is a bad choice of words. I think most people here know what I mean tho 

And my father was a Circle jerking noob, so be careful how you talk about them around me.
How did you do that?? 🤔☺️
I've bought the ath on btc at 27k, 33k, 41k, 55k, it's been working out pretty well so far. Yea most of it was gotten at 10k before the surge but there's nothing wrong with averaging in at aths, those becomes the new lows in time
I think by easily accessible it also means the price is low enough that having more ""shares"" per dollar spent gives noobs the idea they're early in the project considering the next crypto on the list is ETC and it's $25 a coin. I bet a lot of people who hold doge on Robinhood that scream doge to $1 on Twitter knows that dogecoin is a top 11 crypto with a market cap of $17b for no reason other than being a meme
I thought it’s because btc was limited to 21m coins long term and doge could keep putting out endless supply
Doge coin mints 10,000 coins per minute, there are currently 129 billion doge coins and rising. Terrible inflation, worst than USD. 

BITCOIN only has a maximum of 29 Million, making it rare and worth its price.
If your coin requires a billionaire to manipulate the markets for you to start seeing profits, perhaps it wasnt the safest choice
Exactly this
Which is where they should stay....
Let it go man, had 330k doge in a hardware wallet. Learn from your past mistakes but don't sit on them. Trust your gut and don't listen to other people's opinions no matter how informed.
I'm super wise

Now how do I wire 30k to a stranger on reddit
Been holding over a year. Bought in at .0013 ...in a little over a year with a steady climb my 20 bucks is almost 2 thousand.   How was that not smart? I'm going to hold until I hit another comma.
Hahaha cry baby boy
well, I'm aware it'll dump more as others see a huge red candle. but would this 1 person solely be reponsible for a 30% drop (if it works that way).
Funny right
What it did have to offer was that it was a great way to get a lot of a crypto and impress newcomers with ""1000 Dogecoins"" or a gag gift like I did a few years ago because it has a cute shiba inu on the paperwallet 

I love the coin, but it's weird to me that they are currently worth this much. They are intended to be almost worthless to be able to gift impressive sounding amounts
Just curious have you researched these currencies(VET,CAKE,INFL,GRPL,BTT,EBOX) or just gambling
This really explains a lot, thanks!
Enron is a company nearly everyone should know
I think the .com bubble is a good example, I clearly told them on tuesday that we shouldn’t use robinhood since they have such limited options, the stock market is hard asf man. I don’t have time to do trading in the day and a lot of the things there are LONG time investments, i told her to use coinbase or binance or crypto.com, tf did we make accs for if ur not even gonna use them
You cannot withdraw it?? What? I’ve never heard that before.

I don’t use it just curious
I told them this
I bought 1k, was this predictable that they were gonna make 50%? No, thats the thing. 
ITS. 
A.
GAMBLE.
Sure, everything is a gamble but who knows where doge is gonna go?
Amazing 😂
Auntie is a real G
First of all, I think the price will increase further because this project has a real product & use case so I’m not surprised but I think there is some kind of FOMO at the moment. Remember one thing in the bull market: sometimes you have to take your profit so if you want to sell something, sell your inlay & leave the rest of it
Ofcourse
Tradingview.com a lot of the marketplaces have the same charts.
What does ath mean??
ripple is cheap as shit too and at least has an actual business case behind it. I don't hold any, but man if you want cheap crypto at least buy something that has some sort of value proposition and isn't just a meme lol
I hear ya, but I don’t see how having a trend of early investors making a misplaced assumption about value is a good thing for a project. To me it sounds like a lot of weak hands will invest and then get dumped on when the major holders start to take profit. I believe big holders will inevitably take profit because of the endless (literally endless) pressure of an ever-increasing supply. Don’t get me wrong. I have some doge myself, but I am ready to dump it like every other person I know (personally) that holds it. So, I get your point about it appearing more accessible, and I do not disagree. I just think that ultimately that point will come back to hurt the coin since it is the typically weak handed early investor who will think that way. Eth and ltc have so much upside too anyways
It's about making money for me.  I'm making the most off doge. Once the hype dies down I'll take my current 7000% profit and move to another coin
It's luck not smart. You did nothing of particularly keen intelligence. Now is your chance to be Intelligent. Smart would be finding creative ways to utilize that asset to increase holdings. Smart and lucky would be finding ways to bet said holdings either for or against future growth and seeing your returns multiply.  😉 🎲🌚
Die in a fire, childish shit.
I know VET and Cake but not so familiar with GRPL.can you tell me about it please.
Enron is not a relevant example and has no parallels
Nope. On robinhood you can't withdraw your crypto. It has to stay there, you can withdraw in fiat, that's all.
I’m not disagreeing with you, just saying that the timing of events might make you look unreliable for investment advice in their eyes.
Plus you can sleep better as soon as you already took out your initial investment 😅👌 you don't even have to panic during a bear market since you are only in with your profit :-)
all time high
XRP is banned in the US atm so ETC is the next cheapest available on RBH. 13 cents vs $26. If you got $20 to spend having 150 shares looks better than 0.75 shares to a first time investor
No its been steadily climbing since I've bought in.  At worst it's just a stable coin.   But right now we got 2 people with way too much influence. Musk and Cuban just pumping it up like crazy. I got in before that.  I seen musk get on board.. I bought more.   I've been doing this for a good long while.  Only thing lucky about it for me was finding it when I originally did. Ride the hype and make a few bucks
huh? it's literally a pump n dump fake company that was one of the most popular notorious fraud examples in history 

You think it's better to bring up something like MGT a penny stock that trades for 7cents you think that'll help bringing up a tiny company no one knows as an example of a pump n dump penny stock? 🤣🙈 bro you're fuckin clueless the whole point was to name a famous example.

 Just because you're too dense to see the parallels between a massive company rising to insane valuations off no tangible value and a pump n dump doesn't mean they aren't analogous
im sure making 1k in crypto makes me unreliable 😂
oh I still see xrp on my robinhood so I didn't even realize it can't actually be purchased
No now isn't the time to be smart? Despite your disagreement I'm going to take my gambling money and double it down.  What do I have to lose?
>bro you're fuckin clueless


I literally had a single sentence comment, you really read into things lmao what is wrong with you


I agree, Enron is one of the best known examples of accounting fraud and financial crime. Doge may be a shit investment but is not inherently fraudulent. Thus, my single sentence stands, it is an irrelevant example
Rekt
There’s gotta be some misunderstanding somewhere. Did you not say that you told them not to buy Doge , then they did this morning? If you tell them not to do something and they go against your advice and do it anyway and it ends up extremely profitable for them that same day, then yes, that would make you unreliable (in their eyes). I don’t know anything about you or your investment strategies other than that doge is a shit coin(which I agree with) and am not judging your reliability for investment advice in general. Just saying that it happened to be bad timing for you to tell them not to buy. Of course nobody could predict a 50% jump in a few hours
I hope you do double down dude. But you're the one who said it's not smart, its luck. Have a good one im good on this convo
thx 😎😏
I told them this coin was being pumped like crazy due to elon musk, i explained to them the day he stops talkin about it is most likely the day it dies, now they’re asking me before buying cryptos, got a text “is stellar lumens good” i told them “yeah i’ve been telling you since october”,

they have the habit of not actually doing things theyre told, they lost like 100 in the stock market, i told them the stock market is difficult, they simply cant get a grasp of what people tell them 🤦‍♂️
Lol thanks for telling me.
tf, my mother just said its her money and she wants in robinhood, the fuck? Okay, thats fine but why the fuck does she keep asking me if these cryptos are good? shit pisses me off so much, like why the fuck bother me if you’re not gonna but this shit, ive been telling her about xrp, ethereum, and everything and NOW she fuckin ask me about it and she doesn’t even fucking buy it and waste my time? shit has me on edge cause she does this in real life situations, she never seems to take shit serious. she always is late whenever we have an important event, shes there last minute.
a while ago we took a flight to cali and guess was, she overslept and was basically late, she got lucky enough because they were about to close the doors “maybe she’s just tired” she had 2 weeks off before the flight, she decision to pack her bag literally at 12 am, istg bro"

Cheers dude, more people need to see this tweet. 

I rarely visit any Telegram groups related to finance anymore, a lot of shilling and rug pulling going on for most, some are genuine, there was only one that did have a launch live stream on telegram which was cool confirming airdrops, sadly due to dolphin royale token\[DRT\] I cannot trust many people after seeing my investment get rug pulled, its not a lot but enough to damage trust.

Damn for real I just tested it just to be 100% sure I’ve put 20 euro in it and lost it but now we are 100% sure that dude made 56k confronted him on telegram that bitch blocked me lol at least have the balls to talk to someone when you scam them
Yup not easy to trust nowadays would be fun to be in a normal group where you can trust each other
That scamming piece of shit just made 56k today saw all the transfer that were made
What!? You lost 22thousand ??? Hoe did you recover it ?
can you pls confirm how you ""lost"" it? a friend tried his pump last week and said he wasn't able to swap the tokens back, kept seeing an error on pancakeswap around not being able to estimate gas fees.
You still have the details of the scammer?
Same story with my 20$ test. He blocked me when I wrote big thank you for stealing my crypto 'savings'.
That’s how you lose your money he locks it so you can’t swap if you change the slippage to 49 you still can’t swap
You can text him on telegram I confronted him and he blocked me lol so you know it’s a scam

"Former President Trump says ""our currency is crashing and will soon no longer be the world standard."""	56.0	https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1643418270756732930	"There’s a reason China is buying up as much gold as it can find…
He’s not wrong. Now that Brazil and China are conducting future trades in their own currency, all of our exported inflation is coming back home.
The short answer is the US dollar is 60% of the world's transactions.  Brazil has said this about China before.   So have the Saudis There is an interesting video on this from a non-US political source (UK) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WJsYkYNz3M
When you find out it’s all fake … fake zeros on a computer screen
I hate to say it, but he is right. It doesn’t take a brain surgeon or a stupid former president to know that.
He’s right. Do some research. And no I’m not going to do it for you and cite sources. And no that’s not how it works here. You have a brain I think. So use it.
That's the plan
The dollar is already over.
This stupid shit always makes me laugh. What out there has enough faith behind it to replace the US dollar? Do people seriously trust China or Russia? Two countries that have been known to manipulate their currencies? The idea that the world’s population is going to put their faith into an authoritarian shit hole is hilarious.
He is correct on that.
[deleted]
Yeah! He’s probably right , HE made sure of it ! 
Just like he’s responsible for his people spreading crap online telling people to take their money out of banks and telling us in people “not to buy anything” 
He’s single-handedly trying to destroy the economy to make Biden look bad so the Democrats don’t win in 2024.

It’s insane to me that someone could be so heartless to watch small businesses go under people lose their homes kids having to drop out of college because the economy is bad and you’re the one doing it.
Interesting how Brics wouldn’t be where it is today if it wasn’t for Donald trump. I guess this is what happens when a man running for president gets caught up in kgb komprimat.
Trump selling fear…as his followers eat it up and send him money.
And he’s not wrong which is the suck part.
Who gives a flying rats ass what this cult leader spews out of his cake eater mouth??? Quit giving him a platform!!!
...and he helped.
Considering every word out of his mouth is fucking bullshit, I'd say that makes the USD look pretty good.
All those people trying to use dollar bills in Europe are going to be unhappy now.

&#x200B;

Maybe he was just talking about drug dealers or maybe his bribes world wide?
The orange fool is in putin pocket
Yeah because Trump himself spiked our national debt by over $8 trillion. Good thing he got his name on those stimmy checks though.

https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/banking/national-debt-by-president/

Horrible ROI in that spend, and it was grossly mismanaged.
I think the world would be a better place if he stopped saying
Good
I doubt it.
I'm so tired of hearing this crap.The Yawn is printed at four times the rate of the United States dollar printing. It's not accessible. You can't buy it. It's truly manipulated currency. Oh I'm sorry I forgot Russia who's economy is Three quarters the size of Texas's economy on a good day. Give me a break.
Did someone pay him to say it? Brought to you by carls Jr.
Trump is well know as a liar.
Western Economy or Eastern Economy. I'm picking Western 10/10 times.  Later global poors!
Looney tunes.
I’ve been hearing this for over 20 years
He also said he'd give us free healthcare.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQFItVBKlAU
Because people think gold, or any other tangible, isn't as much a fiat as the dollar is.
Gold only has value because two people say it does. It has zero value in survival mode.

Only food and clean water have power.
The USA is no longer the world currency. You think home prices are bad now...
For now tho
For a stupid man he’s right about a lot of things
Our currency isn't crashing..
No they’re not called libtards for a reason.
Lol
And it is your honest opinion that trusting the US is better? The single most imperialist country that has ever existed? The country that led the West's neoliberal exploitation of the entire Global South?

Yeah, I can totally see many, many countries (not in the West, of course) trusting China over the US.
15 years ago,  Brazil was supposed to be the 4th biggest economy in the World.  How'd that turn out? I'm bullish on America, because if we hurt the world hurts.
People also forget that the US has oil in the ground to supply itself for a 1000 year if i remember correctly. Send some to us EU homeys, will ya? ;)

broke watch is still shows the correct time twice a day.
Lol not even close, go look at a chart of the USD against all other currencies and you’ll see the opposite has occurred in the last couple of years
I mean the US Dollar is in fact beginning to lose its reserve status. There is plenty of data out there to back this up.  

I agree he is weaponizing it to his benefit, but it is starting to happen.
At this point, Trump's statements are like fatwas issued by a nutjob Ayatollah.
Nah I mean this is old news tbh
Biden is in chinas pocket
And Biden's in Xi's...we're F'd!  Here's hoping 47 is neither of them.
Truth
Our money is going to be replaced. I don’t like him but he’s correct.
Mmmmm, I’m pretty sure its to back their currency, which will be necessary as the developing global reserve currency, especially considering the USD is solely backed by the good faith of the US government, and we all know what a shitshow that’s become.
Do you know what fiat is?
That’s because of inflation though, not from the dollar losing global status. That would cause home prices to dip.
Home prices are dropping and will continue to drop.
First, the US isn’t the “single most imperialist country that has ever existed”. Many others were far more imperialistic, most notably the British & the Mongols. Second, when was the last time the US took over a country? 

The trust, as it pertains to economics, is about whether a country’s currency is reliable. How could a currency that is subject to unilateral manipulation be a reserve currency? You understand the ramifications to smaller economies if the reserve currency value changes, right?
Our oil underneath us may as well be on mars when you have a net zero admin refusing to let us use it and instead would rather beg MBS to pretty please sell us some more of theirs at astronomical prices.
I’m pretty sure we’ve been sending our European allies all kinds of stuff: oil, natural gas, weapons. The US tends to have its allies’ backs, as long as isolationists aren’t in power here.
And?
I try to tell this to people all the time. I try to also reference that there is 80 trillion dollars in sovereign debt. We good.
[deleted]
It's not losing its reserve status. Lol.
Trump killed the TPP which did more to benefit the CCP than anything a President has done since that idiot Nixon allowed trade with them.

The TPP would have kept the CCP in check for decades but the idiot stable genius just couldn’t allow anything with Obama’s name to live… or he traded it to the CCP for something dumb like brand protection for his moronic brand.
Oh for sure.  That's why he signed the Chip Act to help Xi build chips in the US.  Wait...
Point being, gold has as much faith as anything else... meaning using it to back a currency is like using a currency to back a currency. It's just silly
Yep
No sir, the massive amount of US dollars flowing back into the US to stay has been and will continue to cause greater than normal inflation. Combine that with the trillions being made and it’s nuts.
My house is up 3% this month. 40 year mortgages are going to ensure that home prices explode in the US.
Only in the high tax states.
We took over Iraq in 2003 and we finally just sorta left but we are just a phone call away all they have to do is pick up phone and say oil
The US instituted a coup in Gran Columbia to split the country into now Columbia and Panama to create the Panama Canal.

We tax the US Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico without any government representation.

We overthrew the Hawaiian Monarchy. 

We committed  to War of Vietnam despite it having nothing to do with us as it was a French Colony that they lost control of. 

The Cuban Missile Crises was a lie the government strummed up because Cuba was receiving aid from Russia. There weren’t any nukes, but there were missiles. The country is sovereign and had no reason to attack America. We embargo the hell out of this island nation with literal ship blockades.

We destabilize the Middle East for resources. There were no nukes there during Bush Administration so awe lord again.

We’ve committed several other coups on sovereign nations to retain hegemony.

The way the Nukes we dropped on Japan killed between 130k to 230k people. Most of which were civilians.

 The other military bombings have killed 65k+ civilians in the Middle East. 

We’re an empire that commits a ton of war crimes that facade as a Federation of the free. We have no issue throwing our own allies under the bus.
Yes, at 10 times the price of Russian gas. So wholesome. As one US exporter was quoted by Business Insider ""it's insane, we are not talking profit margins any more, but profit multipliers"".

I am pretty sure Europe has to pay for all that weapons too, destroying their own military industry in the process.

After plundering Europe and crashing the EU trade balance overnight, the US then instituted Inflation Reduction Act, which means every European business that didn't move to China, will move to the US. EU officials protested but were sent home packing by the US representatives with cynical ""it's your problem"".

Truly, the US ""have their allies' back"", or as Kissinger would say ""To be an enemy of the US is dangerous, but to be the US' ally, is deadly.""

By now it's clear to everyone, that slowly declining US empire will cannibalise its ""allies"" as much as it can, before finally being reduced to 2nd rate power.
Still more trustworthy than a pseudo-dictatorship
It is happening regardless of your personal risk assessment of reality.
Yea i love this made up narrative that Biden's a china shill, when dumpty has all sorts of ties, investments, & assets in china...finagled a friendly deal for the daughter in the country too, its incredible how folks turn stuff on it's head & start spouting it like the gospel
If the dollar was backed by gold and we were still on the gold standard then it wouldn’t becoming as worthless as it is. You can’t print gold but you can print a shit ton of money and keep diluting the value which is what we have been doing for way to long. The chickens are coming home to roost and the dollar is going to be good for nothing but lining the chicken coop at the rate we’re going.
> gold has as much faith as anything else

Gold is built on the premise that you need colliding neutron stars to make it in bulk, and few people have these lying around.
That’s not because of these currency discussions though… my point was that your comment about the us losing status leading to higher asset prices isn’t true, the us losing status would decrease us home prices.
Inflation has been coming down, and will continue to.
I just saw that. Now you can pay for the entire house 10 times during the life of the loan. Wonderful.
Doubt it. Cycles are going to cycle.
The US didn’t take over Iraq. It isn’t the 51st state or a US territory. You realize China has been busy setting up predatory infrastructure loans all over Africa, right?
I’m very well versed in history, my man. Nothing you brought up was recent. Is Panama part of the US? The US Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii ARE all part of the US (only Hawaii is a state, the three territories have relatedly voted to remain territories).

The nukes were used on Japan to end the war that they started, and they were warned. We didn’t even know how devastating it would be. There has only been 2 tests prior. So, your 20/20 hindsight in the issue is pretty weak

The Cuban Missile Crisis was absolutely real (even coming down to a Russian submarine captain refusing to follow an order to launch They’re nuclear payload). The entire thing was instigated by Russia, because whether a sovereign nation, or not, the US wasn’t going to, and still won’t, tolerate Russian threats.

Your argument doesn’t actually contradict anything I’ve said. US doesn’t take countries over, and as I’ve repeatedly said, economics is about good faith in a monetary system. That can’t be achieved for centralized, authoritarian regimes with a recent history of shady, financial behavior.
Whatever you say. You probably shouldn’t have ever made yourselves dependent on Russian gas & oil to begin with 🤷‍♂️ And, if it wasn’t for the US protecting you, most of the European continent would have been overrun by hostile powers a long time ago &/or right now. If you actually had to fully pay for your own defense, you also wouldn’t be able to afford all the lavish social programs y’all enjoy. So, distance yourselves from the US at your own risk. Maybe Putin & Xi will be kinder than we are…
Trump or desantis?
Lol, no it's not.  Some countries are agreeing to settle in other currencies, but that's just because US inflation is \_relatively\_ worse right now, so they dont feel like paying the fees.  But once one/any of those countries hiccups (again) like a hint of a coup in Brazil, or Xi cracking down a little too hard, or the Saudis seeing a terrorist attack-- everyone will come running back to NYC to re-do their contracts back in USD.
We can devalue anything. Let's assume finite amount of gold... we did... for many many years. And guess what? Its value continued to be measured in dollars, not the other way around. Any medium used to translate labor into value can be abused.
Yet the value of gold changes, is not constant, and is based on the dollar
How so? Those trillions of US dollars have to go some place.
!RemindMe 8 months
I won’t take your word for it and will continue to buy gold and silver
And anyone with an ounce of sense will be further locked out of the home market. No. I wont pay $1m for a 1600 sq ft rancher on no land, at 7.5% for 40 years. Meanwhile, the poorest will be kept poor as they jump to be homeowners.
So they are imf now or world bank?
“Apart” of the US with 0. You mean taxation without representation right?  We overthrew the Hawaiian Monarchy. 

I’ve read a lot about the Cuban missile crises. Cuba had no nukes. Still they’re under embargo over half a century later. I’m not sure where the Russian threat comes into place here. I do know they hate that Cuba is communist. 

The US literally created Panama for the sake of that Panama Canal.

It took 4 nukes and over 120k people to realize how effective they were. Sure, but we dropped 2. Far much damage the the single Pearl Harbor attack.

You may actually be delusional. The US is an empire is retains global hegemony through economics and military. Just because we aren’t actively governing places directly doesn’t mean we aren’t maintaining imperial power. No matter how long ago some of these things happened an Empire isn’t built in a day.
What is this drivel? Overrun by whom? What “lavish” social programs? Jesus Christ you Americans are brainwashed with your shitty exceptionalism…
Fuck both of those douches
It absolutely is. https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/central-banks-bought-most-gold-since-1967-last-year-wgc-says-2023-01-31/
Brazil is a democracy there won't be no coup
At least when we had gold standard minimum wage was a dollar a dollar was an ounce of 90% silver. Today minimum wage is 7.25 a dollar can’t buy my much for perspective an ounce of 90% silver should be 22.50. Our currency is almost 1/100 what it used to be.
Not really if there is a finite amount of it. And we don’t have to assume that. We already know that. Dollar values aren’t measured in gold since we came off of the gold standard. The gov does not like backing dollars now with gold or anything else since they can’t control the economy unless the can control how many dollars are a available. Good in some ways but that’s when eventually you push around wheelbarrows full of cash to buy a six pack.
The human value of gold certainly changes over time, and is relative. Paper fiats are but a brief blip in human history of about 50 kYears -- US dollar being the new kid on the block, and Bretton-Woods having ended only 1971, so the experiment is half a century old. And is not working in terms of store of value very well, empirically.

A more interesting comparison is gold priced in other scarce metals, like silver, platinum, palladium or copper. The latter being effectively constant since ~1980. Oil (WTI) priced in gold has been largely constant since ~1975 as well.
More capital would flow to whatever countries/currencies replaced the dollar if the us lost its current status.

OK. Just ignore data and do your thing.
Like the multi-generational mortgages that Japan had. This is why so many people are moving to the flyover states. Land and houses are cheap… for now.
Basically
If you seriously believe authoritarians are more trustworthy than the US, then you 100% ARE delusional
I don’t think we’re exceptional. I’m just pointing out that the fact that ppl rioting in France because the retirement age went up by 2 years says a lot. Imagine having to increase your military budgets by 40, 50+%. How are you going to afford things like socialized medicine & higher education. It’s just math 🤷‍♂️ The US has basically subsidized European defense since WWII, b/c our allies were more than happy to lean on us as the muscle.
How does that support the argument? Central banks sometimes move more into gold, sometimes less. USD didn't lose reserve status decades ago when the same thing happened.
[deleted]
In terms of metal, yes. Kinda my point, how arbitrary it is.
Gold may be finite but it's still measured in dollars
So you are saying that more US dollars will flow to whatever countries replaced the dollar? That doesn't make sense. If you have pesos and live in Canada, where do you end up spending your pesos? To say they end up in the US is nonsensical. Currencies go where they are spent, and if the USD is no longer being spent all over the world, they will eventually make their way home and increase the money supply.
It depends where in the ivory tower you sit if inflation is coming down still looks really high here on main st
The difference is that there is zero oversight for the CCP, whereas the IMF & World Bank have some oversight under the UN
I didn’t say that. I’m saying we are an Imperial power and single handedly the most powerful country in the world.

If I were another country, I wouldn’t trust the US any further then I can throw them simply because mutual interest is not in the US playbook.

Trusting currency is fine you best believe the dollar will continue to be backed by military might.
And, in case you haven’t been paying attention to your own backyard, you’d be overrun by Russia.
Did you read the article?
The beginning of that process is happening. All of the evidence is pointing to it.
It’s sorta a tradition 2000 years ago you could buy a fine suit with an ounce of gold and guess what? You still can.
Any medium of exchange is tied to labor, not some farcical metal. Print more money = increasing price of metal per ounce
Here on main Street it's been coming down more than in your ivory tower.
Doesn’t brics member countries have oversight of Brics policies? I would not call that no oversight.
I’m not sure what you’re arguing. We’re discussing the idea of the US dollar being supplanted by something else as the global reserve currency. You are stating that the US is the most powerful country in the world, which is absolutely true and only further bolsters the idea that the US dollar will remain the global standard for the foreseeable future 🤷‍♂️
Yes. Did you?
If you walk into a tailor and try to pay with gold, they're going to weigh it and look up how many dollars it's worth. So, no, you can't buy a suit with gold without its value being measured in dollars.
Yeah no it hasn’t, gas is four dollars cereal is seven a loaf a bread is 5 dollars and my coffee is like 7 bucks too, don’t even get me started on cigarettes I wish no one ever did.
China and Russia provide so much assurance! Lmao
So, I’m arguing against the idea that the US isn’t an Imperial power is all. The distrust can stem from other countries being bullied by the US and being fed up by it.
Yep. Central banks purchasing the largest amount of gold reserves in about 50 years. Starting a new trend deviating from reserves so heavily in USD.
Sure you can because gold isn’t weighed in dollars but in weight based metrics like grams or ounces. Only way to measure with a dollar is if someone draws a ruler on it. Duh
Wasn't gas higher last year? That would be deflation. Get out of the ivory tower wasting $7 on over priced coffee.
That’s only two votes tho of like 9 countries soon to be 26 countries…
That isn’t what this thread is about. I am all about that discussion. I wrote a comprehensive paper on US hegemony in 1999, but that’s not what we’re debating here. This is an economic discussion on the future of the US dollar
And? No where does it say USD is losing reserve status. USD is the most notable reserve currency and not the only one, and it's share fluctuates all the time.
Weight... as in dollars per ounce.
Where I live there is a nickel’s difference in gas and the coffee is just barely worth 7 dollars and can replace a meal. I save 3-4 dollars as opposed to Big Mac meal
9? Who are they? I know of 5 members: Brazil (who I think are trustworthy, but recently altered the value of their currency), Russia (completely untrustworthy), India (fairly trustworthy, but their position on Russia has been troubling), China (completely untrustworthy), & South Africa (rife with corruption). What am I missing?
Well I think the dollar is as risk due to the ever increasing alliance of BRICS+.
Weight? No weigh!
Average US peaked $5 last year in May and now is $3.50. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=12eLt

$7 is a lot for coffee. Bought two for that yesterday.
Bangladesh, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay are members of BRICS New Development Bank.
Okay. That’s what we’re discussing. I don’t think enough of the world is willing to put their economic stability in the hands of BRICS to supplant the USD. Too many of the member states lack enough stability and transparency.
Haha k that's pretty good
It will  be interesting to see what gas’s looks like in may with Saudi and Russian cuts if they even kick in by then I think it could be June. Saudi Arabia becomes a full Brics member I believe on 8/1 so that will apply additional pressure. I really need to go get my coffee lol I am also a 2 a day guy I feel there is great nutritional value the  McDonald’s. Just out of curiosity you have the figure for April?
Okay. Do you think they have the economic power and reputation to supplant the US dollar? I don’t
Well that is in large the problem. Most Western countries have switched to a service economy. They also generally lack materials and labor so they offshore those parts to feed into their own economy.

US has started to rollback child labor laws as a consequence for its shaky labor force.

Destabilization doesn’t have to just be trusting in another countries just put distrust in another countries currencies ability to buy from what I understand.
Yeah can’t resist a pun it’s like economic collapse
Their gdp combined is higher then USA so yes economic power is there. Tying a currency to commodities could be seen as more stable then on a currency that devalues every day and would be based on the commodity’s scarcity. So where as the dollar supports the ground and nation I stand on I do think brics currency could be better. If USA was back on a precious metals standard I might reconsider my position.
Sure, but without trust, they’re GDP is worthless
So what you’re saying is trust a bill you can send out for debt more then say a piece of gold or silver or maybe grain?
I’m saying that you can’t trust authoritarians
Do you think authoritarians trust each other? I guarantee they know their options and for whatever reason have deemed this the best one.  Besides who’s an authoritarian if all that is allowed is a monopoly. I am scared of destabilization of dollar but I think a multipolar world makes more sense then a mono polar world.
They band together in order to further their own interests. If they are able to destabilize the US, they will then turn on each other. It’s the oldest trick in the book - They make the US out to be their bogeyman, so that they can take more power for themselves.
And if you think authoritarians don’t pose a very real threat to global security and international peace, then we really don’t have anything else to discuss
Tada you just described invention of a form of democracy which apparently even authoritarians need
That’s no democracy, dude. Only temporary cooperation
Yeah decisions by committee is democracy. They may not give it to their people but hey at least they are trying it out #babysteps
One they allow it with their people, they will gain global trust. Until then, they have zero chance at overtaking the USD.
Playing democracy with themselves might lead to greater things for their people in future
There are many examples of authoritarians forming alliances. None of them worked out well
Yeah look at trumps administration constantly someone being kicked out
Exactly.
Because democracy overcomes authoritarian regimes eventually
I am not sure I agree with you on that, at all. The only thing that overcame authoritarianism in Germany, Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary, Japan, & Italy was major defeat in wars. Brazil, and since other countries, managed to overcome without a war, but the most powerful authoritarian regimes haven’t (Iran, China, Russia)"

guess they never advertised being secure since representatives have nothing at stake and literally no reason to be honest or to even volunteer to do that job. and since it's not approval based, it's unlikely to represent best candidates.  and there's no sybil protection against tx or account spam since intermittent PoW might as well not exist.

there are significant security and ethical problems with a lot of those unfinished platforms being advertised as usable
rai/iota have proof of work that can cost more or be more inconvenient than a lightning fee.

Lightning has the advantage of letting people who don't care about trading partners not have to deal with the perpetual storage requirement of their transactions.
very true, dont sleep on these coins, however im not really into NANO as its payment focused, i can elaborate on why if youre interested. IOTA at least has data storage on the tangle, so it can be used in other protocols like oyster. so there is a case for adoption there. with nano, im not so sure. it would make the ultimate trading pair, but other than that, im not sold on adoption.
I heard that hashgraph has a pattent for its technology? If it’s true, then it’s a shame. What a small man.
Question: at one point in Novemember when IOTA became the top 5 coin, the network was congested and transactions took hours: why? 

Doesn’t more nodes = faster transaction? So why is it at its peak, the network slowed down instead of speeding up? 


But when though... ""one day""??? 
Would like to know this as well
According to their github.com, sybil attacks are practically no risk. https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/Attacks

Disclaimer: I don't have a full grasp on the technicalities. 
are you talking about lighting network? yeah itll make things cheaper but at the end of the day, when the lighting network channel is closed, the transactions are groups togeather mining is done. so there is still a cost. and in btc, its quite large atm. LN should bring costs down and improve scalability. but imo they should do so much more for BTC to improve it, but too much infighting with devs, we havent seen btc change much at all despite all the issues its encoutered. 

I mean the PoW algo they use is a simple sha256, so that gave rose to ASIC machines which outperform your avg joe trying to mine. this resorts to companies aquiring lots of expensive ASIC machines to mine BTC in countries with cheap electricity, so mining becomes highly centralised, and transactions expensive. they could have at least changed the mining algo to not be so easy computationally. you see other coins doing PoW with more complex ""problems"" to validate the transaciton, take monero for example, its more cpu based. cpu is a general purpose computing device while gpus and esp ASICs are very niche in what they can do, they are great at solving mathetmatical operaitons but limited in waht they can do, great for gaming, great for executing a hash function
I have the same concern for nano, but I think nano has the greatest chance to achieve global adoption, with pre-cache pow it literally can send coins with 1 second from one cellphone to another. What I am betting is, since the team haven’t done any marketing yet, I think they plan to release all the wallets and then fully on marketing and deal with merchants. This could be huge in the next few months.30% my portfolio on it.
Yeah I'm currently not invested in nano, just stating that it shows promise in that it works very well for it's use case. I am invested in IOTA however as I believe that it will be the leading technology for it's use case in the near future, being the backbone for secure communication and payments in a trillion dollar industry (IOT space) with a lot of great partnerships already established, and many great minds collaborating on the project.
That was due to a coordinated DDoS attack on publicly listed nodes. A lot of people were struggling getting off exchanges as well due to the volume. Btw if you switched nodes to a private one transactions actually went through very quickly as usual...

The foundation let the attack continue so that they could gather data and design a solution to avoid this in the future. Since then Roman Semko has developed some great software to deploy and protect nodes from bad actors on the network
The primary issue as I understand it was that IOTA doesn't (or didn't at the time) have automatic peer discovery. IOTA wallet users had to select from a list of known peers to connect to and of course many users just picked the one at the top.

The result was that handful of nodes got slammed with everyone trying to connect to them, instead of everyone forming a nice balanced mesh network.
Because the number of nodes couldnt handle the traffic. The tangle scales with the number of nodes so if there is a huge flood of traffic, those using the public nodes listed in the wallet have a bad time.
The more transaction happen in the network the faster it can get, it’s true, yet it also has a limit. What it actually means is below this limit the more transaction the faster. The problem is they don’t lnow what the limit is, it could be the same limit as nano.
Oyster will use tangle t and Im confident they will deliver a working product in a few months
yes, I should start pointing out I did read that page. The sybil attacks I am talking about are what they call ""penny-spend attack"" & transaction flooding although it can be any amounts as clever as they want to be in their attack so I think the risk is between high and maximum and *rate limit* is exaggeration.
its likely LN channels are never closed.  http://www.naturalfinance.net/2018/02/lightning-network-economics-and.html
yeah thats all good and well, nano is fantastic technology and i agree marketing would really help, the rebrand is less geeky and gives it a name that suggests what it does.

my biggest issue with adoption and pretty much all payment only focused coins is that the coin flucuates relative to your fiat, you also have to have the hassle of buying nano which at this stage means moving money to an exchange where you have to verify yourself. then buy the nano move it to your wallet. you then also have to be your own bank i.e. secure your keys properly, nano ledger is a great step forward but u see my point. lastly there are no charge backs with cryptos.

for all those points combined there is no way i would buy anything normal with cryptos, the exception is, is if i got like 15-20% off a major purchase. but id have to trust the vendor, maybe they are on ebay. and id have to buy the coins asap so the value stays the same.

imo i was really hoping that rai could be incorporated into something like osmigo is doing, mobile phone insert fiat -> out comes other fiat or crytpo. i was excited about the project, but when i read the white paper. it was easily the worst ones ive read. if a protocol like that was developed where your fiat was instantly turned into nano via a decentralised exchange with easy to use software. sure. but so far i havent seen much promise with decentralised exchanges, lack of liquidity and issues with latency being primary ones. Stellar on the ohter hand is making an exchange, not sure if its centralised but the coin is extremly fast 2-3 sec confirmation time, 1500 txs, will incorporate LN, 0.00003$ to send a tran. on that note, raiblocks has competitors with better marketing e.g. stellar so there is that too.
very cool, i did not know the history of this congestion. do you know what iota did to solve the problem?
Ah I see. Was not aware that there was a coordinated attack against IOTA. 

Could you elaborate on how the software Roman Semko developed, worked? Like how did it successfully protect the nodes?
So how are they going to tackle this problem?

Because from what I think you’re saying- that was a huge influx in users who simply bought and “hodl”, thus resulting in an increase in traffic, but not much of a substantial increase in nodes. What if people who get into IOTA don’t care about the IoT aspect of it? And most of them just do what BTC’ers do and simply “hodl” hoping to get rich? 

Sorry for the FUD. This question has been on my mind for a while.
Has anyone tested Byteball: The DAG as a comparison? 
You can easily set a minimum amount to receive in your wallet, and ignore any transactions below that amount (ie set to 2 cents, any attacker needs to send >2 cents to generate load on your wallet). Would be interesting to see the math on how many tx's are necessary to really bring down the network, then translate that to attacker rate of spend.

Also, the 7000 tps rate limit is almost surely exaggerated, as it only considers network bandwidth/transaction file size (as far as I understand). However, this figure gives significant headroom compared to VISA's typical tps (average ~2k, probably peak around 4k on typical days. Though VISA's holiday tps is ~20k, blows Nano out of the water)

Edit: Now that I think about it, I don't know if the minimum-receive filter actually matters. Nodes would desync because they need to keep up with other transactions, so unless every wallet has their minimum-receive filter set at or above a given threshold, the attack could succeed by exploiting wallets with weaker filtering. Hopefully someone with more technical understanding can chime in
ill have a read thanks, i cant wrap my head around a channel never being closed because i thought the channel had to eventually be closed so it can go on the ledger, transactions verified by miners. very cool and promising if true. might actually save btc, but im so doubtful of that coin. other coins are also incorporating LN like stellar, its in their road map. they already outperform btc easily 0.0003$ to send a tran, 1500tx/ps, and 2-3 sec confirmation time. thats ""good enough"" for something like nano to lose out on adoption.
New node software seems to have solved this. The only things holding IOTA back as far as I can tell, is user adoption, more nodes on the network and easier accessibility (new exchanges / wallet). All of these things are happening, new wallet coming in a few weeks that solves all the common complaints, more exchanges are rolling out with their new 'hub' IXI, and adoption will likely improve very quickly after these two things. Should be a promising year for IOTA
Here you go: 
http://iotafeed.com/index.php/2017/12/11/roman-semko-carriota-nelson-in-a-nutshell/

Development has progressed a lot further since then but this post explains the basic concept. He has developed a lot of great node software, including for use with dynamic IP and single click deployment
once adoption occurs it will settle itself out, oyster is using the tangle, and they are releasing their first itteration of their product. so youll get more nodes there already.

but you raise a good point about HODLs, im one of them, im not using the tangle. but hopefully there are other projects out there using it which will scale the network. oyster promises big things, disrupting the advertising industry i.e. no ads, and cheaper encrypted data storage relative to cloud hosting providers. i do have questions around the project though so i hit up the devs on telegram. but if they pull it off, its huge. enough perhaps to add enough nodes to the tangle, each browser for intance will be a node.
There has been a substantial increase of nodes since then, because of project like bolero (1 click node setup). But even with people hodling, there will be significant transfer of data that will also strengthen the network.
There is only a small list of nodes listed in the light wallet currently, and those were getting hammered (or even ddos'ed at some point).
Developments in node software currently are things like Nelson.cli for automatic neighbouring of nodes, and Field.cli for automatic node balancing and incentivization which should help prevent nodes from becoming overloaded.
Minimum receive filter is to protect receive address wallet. So it isn't wasting CPU for pennies. Nodes do no care, they just check signature+pow+forks.

Resource requirement to generate transactions (PoW) are way higher than resources required to validate it.

The way you can force network out of sync - is to carry pre-computed fork choice attack. But the costs are growing exponentially with each branch.

This is the reason PoW is required for `receive`. Not to protect from spam (it is already protected by `send` PoW), but to protect from multiple `receive` sent in different order (N! options). Forcing network to vote on forks.
>  the channel had to eventually be closed so it can go on the ledger, transactions verified by miners. 

You can always spend funds on LN instead of closing.  Pretty assured that it will always be cheaper to do so.  Closing is done if counter party is unresponsive, or as an attempt to cheat.

LN is faster than XLM, and fees are free for direct routes, and may be cheaper than XLM indirectly (or at least be comparable).  LN is backed by more provable tech and decentralization than others.

rai/iota have the problem of limited single node spending tps, with iota having broken-by-design signature scheme."
