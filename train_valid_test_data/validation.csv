I haven’t really checked out the indi yet, but man I like your style.  

I can help with your website, maybe convert to TOS, idk other stuff too probably.  Feel free to pm  if you need anything.  You rock.

OMG I love to know that people like you, unselfish and caring for the little people are here and willing to help others with nothing in return than the satisfaction of helping. Thank you so much!👌🙏🙏
I used this today and had great success with entering trades. Much appreciated!
Been using it all week - pretty great!
anyway to do this in TOS?
you got a twitter or something? I am willing to follow I would love to see a youtube video. I am brand new too this (Only like 4 months in total but using a real broker, Thinkorswim, I am brand new this will be really helpful!) Thank you
Straight up gentleman. Net positive in this world🤌🏻

Hey man appreciate what you’re doing!
I’ve downloaded it & am trying to figure it out now. Honestly, I’m probably too dumb & new to trading to figure out how to use it, or utilize it anywhere near it’s capabilities.
Thank you for developing it & not charging for it. Very cool!
I think I used the prediction charts right & it’s prediction is right where I was estimating. 
So, anyway, thanks!! 🙏🏽
Very cool. Thank you
I mean you are monetizing it though- nothing wrong with that I mean it’s hard work and you probably should- but if you go to your website you’ve got all sorts of paid products....
Thanks so much for sharing this.
thx dude !
Will this work for swing trade entry & exit as well? If so, how would the settings need to be adjusted?
what does gray bar mean? momentum accumulating?
Hi! Thanks for sharing, can you explain a little more on how to tune the settings? cant see the code so i can not know what changes are the different values doing :)
Thanks for sharing a you tube series would be great. What is your website??
I would be very interested in a YouTube series. Are you planning on doing some beginner-friendly material or just more advanced stuff? I'm a new trader and having a hard time finding good resources to learn more that aren't packed full of words and concepts that I don't understand.
cool! thanks will be back testing this on SPY! id love to see whatever youtube series you make.
I am still not very sure how to use the information you have shared (disclaimer: never used TradingView before, I am not good with any TA). Are you able to make a YouTube video for us noobs perhaps? Thanks for not being selfish btw, we have enough of those to last us many lifetimes. :)
Thanks
Awesome tool. You're a legend.
Thank you very much for your kind contribution!
Dude I haven't even looked yet which I am going to do but I just want to say bravo and it's refreshing to see this type of mentality in the world.
I’m not experienced with using Trading View. I have a TV account and the app on my phone, but never used it. How do I load this indicator into TV? Thanks a million!
Any video available yet to help us all better understand how to use this?
I LOVE YOU🥺👉🏼❤️👈🏼
When you are done with the tutorial please edit this post I’d love to find anything that could lend an edge to the system.
Any chance you can add a toggle for those of us who are red-green color blind?  The toggle could simply change the color scheme. Thanks for publishing this either way.
Thank you!!, looking forward to YouTube or any other updates!
Seems like a less accurate version of the MACD Histogram no? Why is that last bar green with so much selling pressure?
You sure you don’t want to sell this as an NFT per indicator ? Might mike a few hundred million off it :) 

Thank you though .. this is great work!
How has this changed your profiles liquidity?
How has this changed your profiles liquidity?
Can I get a tv account without signing up and use the indicator? I have too many brokers already😬.
Money doesn't make anyone selfish.
Anyone who believes it does must hate anyone with money or anyone trying to make money. 
Therefore, your unconscious bias against money means it can't possibly work.
Love this thing...I’m going to start backtesting tonight...awesome work!  Anyway to get this for TOS would be great as well.  Looking forward to the YouTube video
How does it work exactly
Allah keep you happy ❤️

I have a Trading View Pro account and tried it and the EMA and ATR or missing. All that's been added is the VSI on bottom and it looks very blurry. Basically my chart looks nothing like yours. What am I doing wrong? 

Thanks for helping people by the way.
I must get 50 emails a day from self proclaimed multimillionaires trying to sell 99.00 books on investing.
Do the indicator give you the sign on when to enter the trade if you buying or selling
Thank you very very much. Greatly appreciate it
Man I might have to add this to my confirmation tools just to see if it supports the trades I would take anyways ... cool stuff!
Please teach how to use this?
Lazy strategy that actually works: go to open insider and look at the latest cluster buys (not insider buys those don’t mean shit for the direction of the stock price) and buy 5 things that the rich people bought on the same day. At least 4 of them will go up. This is a trick I sometimes use and this is not financial advice
Is there a way you can tweak it for long term swing trading? 6 months to year long holds?
I didn’t click on your link yet, but it sounds interesting. I will give it a go. 
I am sure that we can spread that far. I will read and give it a go on german pages. 
👍🏻👍🏻
I fuckin love the fact that you checked your own urge for greed and instead did a solid to your fellow human.

Good man!
Fucking aye. Men becoming  bigger envious assholes and women whoring away And hey when during Covid exactly was it OK to be a whore again?

How about 2000 quid
Bravo
Thanks! Much appreciated. I would definitely be interested in your YouTube video. I'll save this post as well.
Sometimes am not getting good trades, am finally realizing that I have almost the same money. I haven’t lost my account because I risk 0.5% and keep that very tight
Awesome stuff.
You should have at the very least provided your cash app for donations. It’s the least we can do for your generosity. This is really nice!
I suck at trading man.. Can I just hook up my Binance API with you & share 50/50 on net profits? 😁🙏
only found this post today, but I look forward to seeing the video about potential uses for the indicator, thank you for what you do
Cannot wait to try playing around with this.  Anyone find the successful tweaks that are spot on?  So just to be clear as I am an idiot.  This is only for Trading View?  Correct?  What is the exact name of it on Trading View?  Sorry for the stupid question.  I'm new. :)
Thank you!!

Is this something that you’ve largely used on currencies/forex etc? Or have you used this on stocks etc as well? Have been using it over the last few days just see what happens and it looks good but wanted to check before I start back testing aka spending hours looking over charts to realise it’s not great for stocks 😂 top work though 👍.
Please do a ToS version!
I have not used it in a strategy yet, as I believe it to be a better complimentary indicator to price action that a standalone, but I could build a strategy out of it if there is demand for it.
Glad to hear it! Be sure to share this tool with others when you get the chance
You said you used it. Did you have to open TradingView (TV) first then come here? I’m kind of lost on how to use this in TV. I primarily use TOS to chart. This post seems so beneficial though.
How do I use this? 

I have been using 9 ema + support/resistance/breakout for entries
Nope
You'd have to code it yourself
You're welcome. Please look forward to the tutorial video for this indicator I will be uploading some time next week!
I dont have a website, yet, but even when I do I probably will have most if not everything free on there.
I would play with the number of days back variable to like 7, 14, 21 or 30. I am not a swing trader myself but I think it would help with giving insight into the buying/selling pressure on any time frame.
Gray bar means no specific momentum is calculated yet. I should note that this should only be used as a confirmation indicator once a candle has closed, it can give some wild reading on a candle that is still open.
Yes I should probably add more descriptive detail to the tunable variables. Basically the ""smoothing period"" is the period of the orange signal line, which is basically just a smoothed moving average of the histogram. You can also increase its amplitude (size) for greater visibility. Number of days past is how many days the indicator looks back (limited to a thousand bars) for the max and min of the volume/volatility combo. Then the current histogram bar is comparing itself to the max, so values above the green dotted line indicate strong buying power and bars below the red line indicates strong selling power.

I also use the default settings in my current system, so I have tinkered too much with them myself.
I do not yet have a website, but it is something I am considering. I will have more details on a YouTube series soon.
Yes my youtube series would be aimed at new and unprofitable traders, focused on building/testing strategies and becoming consistent.
Let me know how it goes! I will make an announcement when my youtube series goes live. Since there has been high demand for me to explain the uses I've found so far with this indicator, I will be putting that up sometime next week.
After you click the link, scroll down until you see a blue button that says add to favorites, then you should be able to put it on your chart by selecting the ""indicators"" tab above the chart area. Hope it helps you like it has me, best of luck!
Still in the works! First time using an animation software but my goal is to have it finished by this weekend, sorry for the wait.
Will do! Sorry that it is taking some time, but patience is a good skill to have in this game anyway haha
Oh of course, I will update that asap.
Okay update is live, and you can now customize the bullish/bearish to any color you like. I appreciate the feedback. Happy trading!
YouTube video is slow going but I am working on it haha. I'll post the link when I get it done
You definitely have to play with the settings for each time frame, but its different from the MACD cuz it is based off of price action (candle structure), volume and volatility.  I recommend using it as a confirmation to other technical analysis. 

I will dive into that more in the video as to why it is sometimes green when there is a lot of selling pressure, but it is basically reading that there is a bullish price action however sellers are in control. This means that buyers are trying to fight back into the sell trend, and based on how tall that green bar is relative to the most recent red (the gray bars on top of the zero line) it could be an indication of a trend reversal, or it could be a pullback in the current trend.
Haha can you imagine having a few hundred million to throw at some garbage like an NFT. Blows my mind
For me it's specifically helped my timing of entries and exits. I don't have any numbers on how much exactly it has benefit me, but my win rate went up and I feel much more confident making trades with this indicator as confirmation. I wanted to get this tool out to help others first, so I haven't actually done any real recorded testing of this tool in isolation, (which is a bit irresponsible), but I have diligently backtested it for my own strategy and found it to be a great tool to time entries and avoid fake outs.
I think you have to sign up to add indicators to your favorites, but it is free.
I would agree with you if there weren't people alive with unfathomable amounts of money (billionaires), while thousands of others in their same nation are starving or homeless.

Money is inherently selfish. It's a necessity for survival, and so we have a very emotional bond with it. It feels satisfying to earn more of it and frustrating when it's spent on something that doesn't directly benefit you or something you care for. 

If you haven't felt it yourself--like when a friend/family member asks for money or when ignoring a beggar on the street corner--you either live a very privileged life or live in denial. 

No I do not hate money, but it is not a flawless system and to pretend so is irresponsible.
Glad to hear it! A Thinkscript version is on my list of things to do, but it will be a minute... as with the YouTube video--First time animating so it's slow going lol but I will see it through I promise
It takes into account price action, volume, and volatility, and then compares the current bar to the maximum over N days ago. This gives us a relative view into each bars ""actual strength"" so to speak.

The green bars mean the bulls won the bar.
The red bars mean the bears won.

The line is a smoothed average, which gives insight into whether the buyers are in control or the sellers.

The color of the line is determined by its momentum, so green is bullish and red is bearish.
Hmm that's really strange, but I've had one other report of it showing up blurry as well. Have you tried messing with any of the settings?
You will have to backtest it to see it how it fits into your strategy. I use it for confirmation on entries. Strong green bars typically mean strong buy volume and strong red bars typically mean strong sell volume. The signal line shows whether buyers are in control or sellers; the color of the line shows the current momentum of the signal line (red is sellers gaining strength, green is buyers gaining strength).
Is open insider a website?
Can you ELI5 this?
I'm sure playing around with the *Number of Days Back* (N) would let you go as far as 365 days or longer depending on the time frame, as I believe it maxes out around 1000 bars back. I haven't tested it myself as the highest time frame I use is the daily, and I normally use <=14 as my N.
Nah 200 racks or no deal
How do I make sure you pay your half tho? Haha
Click the link I provided and then click the blue ""Add to favorites"" button. I just added an update that makes it much easier to use for new traders, but as to the tweaks... well you will just have to put in some work and figure that out. It's gonna be different for each strategy
I trade stocks, crypto, and forex and it has been working well for me on all. 

Could probably use it as the main entry signal but I've only used it as confirmation for my current entry and exit strategies.
Have you released the vid yet ?
What’s your channel?
I added it to my “favorite” indicators. Then when you go to charts it shows up as an indicator you can add in.
Have you posted the vid yet?
oh I see tradingView is not yours? my mistake
Sounds perfect for me. Please update back here once you get that going!
Does it work with the TV app, or only the site?
Don’t be sorry, I’m just excited to start using the tool
For sure.
Interesting! Impressive work. I’ll have to check out your vid when it’s ready.
You should try tracking it statistically speaking and see the loss vs won ratio then base a hypothesis off of the data. It would be interesting to see the results.
The more I give away the more I make (karma)?
Yes ToS is a very popular platform.  I'd be glad to check it out on there.
Didn't realize I missed this. I tried opening a new chart, I unfavored it then re-favorited it and nothing seems to work.

You don't happen to use TOS and if so make a script for TOS people to try?
Thanks a ton friend. Still waiting for your youtube channel. Dont go so high on quality, just it throw it down. Starting is important.
Yes, sorry should have clarified, even if the chart looks sketchy most of the big purchased stocks go up everytime. Fucking rich people must have inside info or just have a sixth sense
That’s easy, just trust a greedy human .. 😂
You have nothing to loose anyway.. 😁
Awesome!!
Thanks for the reply. I’ll keep testing 👍
No video coming any time soon, but I did update the indicator with a simple mode that gives entry signals and makes it much easier to use
I will release another post or update this one with the link, currently working on a tutorial for this indicator, and I will kick off my channel with that video.
Not yet, it is in progress tho; should be ready soon. I had to learn how to use the program as I decided I wanted to animate it (never animated anything before), so it took a bit longer than expected.
u seriously thought TV was his site? yey!
Works on both, but you have to favorite it first on the website
I'm taking a prop firm evaluation right now and my strategy is really basic and based off this indicator; I'm planning on posting the results and doing some basic analysis on the outcomes of my trades. I might even give away my strategy
I actually have a Thinkscript planned for this indicator, but it might be a while before I get to it since I have other projects with higher priority atm.
Sorry been focusing on passing my prop firm evaluation, and then I will be turning my full attention to youtube to help others
>Fucking rich people must have inside info or just have a sixth sense

The game is definitely rigged in their favor. They have connections (insider info) and the amount of volume they trade with actually influences the market. They literally move it up or down by choice, pretty fucking rigged man.
Will you have a tutorial on how to apply/use this with tos? Would love to try this out. It seems like a useful tool to finally be profitable consistently. Thanks.
I mean what the fuck do I know
Sounds good. Best of luck in your projects, its nice your trying to help people.
Okay 🙂
Sorry I have been slacking on the video. I am currently preparing to take a prop firm examination, and for some reason I thought I would have time to do both lol. After I pass the eval I will be making trading education my new focus. That said, I'm sure if you backtest the VSI on a couple instruments you will immediately find how it can compliment good entry points. Best of luck!
Don’t try to change the subject. 

Right now we’re only focused on what you don’t know.
Up there you know he’s monetizing it. Down here not so much.
Good luck on the examination. No rush at all on making the video. The market will always be there. Just happy to have this resource and excited to learn.",Author,Date

It seems like you kept your consistency up the entirety of 2021 while most stopped growing exponentially from March onward when there was a clear volume and momentum shift in the markets. Very impressive work!

2% max risk per trade is so hard to implement consistently and every day, I am sure you have a max loss set by broker as well? 

Can only agree on the mentor part, in one of the most competitive fields in the world having a proper mentor can save you years of your journey. I have said this since day 1 I started commenting on this subreddit. 


Best of luck in 2022!
Many of the same ideas appear in good r/daytrading submissions. I've seen similar threads in other subs but they are always oriented towards that sub's topic. What is amazing in your post is how expertly you've documented all of the details of your strategy and routine, goals, and results, and how they can be applied to any trading activity in any market. This isn't just a year-end chart, it's a submission of intent and achievement that sets the bar for those that follow. 

Looking forward to your continued growth and experience in 2022.
Amazing work and great post. Thank you for sharing this, was able to learn a lot from this post. Keep up the hard work :)
Nice post thanks and congrats
 King shit. I aspire to be this successful in trading
Props for doing this with the added difficulty of TZs buggy and unreliable trading platform.
who was your mentor?
Where did you start learning and what resources really propelled your skills to the next level?
[deleted]
First and foremost, congrats on an absolute banger of a year and I hope your 2022 makes your 2021 look like a pre-meal snack! 

Any insights into what scan parameters you're using to find your trades?  I feel like this is something that is rarely dove into and I've even seen some treat it like it's some sort of secret.  

I feel like it's kind of an undervalued aspect of trading, folks know that scanning is important and we all do it but we're far quicker to give credit to other aspects such as technical analysis but before we put our technician hats on we all usually have our hunting caps on. 

Again, congrats on 2021 and best of luck in the new year!
Really impressive work! 

Becoming a succesful trader is possible but it requires a lot of time and effort. I'm glad to see that you commited yourself and saw amazing results! You really deserved it.
I’ve been engaged in the stock market for around 1.5 years now, started day trading 6 months ago. The learning curve would’ve came exponentially faster with a good mentor. In this business, you literally don’t know what you should learn at the start.
On your Cumulative P&L, it shows around $600k, but Total Gain/Loss shows $236k. Can you explain the difference? Sorry for the dumb question.
I recently started journaling my trades. I write down the reasons why I enter and whether or not it failed, why the trade succeeded or failed, and lessons to be learned. It’s helpful
Amazing work OP, congratulations! Very inspiring
Congrats you beast
Thanks for sharing, very nice to see a trader work hard and obtain success!
Congrats on a very profitable year! Very impressive and your dedication is admirable!
Congrats man, I’ve been following your journey through Twitter and the multiple podcasts you’ve done. Wishing you the best in 2022 and beyond!
Congratulations! Have you thought about mentoring someone? Like me perhaps? Hahah seriously though, would really want to learn from you.
This looks like a post that would be in r/realdaytrading
Good post! Thanks for sharing
Nice, saved for multiple re-reads later. Would be interested to know who the mentor/sorcerer who guided you to those stats ha!
December 17th: $-39,000. What happened that day? Was it emotionally challenging to deal with, especially going into a weekend? I know you were still up for the week, did you lean on that? I'm interested in how successful traders deal with the emotional aspects. That to me is more challenging than the technical aspects of trading.
How does one find a mentor
Wow this is amazing, all the best for your future success. Can you share what books and resources helped you in gaining this knowledge. I would like to ask if you can be my mentor or In case you had a mentor can you share his/her details. Trying to follow your footsteps.
Listen, we've seen this game. Anyone who makes that kind of jack ain't on Reddit telling the world about how they did it.
So from $1800 to $400,000? Impressive, but in my opinion; unlikely.

Looks too good to be true.
Success requires no justification, and failure permits no Alibi. Well done dude.
This is a really great post. Thank you for sharing!
Good job, congrats!

Congrats for your achievement, and thanks a lot for sharing. I was doing okay earlier this year, but I lost more than half of the profit I generated in early this year. Definitely more to learn, keep up the great work!
Wow incredible. I notice you tend to be more scalpy holding for minutes in first hour of trading then intraday will swing for hours and scale out more slowly. 

This is a big mistake I see a lot of day traders make. They scalp the morning successfully then their afternoon scalps fail hard because holding for hours becomes more effective.
Hmm. You're the second person with ridiculous performance to mention this kinfo app that I have never heard of. I'm sure it is possible to enter manual trades if you're a shill for the company as was the other guy. Guys this shit just ain't possible within 1 year of trading. Don't fall for it.
With this kind of performance you will be the richest man on the planet in a couple years 🙄🙄🙄🙄
So you had no day job I’m assuming, with that said… how did you recover psychologically from big red days..? Great job BTW!!
Finally some quality content! Thanks for sharing!
You are amazing! Congratulations on all your hard work paying off! Keep it up! You’re giving us something to aspire for.

Great advice.
Do you have a systematized way you take your exits after triggering into a trade?

Do you sell 1/4 or 1/5th at 1R, 2R, 3R etc?

How are some ways in which you let your winners ride?

How do you handle the emotional trauma of letting winners ride, and then once it taps 1 or 2R targets, it reverses and stops you out? Turning a green trade red is never fun.

Give us some ways in which you take your exits.
[deleted]
I see you took an options trade in December 21. I started trading options like I trade stocks. I don’t trade spreads, just buy single puts and calls. I like doing this for going short because I don’t have to borrow any stock. 

I can certainly learn from you though and thanks for the post.
Great post and congratulations on your success!

So the way this works is that it reads your brokers trade logs, and are 100% accurate to the trade logs it exports.

The trick OP isn't telling you is that paper trades export trade logs exactly like regular trades. Some brokers probably let you edit your paper trades after the fact too.

I'd take OP with a massive grain of salt on this.
OP is my idol
This Is literally my dream.. I have 2 little boys I miss everyday spending anywhere from 12-16 hours at work to provide for them.  I was trying to do day trading while at work on my phone,  but it was hard to keep up in and out trades were hard, but the first 6 trades (pdt) I  was probably up almost 200%  then missed inputs,  bought a put when I meant to buy a call and didn't catch it until profits were down 50%  then I just kept missing the right trades,  hesitating because I only had 3 trades for the week and crashed the account.  

I've searched for mentors but they always say join this discord or check this group,  I want to sit live with someone and have feed back and discuss live action on the charts.  I struggle with keeping my adhd in check sometimes and can't  actively keep information flowing because I lack the structure/layout plan.  

Honestly anyone willing to help,  pm me,   I know this is something I can do and absolutely crush if I had a mentor guide me to good habits in the beginning.
Nice job.  Are you on Twitter as well?  Some really smart mentors over there
Can you post this in r/realdaytrading?
TLDR: I do whatever
I see on your last trades that youv'e done 0.5% and ""small"" gains - as a small account traded - how you managed to grow your account at smaller gains? like doing 0.5% on 3K account is pretty much nothing no?   


Anyway, amazing job, really.
Great write-up, great inspiration. Sorry if this info is in there somewhere, but how much did you begin with?
How does one find a mentor? I’ve never met anyone who trades consistently.
And your a Garen main! It all makes sense. Congrats though. Is this your full time job or do you work another job as well?
[deleted]
which trading community did you join?
Nice. Silly question. Do you use only 2% of your currently equity on each trade or do you use the majority of your equity in a trade and then set the stop at losses of 2% ?!
Great work! Thank you for sharing! I’d like to get serious about Day Trading in 2022. So far, doing mostly scalps and high volubility stocks. AMC, GME, Nakd, BB etc. Markets have a lot of potential but they are rigged so be careful everybody! Happy New Year - 2022.
Post plays next time
Very interesting. Have you heard of Ray Barros’s approach to risk? 

Instead of having a max 2% risk, he defines his psychological state as either a flow state or ebb state. During flow state he’s trading extremely well, will let runners run and will up to 2.5x his size. When he’s in ebb state he’s dropping his size and taking profits at 1R. As he’s a longer term position or swing trader, he often spends weeks in each state. 

I wonder whether you’d have better results doing this over a period instead of changing size throughout the day.
Op posted a similar post a few weeks ago. With different figures. It's all bs.
Congratz trading in a bull market.
Nice post, very organized and thoughtful. Personally I’m not that impressed with the 400k,  I’ve made more than that on a single trade before. Of course i risked way more than 2%. Which is lame AF. And I started off w 5k. And let me tell you a dirty little secret—it’s mostly to do with the market not the trader. Don’t delude yourself into thinking you are on your way to figuring it out. It’s always situational.
Awesome! Thank you very much for sharing. This is light at the end of the tunnel
Awesome post thank you
Very impressive!
I see mixed reviews about level 2 and how it's used. If tomorrow brokers no longer have access to level 2 do you think it would have a meaningful impact on your profit?

Thanks for sharing your journey. Illuminating and helpful. And congrats on your success.
This was an excellent write up and I’m saving it to review again later tn. Might comment again with a question or two haha, thanks and congrats op
First of congratulations 

Secondly what is your risk management plan, it sounds like you went ultra aggressive lol

Thirdly keep on smashing it !
Great year and many congratulations on all the gains you have accumulated last year .. were your strategies long vs short coz many use TradeZero to short stocks

Since you started with small capital.. were majority or trades trading options vs equity ? 

Thanks and all the best for 2022
A month of paper trading is nothing, you went live after that? Were you killing it paper trading? Nice post, it all makes sense and is everything I know to do, the actual *doing it* is the hard part.
Congratulations on your success.  This is amazing and very inspiring!

Can you explain what happened in September and November to hurt your performance?

Thanks !
That’s so interesting that the beginning of the year was a bit of a slow burn in relation to your insane end of year performance. That’s about the opposite of everyone else I’ve seen this year. Really good stuff though, extremely impressive. Congratulations!
What filters you use for scanner on tradingview?
I’m curious how you started with $1800 and ended up with $400k. As you used a risk of 2% per trade, what was your monthly profit in %?
Do you use a pre-market scanner? Also what trading platform do you use to get the best order fill
Are CFDs just a different way of trading stocks?
Great job OP! Can you or anyone recommend any discord channels I could join? Been looking for this for a while but haven’t found any. Also what twitter accounts do you recommend?
And this is why the pattern day trade law is fucking me over. You can't do this with that law in place. Sigh... 18k to go..
On which platform do you use to enter trades? Tradingview?
Thanks for the post and congratulations!

Were you working a regular job before getting into trading? If yes, how did you transition over? I’m assuming you’re living off your trading income now if you’re trading 9:30 - 4:00? Or do you work night shifts or similar?
How much of your gains were trading options vs stock?
Something changed in your trading style in 26-05-2021 or are the effect of scaling up?

Congratulations, massive returns.
Wow awesome job! Looking forward to seeing what 2022 brings for you. Do you trade straight shares or options?
How important is your scanner to your success? Still on the fence about signing up for Trade-Ideas (i already have tradingview premium)
How have you found your accuracy change as you’ve switched from small cap momentum stocks to larger cap stocks?
[deleted]
Did you take a course beforehand?
How do I make a calendar like that??
I hope to see you in the next market wizards book. Congrats
You mentioned trading crypto stocks, have you traded crypto directly yet? It seems your trading style could fit trading crypto as well
OP, I like the way that it seems like you track and record everything that you do as far as all the daily trades you make, and what companies etc.

This is something that I would like to start getting better at.  Does anyone have any recommendations on possible programs to use to do this? I am decent at Excell and would assume that that would be a good place to enter all your data into.

I just didn't know if there was a better program to use or maybe what OP uses to input, track, and record all his trades and data.

Thanks
Are there any particular setups that you like the most, or find yourself most profitable on? What timeframe do you take the majority if your trades on? 

If you wouldn't mind, I would really love to see a couple of your trades. Doesn't need to be in depth analysis, but it would be very interesting. 

It doesn't look like you post about your trading very often, would it be worth it to give you a follow? Do you think that'll change in the future?
I am growing a small account in the same way. Thanks for the inspiration. 
2% of $1500 gives you $30 of risk per trade. What was your max day stop out or max day loser in this case? 3-4 full stops?
While the write up is nice, what is your strategy exactly? Can you please break down your entry/exit criteria?
yo buddy,

firstly, HELLO from london. im based in archway been here for 5 years from manchester originally.

got 3 questions if you have a spare minute.

1) do you care about commissions? im with ibkr, im scalping and the commissions are really hitting me hard sometimes.

2) do you buy on the bid and sell on the ask? (adding liquidity basically).

3) TAXES! are you doing this all on self assessment self employed? or are you setting up a ltd company and paying yourself via dividends? do you use an accountant? im looking at just doing my own self assessment while keeping the trading logs.

&#x200B;

thanks bud,
Canadian?
Did you use leverage ?
Bruh you killed it congrats.  I started daytrading in 2021 after dabbling in it, then losing my job and now I'm all in, but no where near your profitability.  I rarely use options though.  Usually only when I want to short something my broker won't let me borrow to go short on.  Usually I'm scalping, in and out in seconds.
Hey OP can I see the most popular of the  tickers you were trading? Or like the most commonly traded tickers?  I always choose terrible stocks. Thanks!
[deleted]
Dude! Recognized the name. LST room moderator. Didn't get much value from there, last day tomorrow. Somehow can't really picture the flags Jeff talks about. Was Jeff your main mentor or did you have others?
Op that's incredible and I am interested in your thoughts between a monster August and a near flatline September.  What is that like? What emotions do you contend with and thoughts on the situation?
the fustrating thing for me is needing a large equity pool to begin with so that I can short. I can only long stocks unless I have 10K or so more in my IBKR. sigh.

Great read though, grats.
How much was an average trade in December? What was the average percentage P/L per trade by then? Thanks for being so open. I would love to be able to do this, this year.
Hey dude, pretty compelling stuff.  2 questions for you.  

It looked like your average hold times were about 2 hours for your trades.  Do you ever hold positions over night?

I understand a lot of the work is just identifying the stock and the entry, but I was curious about what you do to exit your trades.  Do you rely on stop losses that you set when you open your position?Do you modify it as the stock moves?  Do you just exit manually?
Excellent, 
0.46% game of ever trade
$72 bucks. On average 50k capital used to make 70 bucks.  

Those are some fast trades !!!
Nice post
Ah, very cool to see you on here. I'd actually like to ask questions as well!

I know you mentioned this before, but how many ""full risk"" trades do you take per day, vs. trades that are not full risk? Do you have any methods you use to mentally check yourself from overtrading, as well as techniques you use to prevent yourself from taking full risk on trades that should not warrant full risk? This has been my issue for a few months now and I'm having a hard time cracking it.

Also, I know you spend a ton of time in front of the screens during market hours. I personally have a difficult time doing this...ranging from physical reasons (headache, etc.) to mental reasons (fatigue, lack of focus). Is this an issue for you, and if so, do you do anything on a daily basis to mitigate it (meditation, running maybe)? 

Thanks man, looking forward to seeing your progress this new year.
One day I hope to understand just 5% of this and also learn how to daytrade/invest...

Good job man this is really amazing!!
can you share your tradingview screener parameters?
[deleted]
Thanks for sharing 👍
Massive massive respect! Congratulations! 🎉
This was accomplished with stocks? No options?
Insane respect
Interested on how do you actually use tradingview+tradezero together, as this is what I use too and find it difficult to chart on one while trading on the other, while sometimes staying in position for only a few minutes.

How do you actually have it setup?

Thanks for the post
Extremely impressive man!   
I'm finding this particularly inspiring. I'm mostly a mid-term swing trader with a bunch in long term, and I've given myself the challenge of turning $500 into $50k in 6-12 months, so I'm feeling really validated in seeing your growth and that I'm looking at strategies much like what you've used.
[deleted]
Great job!, did you work a “normal” job besides this?
1. What's your profit target in percentage per trade? or per day?

2.  How much capital do you go into per trade when trading momentum low caps? what about for the larger caps?

3. You execute a high number of trades per day, I'm guessing most of those are the result of getting stopped out? Especially considering your total number of losing trades is greater than your total winning trades
How do you enter/exit position? 

I've seen from you TW charts that it seems you scale in/out gradually. 

Any rule of thumb there?
wow thanks for sharing, so cool ! I was wondering if you could tell us what resources to use to teach yourself the strategies that you currently use? Did you only use a mentor? I would like to get into day trading as a hobby (and potentially transition to full-time) but am not sure where to start. Thanks heaps.
please don't forget to do another for 2022 and it would be awesome if you share what you gonna do this year too
Hi, this is absolutely incredible. I havent started proper trading myself, but I've been buying and following stocks for a year now.

What direction would you point someone looking to get into day trading, in terms of learning resources?
First off, great work and thanks so much for sharing!

I have a goal of becoming profitable in the next 6-12 months.  I'm probably profitable right now on my day trades but my swings are longer term and sitting red currently. I also didn't have a proper stop in place on one of my big swing positions and am bag holding like a noob.

A quick question for you - Are there any good communities for people who do very short term day trades / scalping?

One other question - Do you have different rules/strategy for the midcaps and higher?  I feel like higher priced stocks just don't respect the technicals enough for me to feel confident in them and would probably never use my day trade rules against anything over maybe $20.
I love seeing individual success stories.  Gets me fired up u/Valckrie!!!  GREAT JOB.....

I think you should post your trades on an open forum so we can help others be successful.  All ships rise with the tide when we follow technical analysis.

My Trading Checklist, All Bullish or Bearish:

1. Type of candle- Bullish/Bearish Engulfing, Hammer, Doji
2. Volume- Up or Down as compared to trend
3. 20-Day SMA Divergence- Is there a wide divergence above or below?
4. Gaps- Are there gaps above or below the market?  GAPS FILL 80% OF THE TIME
5. Stochastics- Overbought/Oversold- Buy or sell signal?
6. CCI- Overbought/Oversold- Buy or sell signal?
7. Is the CCI crossing above or below the momentum line?- Weigh the evidence to determine who is controlling the price of the stock. The- Buyers or the Sellers?

**If the trade meets all 7 criteria (Bullish or Bearish) CHOOSE YOUR TIME HORIZON AND MAKE THE TRADE!**

GOOD LUCK IN 2022 APES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As you have stated, you increase your risk as your account grew. Did you have a plan or rules for scaling up? Congrats bro, truly amazing!
[deleted]
What broker did u use?
Awesome job, Valckrie! 

I have one question: do you have (or suggest) any rule/habit for withdrawing what you've earned? I think it's somewhat crucial to practice your mind to actually see (and spend some) the money in your bank account, so you can get that tangibility of the whole trading career.

Is there a percentage you withdraw from every month's winnings or only once a year or..?
[deleted]
Hi OP, this is kind of an older post so I don't know if you will see this comment. But your growth is absolutely astounding and I wish you all the best in the markets!

Alas, I am limited by my time zone and lifestyle, only able to trade the first 1h30m of RTH. Do you think it is still viable for me to day trade or would you recommend swing-trading?
Just followed you on Twitter. Look forward to seeing your daily charts.
Did you face any nerves once you sized up to relatively large risk per trade? How did you handle this?
[deleted]
Nice post. 

I am still new, mostly in the research stage but at the point where I want to start practicing with papertrading. I appreciate your post and all the helpful tips. I came here after searching one of the recommended papertrading apps. 

Your post has a lot of great info. I have a full time job and it pays well, but i havent enjoyed it for the last few years and i miss a lot of time with my family. I am hoping to learn and get into day and swing trading, with some investing for longer term, and eventually be able to leave my job and that hostility behind. 

Thank you again for your post. Hopefully i can get to a point in papertrading where I am constantly green so I can make the switch. 

If you dont mind me asking (since ive accidentally deleted this comment several times while searching for the proper terms in your post…), do you do trading mostly on your PC? I only ask because the image banner (on reddit mobile) shows a mobile phone app. I dont know if papertrading is even a thing on mobile, but i think id probably try to use my laptop. Anyways, I see you use trading view, which i understand is recommended for paper trading, but i havent heard of tradeZero. You list it as your broker. Is it part of trading view or different?

And lastly, you listed several journals. How do you figure and deal with tax info? Its funny, most things ive read talk a lot about how to trade, but not about taxes and how to manage that aspect of trading. 

Sorry for the silly questions. I saved your post and will add it to my binder of info ive put together to help me out (hope thats okay). Thanks again for your post!
any discord channel?
How did you manage to watch the markets all day while having another income? I work full time and find it nearly impossible to pay attention to intra-day price action since I am so busy
What  stocks prices you were trading in the beginning of your journey?
\> I primarily traded sub $10 stocks. Now I have moved onto midcaps and higher priced stocks since I don't want to pay as much short locate fees.

u/valckrie  I'm a bit late to the party, I also use Tradezero and have a similar trading style to yours, what's your criteria for shorting lowcap top gainers? I want to short them but the only thing that makes me hesitant is the locate fees, if the stock shoots up you get stopped out and have just lost what you paid for the locate, so how do you make sure it won't shoot up, what's your strategy for shorting small caps?
>1% on okay setups, 2% risk on great setups,

So do you calculate where your stop is based on a support level?  Sometimes those can be like 10% below an entry point? 

Or do you have your entry point and say ""ok 4% drop from here max""?

Having problems setting stops from my entry.  I tend to set them too early, but setting a stop at like 15% below entry (at a key support level) just seems so big?
This is one of the most inspirational posts I've ever come across.

It's especially so because you sell nothing and seek nothing in return.

Thanks so much for sharing your journey.

May I ask - why did you choose to go with tradevue as opposed to tradersync?

(I am asking because I am looking for a good journaling and trade analytical tool for myself and these 2 seem the best options)
someone has diamond hands💎
When do you buy the grappers? Premarket ?
Hello mate, how's 2022 going so far?
Hey, my question is just about how the numbers work in practice. If you have 20+ trades in a day and each trade involves a total amount of money of at least 5% of your account (assuming at least that much since your risk is 2% of your account), then wouldn’t your account money turn over too much and you run into settlement violations? 

Thanks.
Thanks for sharing this, and well done. I can only imagine the mentality and mindset required to push on with this. 

I’m new and have been worried about not having huge capital to play with to begin. So thanks for showing what’s possible.
I’ve sent through a message on here and through twitter DMs, please do have a look. I look forward to it :)
Does 2% max risk mean you put stop loss at trade amount - 2%? Or you go in trade with only 2% from all your capital? 
Do you trade with cash or margin account? 
What Level 2 data provider do you use?
Sorry for a lot of questions. I appreciate your clarifications )
I wish I could find a mentor, especially now. A trader's path is lonely, with many of its roads leading nowhere
Hey brother I’m currently on my 2nd month journey of studying my strategy and practicing with it. I want to start going live now with $1000 but would like to talk to someone about this while on my journey, is it okay if I pm you?
Thanks. I do have a broker max loss but even I suffer from discipline issues and have taken outsized losses from adjusting it in the middle of the trading day :)
I assumed they meant their stop is set for a 2% max loss relative to their account balance. Though clearly they also said they will push to 3% for the right set up... I get the sense that OP is toeing the line between trading on emotion and instinct based on experience, which is something that I think most of us struggle with. It's difficult to compartmentalize and be consistent, for me anyway.

anyways -

I.e. OP wakes up with a balance of $100k. OP wants to buy 5000 shares of ABC @ $10 for a total $50k. OP has spent 50% of his trading balance, but only wants to risk 2%. Though he might set a stop at \~$9.60. If he loses the trade, he'll lose $.40 a share, or $2k. $2k = 2% of his $100k balance. If OP messes up with the stop or doesn't close out before the bell, they stand to lose more than the 2% max the strategy calls for.
The #marketrebellion has great coaches and can mentor you if you chose to have individual coaching sessions.  Individual coaching sessions are worth every penny.  I have learned a lot and am building my wealth.
appreciate the kind words!

it's a real shame that I can't use Centerpoint or Cobra like US traders can
Tradezero is so goddamn fucking awful, it is incredible they have a clienture.

So SO fucking often it has connection and charting issues and straight up does not execute or double executes etc. 

Not to mention their UI and order entries and option management is like 10 years behind

Kids please, stay the fuck away from TZ. I wish I had, I have by now swapped to DAS.
edit: to clarify my point, I suggested to find a mentor or community that matches the style you wish to trade, as everyone is different. As with everything you should do your own research and review before making any decisions - since not all rooms are teaching proper trading. Also learning from a mentor doesn't automatically guarantee success, it's still down to the individual; in the end statistics hold true and only 10% or less will make it. I did not intend this post to promote any service or chatroom, and I do not run any services myself.
I traded in the same group that OP traded in and funny thing is the owner of that group has posted in this sub but his posts only got like 3 upvotes and no comments lol
Honestly, these were my thoughts also. Anyone that can do a write up like this can also succeed in their goals.
My scan is pretty simple. If you are an active trader then you have watchlists from prior days/weeks of stocks that have been making big moves. Then you have new gappers on the day which is just high premarket % change or volume leaders on the day doing extreme volume. Momentum traders may also use TradeIdeas which is good at detecting new high of day price levels on stocks
I'm 6 months behind you and I've said this time and again. Every time I learn a bit, I find out there is a whole bunch more of just that one subject.
Where would you recommend to find a mentor?
3rd picture was for December only
Going through different reading groups trying to learn.  Been at it for a couple of years but I feel so behind like I’m not sure what I need to learn and how to grow consistency. I like your advice I’m going to try that.
thanks but i've only done one, unless you are thinking of the wrong person
have no plans currently but you never know in the future
+1
+1
Didn't take my stoploss and lost 5x what I planned to on the trade. All losses are tough, but I knew where I should've stopped out. Discipline failure
even if you showed 100 people your edge 90 people would probably fail to execute the plan in action. and I have no intention of telling the world my exact strategy either
I am so amazed at a couple of you guys reacting like this. I probably thought the same way a couple years ago, but I think you guys see too many ""YOLO"" style traders and think 6figs is only feasible like that..  Matter of fact, most seasoned traders do not find 6 figures ''enough'' in terms of the opportunities provided in the market. 

Stop looking at the percentages, and get his starting account size out of your head. That's what makes it seem impossible to you. 

A US trader starting off with 27k and trying to stay over PDT with/without leverage, is essentially in the same situation as him as he has BP, but little room for failure. It sounds more likely for them to succeed because of the account size, but it isn't. 

With leverage, everything is possible. Once you hit 2500 with TZ, you get 6x leverage.  With a small account, if you want to grow quick in the beginning its boom or bust. So yes, if you refund your account each time you go bust, and come back with new tools in your arsenal, eventually you will place yourself in a goldilocks situation where you will boom.

The first quarter of 2021 was amazing in small caps. In Jan 21, he was mostly green, 100-400 dollar days. Then he got a great opp. Jan 28, making 7.1k. Remember he has 6x leverage. So he has plenty of BP now and can trade comfortably. He kept his losing days under control for those next few months, and that's it (his losing days in the last Q are a bit outsized but that's another topic). 

Another point is the psyche of someone trading a small account. Having constantly been in survival mode, often having seen your account down 50% in the beginning etc., it's likely you'll barely flinch once your account starts getting much farther away from 0.

I have been trading since Dec 2015, back then there were brokers who gave out insane leverage, like 10x on a $500 account minimum. There have been thousands like OP. Many of these traders come and go, or come and go on to do amazing things. Most of the ones that go on to do amazing things drop off from the face of the earth, only trading within their small circle. Some become gurus and start services - be wary of these, there are few that are legit, 95-99% of traders fail.

And I do have to add - 1.5 years is NOT the norm. Most traders haven't been through enough market cycles in such a short time. Year 2-3 of full market time and excruciating pain is more feasible. Perhaps in the future I'll start a blog telling my story, having survived the trading gulag.

There have been thousands like him, please open your mind to what is possible. It is NOT easy, AT ALL (this isn't stressed often)  and many don't actually keep the profits. Still, no matter your account size, if you keep risk management first, you'll grow it in the right conditions.  The key is to have resolved all of your trading issues, so once you do grow, you will actually keep it.
I think that's why they put up the kinfo link. If I understand correctly it's one of the best ways to show what they're showing.
Eh i know quite a few people who’ve done similar amounts.
edit: to clarify my point, I suggested to find a mentor or community that matches the style you wish to trade, as everyone is different.

If you adopt a long term approach to trading then every bad trade or loss is a learning opportunity for you to avoid the same mistake in the future. Hopefully your present loss will be a fraction of your future negated losses.
that's a good obversation and I 100% agree. open is definitely more erratic and you can sit in trends for longer as the day goes on
Well, kinfo is a free app. I'm not selling anything. People will doubt for sure, as statistically this is the performance of a top 1% trader in a <2 year timeframe. Who knows, maybe I'll fail in 5 years?
this kind of growth is only possible with a small account. the larger the account the harder it becomes eventually
I did but went full time later. Big red days are usually from a failure of discipline and not respecting risk and stoplosses. I get confidence looking back at my long term performance and knowing that I have edge in the market. Setbacks are hard but everyone endures them, and like a pullback in an uptrending chart, the pullback itself doesn't matter, it's what happens after and if you can recover and keep going.
as mentioned in post I don't have a rigid exit system

some general ideas

* take partials into likely support/resistance zones
* take off some after 2R
* clear trend reversals or rejections
1) i don't trade pre-market or afterhours unless there is tonnes of volume, but for scanning its just premkt % change up 5 or 10%+ either direction, anything over $3 is my preference

2) i'm sure all those books are probably good, but I haven't read many myself so can't give any recommendations
""The integration with brokers only supports real accounts, it´s not possible to link paper trading or other types of non-real accounts.""
He's also full of bs. He posted a similar post that got to the top a few weeks ago with different figures.
yeah, there are many elite traders on twitter
look up compounding interest - if you made 2% every single day on a 3k account and reinvested profits after 252 days you would have 400k
$1,800
didn't take my stop and took a 5x loss

made a costly mistake, i'm not a perfect trader

if every trader took their stops 100% of the time we'd all be successful
He is lying. He posted a few weeks ago another post just like this but different.
2% risk means the maximum capital lost. The position size and exposure is usually much more than 2%. Most brokers offer margin
heard of this somewhere but personally I will stick to my rules :)
Yeah so you made that much profit this bull market too then?

No? Oh STFU then
Significantly overperforming the bull market is the key here...
Somebody sounds jealous lolol
Tons of people blew up their account in this market.  Just because it's a bull market doesn't mean profits are guaranteed. Staying profitable is good, beating the market by this many multiples is absolutely a success no matter how you may want to downplay it.

He plays both sides he can make money as long as there is liquidity.
Longer timeframe swing traders enter based off daily candles and don't even look at L2. L2 is more important for scalping or shorter term strategies imo, so if there was no level 2, I would just switch to longer timeframe
Just needed time in markets and slowly progress and learn until one day it starts to click. Small gains everyday in knowledge and experience eventually also compound into proficiency and skill
2% of equity most of the time. sometimes lack of discipline led to bigger losses
It's in the post
both long and short and it was all equity until recently where I experimented with options
my paper trading was on TradingView which was useless in hindsight since wasn't reflective of execution, and obviously lacked emotion
Yeah, that's crazy.
September just had a lack of discipline and took multiple average losses just effectively wiping out any gains made during the period.

In November I took an oversized loss overnight long a position the day before thanksgiving. Then omicron news came out next day and I sold out on the gap down for a big loss.

I also took a big loss not respecting my stoploss later in December.
The market was far hotter in the beginning of the year but my account was tiny and I wasn't as good a trader back then.

Trade e mini and micro futures. No PDT rule exists. Requires less capitol. And it’s more tax efficient too.

if you are into momentum setups then TradeIdeas can be useful I think. if you are the type to wait for trends to develop then you don't need to spot those tickers immediately. you can find them 30 minutes later and still trade it
To be fair, any successful day trader is an outlier since mass majority are not profitable
I've been day trading for 7 years. You need to learn price action. Most courses end up being scams or just not detailed enough to teach you to be profitable to perform. Check out price action here. It's pretty much all free.

it's from Tradervue
Most of the market wizards are billionaires and this guy make 400k and you guys all act like it's the most sus thing you've ever seen. Salty ass sub. Congrats OP! Please don't let all the ""Random Walkers"" that don't believe you can beat the S & P 500 bring you down.
not myself but I heard that technical analysis works very well on Crypto
tradervue, tradersync, edgewonk, kinfo to list a few apps
breakouts and breakdowns from tight ranges, moves in one direction where the other has failed, reversals after a long sustained trend

timeframe: 15m is most consistent i find

i have a bunch of chart screenshots on my twitter
1. yes, which is why I'm trying to avoid low priced stocks when shorting - the borrow fees add up. Sub 3$ is basically total avoid for me nowadays
2. for entries since I mostly trade breakouts/breakdowns I take liquidity. once i'm in a trade and exiting partials its adding liquidity
3. i started off self assessment but now have a LTD company. i do use an accountant
think he's from UK
you only get free commissions when you add liquidity, but still pay fees on removing liquidity

yes, i use margin. not heard of GFV - google seems like its a cash account thing?

TradeZero international has no PDT rule so is good for small accounts. I'm pretty sure it has more locates than IBKR too. Tastyworks is for options afaik
no more mentors but i learnt from the tonnes of free info out there. lots of traders put out quality content on twitter, as well as prop firms on youtube etc
>LST room moderator.

what's LST room?
replied elsewhere:

""Big red days are usually from a failure of discipline and not respecting risk and stoplosses. I get confidence looking back at my long term performance and knowing that I have edge in the market. Setbacks are hard but everyone endures them, and like a pullback in an uptrending chart, the pullback itself doesn't matter, it's what happens after and if you can recover and keep going.""
it's in the December stats picture
note average holding time stats are not accurate for daytrades due to some overnight/swing trades affecting the average

a more accurate number is around 30 mins to 1 hour

i usually put in range orders once in a trade but i will modify exit plans if i see a clear reversal happening
I am actually pretty risk averse and most days don't end up taking the full risk I should be taking in some trades. Lately even more so as my account grows I've been leaning more to 1% on alot of trades. Before every trade I enter my entry and stop and calculate share size and should prevent any oversized risk trades. I don't recall any specific techniques other than after trading the same setup or seeing the same patterns so often, you kind of know when you're too early and it isn't quite perfect yet.

I haven't had any issues since I use to work in front of the screens before. The standard advice is probably good, to just take frequent small breaks
out of 1000 people reading this 100 might become profitable traders. out of that 100, 10 might become extremely profitable. out of those 10, a few could match or outperform these returns
Hahaha well Reddit is for losers and I’m only here to see what the apes do, but I’m near these returns, so definitely possible, however most people will fail.
with multiple monitors you could have them both open. or you could float the TZ order windows next to your chart.
i'm not quite sure where is actually one great place to start since there are so many great free resources out there. a good intro book is ""How to daytrade for a living by Andrew Aziz"", afterwards you will have some idea of topics to google and research further
if you google ""daytrading chatroom reviews"" there are a few review sites which write their opinion on some rooms.

the concepts by which I trade mid large caps are still the same, but more often you need to look at larger timeframes on them for it to make sense
used a 2% risk adjusted often to achieve compounding effect
when you short sell you have to buy to cover your short. if you look at the chart that day it started downtrending from noon. i started shorting and covered (buy) to take profit on the way down. i also added some back short later on.

that's not too uncommon to have many small losses when trade isn't working but when it does you win larger
have no particular rule at the moment
the intraday scanner is very simple just % change on day or volume. benzinga pro squawk also helps with breaking news. other than that I  just watch alot of sidecharts (16 in total) of stuff I been trading the last few days
Also, if it's possible and you're willing to do so, could you share your cumulative P&L in the log-scale? That will better show the growth rate and trading consistency over youe journey.
sometimes, but if you think about bet size as 2% of equity it's not a huge deal statistically
I take >3% risk and usually it’s once or twice a year where I land on massive loss. It works for most of the times. However, it could drag a while for it to come into +ve or going down below 3%
Yes I trade always on the PC, you need a PC setup if you are going to take it seriously IMO. 

TradeZero is a broker and has its own platform. Completely unrelated to TradingView

Tax depends on your country and I'd advise contacting accountants 
 to provide you expertise in that area
You can use replay to watch after work, but mostly you don’t need to trade all day
I don't trade many smallcaps these days. I don't have a specific criteria for them but if I wanted to short I would look for a clean chart pattern. You can find lots of twitter traders who focus purely on lowfloat gappers with their stats and criteria but it's not my style
sounds like your entry spots are too wide then. i dont think about % its always a dollar risk per share. e.g. you enter at $17.50 risking a higher low at $17.25. thats 25c risk

stop is always at price point in the chart. never an arbitrary percentage
thanks. when I started I didn't know about tradersync and now it'd be a pain to migrate data over to new apps, and tradervue is good enough
most daytraders use margin accounts...
therein lay the problem. how many times have i changed that ..for better or worse we all do it
How where you able to trade 22 times a day with a budget of $1800 ? That would mean if you risked 2% like you said you played with $36 a day but that would also mean you had to have made over 100% gain in all 22 trades to even touch 1500 a day. I might be legit retarded but thats not making sense to me.


Edit: it says you made $15k in a day not $1500 i missed a number. Which makes this totally unbelievable. Unless i missed something because obviously i dint read the whole thing. Lol
>Now I have moved onto midcaps 

Hi, did you even start using Fibonacci levels ?
I see you used to play poker. Do you still play? What are your results there? Congrats on the great year!
I need a journaling app will check out tradervue unless there's a better suggestion?
What app does he want people to download exactly? He listed a ton, but didn’t specifically mention to download anything.  Unless I missed it somewhere in his post.
CMEG is another offshore option that offer DAS and/or sterling platforms.
Are you Canadian?
Why did you choose TZ versus IBKR for instance (sorry if this is a dumb question, still learning here)
IB/DAS mate.
Sign up on the waiting list of centerpoint. You should be able to use Clear street clearing house with CP this year. Been with them 4 years now but recently banned us in December
100% - I learnt the hard way.
>DAS

Is DAS available for Non-US based residents? Since OP is from the UK.
How did you go about finding a community or mentor? I hear it often to go out and find someone, but I keep coming across groups where they just do trade signals or just copy cat trading without any real discussion.
Would love to know as well as I embark on this journey. Thank you. 

(Ps. Do you offer any mentorship?)
Can you DM me too?
Dm pls
DM please. Cheers.
dm thanks
Dm me as well please.
Dm please and thank you!
Dm pls!!
I have thesame trading style as you, I'm having difficulty getting a premarket scanner for large/mid caps. Which ones do you use? I currently use webull and tradingview scanners which are very good...but only for the lowcaps.

I'm thinking I have to go with a  paid scanner, which would you recommend, finviz or tradeideas?
Oh geez, I now see the label. Sorry
Oh yeah, just Chat W/ Traders :)
I also believe you have a talent for teaching. Go down that Avenue because you have become a virtuoso in trading.
Looking forward to it. The profit you've made will let me retire early so I'm eager to get better at trading / investing. Cheers mate
Your ""exactly strategy""? Yeah, you're probably better off keeping that one to yourself.
just saw this, agree with everything you said
Still unlikely. The way I see these this is - it might be a great example of survivorship bias.

Assuming it's not, OP's going to make a killing in the next few years, which is just awesome! We'll wait and see, hope they will post a follow up in a year :)
Can you DM me your trading community as well?
Could you also DM me please? Thanks a lot!
You posted a similar post here last month with different figures 😂
Not true whatsoever lol u should be risking the same percentage on each trade regardless the account size to remain sustainable over the long haul. Good luck 👍🏾
As someone going full time soon. At what point did you decide to go full time?
so you dont use hard stops? no stop market orders? just mental?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thanks

Interactive Brokers paper account sure doesn't seem like it has a problem linking with it.
Who do you follow on twitter that would be worth following?
Surely even the best traders don’t make 2% a day. Maybe 2% a month. Not that I’m accusing you of lying but I find that very hard to believe you are the next Warren Buffett.
Not questioning your stats, I buy it. But are you making 2% of your account value, or 2%  of the 2% your risking? Although I guess you said your looking for a 1:2 RR... So nvm I think i answered my question.

Nice work! Definitely had some good takeaways from your write up.
Even more impressive. Gives me some hope, as I have a similar size account. My W/L rate is 69-70%, but I am still hemorrhaging money. I cannot get the hang of cutting my losers short and letting my winners run. Because I have such a small size account, my stops are so tight that it’s a real challenge to find that sweet spot of bigger wins and smaller losses.
Of course $50k without day trading $11k just on Lucid. And I'm not an active investor nor do I play any options. So yes a bull market.
No bull market pretty hard not to make any money. No envy that's one of the 7 sins. I congratulated and stated the current market we're in. Love to see this in a bear market that would be worth posting.
Lots of growth stocks ate folks. No down play but actual fact of a bull market.
That statement mean nothing, the only way to make serious money in a market is to catch a trend.
Why did you go live when you did?
Thanks !
Yeah, I re-read your original post after commenting, but forgot to edit mine. Either way though, very awesome stuff!
Awesome. Did you quit it overnight once you felt like you’re at a good place or did you gradually scale out of it?
I see you tweet about AMC a lot. How much of a factor do you think that stock was to your overall success?
I was trying to say congrats to OP for an amazing performance 
I have no idea what your going on about… are you upset with me or what?

Edit/ I read all the comments and nobody besides your dumbass is salty
Thanks
Thanks I'll check out your Twitter
What’s your Twitter? I think you could be worth a follow as well
cool info dude.

do you try and work always till 9pm? (market close), or do you like to log off earlier?

and i guess how about premarket, do you sit down before 2:30pm?

just wondering what your rough working schedule looks like. thanks for sharing your experience buddy, inspiring for me who is just really starting out full time now.
Ever trade mini and micro futures? No borrow fees for shorting. But no free commissions either.
Can you recommend any twitter accounts and prop YT channels?
is a paid room service, not worth it really cause the dude who runs it does 1 or 2 trades a day based on the setup he likes; the OP is one of the mods and they kidn of talk about their trades but you need to have some experience to follow it. If you want the room to avoid it, shoot me a msg so that the rules aren't broken
How much is your position on a single trade?
That makes sense.  I take it most of your trading is done at open then?

Also I'm looking to switch brokers, it sounds like you're happy with TradeZero.  Do they negotiate their commissions or margin rates?
Did you joing bbt community by any chance?
So that’s it, you always risked up to 2% of account based on conviction in setup? Or once you proved consistency you started risking 2%? I’m a point where I’m finding consistency but the fluctuations in P&L when I increase my size spook me. I know it’s an emotional thing just wondering how you worked thru that… Thanks for posting this, very motivational! Hope you kill it today!
[deleted]
it's possible but you might be better off swing trading

sorry, the journal app i'm using doesn't have that functionality
Thanks!
>$17.50 risking a higher low at $17.25. thats 25c risk

wow ok so that's like 1.4% stop, so tight....that's insane it seems like it would get hit constantly and you'd never make gains (obviously not true since you're killing it).

https://i.imgur.com/dNjEDvM.jpg

For example this trade (PALI from today 2/2), maybe my entry sucked, but my stop was what looked like a reasonable support level (which turned out to be 11% loss).  Blew thru stop then stock rebounds .... so maybe I'm right, but timing is wrong...

Would you have set stop at like around 1.39 like I did or where would you have set a stop here?  

This is what totally kills me because to get to 2RR like you said I need to make +20% on a trade like this...
thank you u/Valckrie

look forward to hearing more about your trading journey down the road.
Yeah, I’ve just never crossed that bridge.
This was in December dude, near the end of his journey so far when his account was probably in the hundreds of thousands.
When he says he risked 2%, that’s where his Stop loss is at, not the amount of money he plays with per trade. He could use his entire $1,800 on one trade and only risk 2%, $36 per trade. As long as he averages 50% W/L he is still profitable. He is still profitable trading like this even if his W\L is at 40% with a 2/1 RR and a risk of 2%
my account was 1800 in January, I definitely was not making 1500 or 15000 in a single day back then. the calendar is from December where my account equity is much larger
never used them, sorry
i don't play anymore, and my results were nothing special. even though I think they share many similarities
you can check [trademetria.com](https://trademetria.com) (paid) or [tradeinsight.net](https://tradeinsight.net) (free)
Yep! [TradesViz.com](https://TradesViz.com) !
nope sorry
I'm in Australia.
IBKR has PDT rule
I've been day trading for 7 years. Price action is the way to go. It's mostly free as well. But this will save you lots of headaches.

https://priceactiontradingsystem.com/
Try learning price action. This is the way to go and it's basically free.

Bro, you don't use TOS? The scanners there are amazing, I use it to catch +50% gains consistently.
wait seriously I think you got the wrong guy. i'm not on there
Yes it is, once the position size that would be required gets large enough.
The problem is once your account gets big enough, risking the ""same percentage"" becomes unfeasible - you start getting into liquidity problems, seeing lots of slippage, or buying so many shares that you start having to fill out forms for owning a 5+% portion of the company lol.  The only way around this is to trade larger cap stocks, and those larger cap stocks by their very nature (larger floats, higher stock price, among other things) means they just don't move like small caps do.
Once the account gets large enough if you keep using the same percentage, your trades end up moving the market (or preventing the market from moving if it's a limit order) and reduce the profit you can make on the trade.
i mostly use hard stops
small accounts can trade most things unless you don't have buying power for high priced ones

no mkt cap or float specifically but be aware each category trades differently

you can tell by how much volume is being done per minute or 5minutes and it depends on the price of ticker
that's what I read, don't know about all integrations

you can ask the owner he's on reddit /u/kinfo 

i understand the scepticism, don't have much more to say since i'm not selling anything
Linking only supports real accounts, this is often restricted directly at the broker since all integrations use brokers production environments.  
This should be the case with IB as well since you don´t have access to a flex token in your paper trading account.  


Did you actually manage to link a paper trading account? If so I would be very interested in knowing how in order to prevent this. Feel free to dm me
/u/kinfo reddit account replying right after this user linking it makes this highly suspicious lol

I'm just gonna say bull. And I mean the stinky kind.
Warren buffett is a value investor who handles billions of dollars, and is far from being a daytrader. His risk appetite is very different. It annoys me whenever someone brings up his name in this context. You can't draw this kind of comparison. 

Good daytraders do absolutely make 1-2% per day. There are professional traders with such results working in prop firms.
It is far easier to have exponential gains as a small account trader - you have no liquidity constraints at all. The larger you grow the harder it is to compound. Example it's very easy to get 100% on a $1000 starting equity but like you say, probably impossible on $1 billion equity. I have no doubts that my progress will slow down after a certain point
Yeah. It's remarkable
Day trading is not what Warren Buffett is doing.

Also, these sorts of gains are not possible when you get into the tens of millions of dollars, let alone the billions Buffett manages.

This sort of parabolic account growth really only works for accounts up to maybe a few million, which for most traders, would be plenty lol.
Are you trading stocks or options?
Do you use a stop loss orders?
You can use wider stops, you just need to size down. Learn the connection between stop distance and position size. It's the key to a constant risk of 1%.

So a loss on a 2k account will always be $20. Be it with 20c of risk (100 shares) or a dollar risk (20 shares). The amount you risk on a trade is always the same.
Dude, own what you said or leave. You weren't congratulating him. You we're being sarcastic.
i was profitable on paper trading and thought it would translate across to real. spoiler: it didn't
once i was making multiples of my monthly salary...
same as reddit handle
I stay till market close but eventually I would like to spend less time in front of the screens

I rarely trade premarket anymore
Personally I haven't, but I'm sure you can do fine in futures too
smb capital, seven points capital

search for day traders there are a few lists out there
depends on price of the stock and how many shares you take. both of which depends on the risk for that trade. had a position size up to $1M in a TSLA trade
from stats the best trades have come from 10am-11am. i'm not sure if they negotiate
not that one
i don't use that scans that much because i have enough charts to watch. but in general yeah a large % change usually has a reason behind it, some catalyst or news
your risk is pretty wide but theres nothing inherently wrong with that if you believe it can move 2R in that direction...

the fact is you are longing these smallcap gappers when the market is kinda dead for them right now
Yea you're right. I would like to see a calendar snapshot closer to January. Not saying its not possible but damn just under half a million in profits in a calendar year all while risking 2% of his portfolio is something amazing. Meaning if he would have risked even 10% or 15% a few times he would be a  millionare from $1800. 👏👏
Ok makes more sense
How do you trade so much with a small account and not get hit by pdt?
Thanks bud I'll check it out
Ahhh danm. You are correct. Yeah not many options for traders living outside USA. Especially not for people like me living in South Africa.  Thanks for letting me know and well done with the Profits. It's honestly mind blowing, I'll be really interested to see your journey continue.
TD Ameritrade won't let me open an account.

>+50% gains consistently.

How did you set up the scanner? Premarket pennystock gappers?
Any additional info you would be willing to share would be much appreciated (DM is ok if you’d rather).
Oh shit you’re right hahaha. You trade very similar to the other guy I was thinking of. Where’s your podcast out of curiosity?
[deleted]
You guys are just jealous. *Sigh*
Replying to this comment, is that suspicious too?  


Skepticism is good, I can give you credit for that, if you have questions I will gladly answer them
But that’s risking a lot of your equity no? You said you where risking 2% per trade?
stocks
yes
What was sarcastic congrats or bull market ignoramus
hey valckrie,
hope you are still answering queries in this thread. would appreciate your time answering the below if you can?

just took my first huge drawdown, pretty bummed out. so just wanted to ask a few queries. most important ones for me are about risk i guess.

1) do you use hard stops?
2) do you always know what your max loss is going to be on any trade?
3) how disciplined are you with the risk? i mean averaging down etc... do you think you can improve or do you sometimes give some leeway and buy out of trouble?
4) do you ever have more than 1 trade on at a time?
5) stock selection criteria, i think im right in thinking you have monitors with a total of 14 charts on and you are just waiting for setups?
6) scalping. did you ever go through a scalping phase? that's what im in at the moment really, dont like holding longer than 5 minutes really... or should i say 'i am more comfortable' holding for under 5 minutes.
7) mentor/chat room. there are a bunch out there really, if i was to join any it would be the one where the lead guy's initials are NM, first name rhymes with gate. i don't know if you have any opinions on good places for me to idle do you? i am fully doing this on my own.

just so you know my situ, not employed. have savings. trying to make trading dooable. really just want to try and make 100 dollars a day at the moment, 2k a month average. but with the huge mess up last week whereby i added in and added in didnt define or stick to any risk or plan,  bummed out but know i need to learn from this (was paper trading for a looooooong time there is no excuse in what i did really)

thanks dude
Thanks. Do you have an alert for spotting breakouts/downs?
Do you ever have an issues trading with a size that big?
last December: https://i.imgur.com/S7AMBD1.png
i'm not US based
I can’t tell if this guy has a cash account or not. But pdt doesn’t affect cash accounts. Only margin.
IBKR does not have PDT Rule. They moved their headquarters from the USA to London at the end of 2020. So they don’t have to force the PDT rule anymore. I know this for a fact because I switches over a month ago and am under the PDT rule at the moment.
Not necessarily pennies, I trade options bro, but yeah stock volume min 100k, options volume min 1k, net change option min +.01, days to exp max 15, nothin crazy bro
My bad, I gotta find a way to get notifications on this thing lol...but sure, YouTube sizzle index... Jonathan rose specifically... that's my exact strategy
it's not really a podcast and it's not public haha
both of them can be good in different scenarios
It's not the fact that you replied that makes it very suspicious, it's the speed of when you replied which raises my eyebrows
how so? risking 20$ in a $1000 account isn't much. say you win 2R then you made 40$. and if you take many trades every week and month and you have a positive expectancy outcome then you eventually grow it
You know there is a rule in this sub about not being an asshole?
i set alerts at price levels on TradingView and have 16 small charts on my side monitors watching
Good insights for new trader/small account. Thanks for sharing
So you traded the NYSE from outside the US. How did this affect your time zones/working hours? Or are you in similar time zones so it didn't matter much?

Fantastic post by the way, I've saved it. Very thorough,  and to be honest, indicative of why you have gotten to where you are now. 

Question on crypto, how much did you dabble into the crypto markets; was it minor compared to your stoke trading?
Don't you need to wait to trade with settled funds?
What's PDT?
He got hit with borrow fees does that mean it was a margin account?
It does effect cash accounts under $25k if you make 4 roundtrip (with in 24 hour) day trades with in any 5 day period.  The SEC allows brokers to  remove the pdt requirement if you call and ask, but they will only do it 3 times a year.  As soon as you reach the SEC pdt guidelines, your broker is forced to only allow closing transactions for the rest of the year.
But, aren’t you allowed to day trade with a cash account?
As long as your account is not carried by IB LLC or IB UK. For example if you're Canadian and your account is on IB Canada then you're not subject to PDT. If your Canadian but your account is on IB LLC [US] then you are subject to PDT. The issue with IB imo is their platform, TWS, it's not the best for charting and interface, and it uses smart routing.
Fair question!

I use various services which detect mentions on social and on web in general, this post triggered an alert and I replied

Let me know if anything else, as said, I understand skepticism and I am happy to reply to questions to kill any doubt about authenticity
What was your % profit each month?
Then you need to follow the rule.
GMT time zone is 2:30pm to 9pm, not so bad

I never traded Crypto itself, only the stocks related to it, such as bitcoin miner companies like MARA RIOT
In a cash acct yes 2 days for stock 1 day for options and if he’s doing only options then he has all his money next day to do it again
Pattern Day Trading
Maybe I miss understood or I am still hungover from New Years.
sorry I don't have that stat readily available. Would have to look at equity and pnl for every month individually
I’m very into this sector. Do you trade options? Does the fact riot/Mara have high premiums relative to competition weigh your decision on which companies to trade?
Thanks, American thing didn't know the short form of it
Ah ok. What do you reckon 5%? 50%?
sorry i'm not an expert in options nor the crypto space
Well 0% in 2020 since I was not net profitable. Then maybe 30% some months, 50% or higher in some months, some flat 0% months",,,,,,
Boatim Inc. $BTIM : Short Squeeze next?!,104.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreet/comments/mknroo/boatim_inc_btim_short_squeeze_next/,,,,,,,
I'm giving a TedTalks presentation on Blockchain!,112.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/tjlr5e/im_giving_a_tedtalks_presentation_on_blockchain/,"I think explaining the core differences between defi and cefi are necessary. Like how cefi means your assets can be seized vs defi where you are the owner of those assets and unless your wallet is compromised you are the only one who can move assets. I think mentioning how current interest rates pale in comparison to what can be made via staking and how holding money or even assets (shares, stocks, etc) in traditional bank accounts means they’re being used against you such as brokers lending out shares you own without your permission, some essentially just giving you ious and how instant settlement and immutable ledger technology combats predatory behavior.
Also consider looking at applications of zero knowledge proofs in blockchain and cryptography
There’s too much stuff.. I’d say someone understanding these topics should probably give the talk.   
    
Regardless, my advice is keep it simple. Most people here are suggesting amazing use cases  (some that I follow personally) but they will distract from the talk to someone new.   
    
You want to talk about:   
   
- handling democracy and immutability  
through code    
   
- what btc solved (blockchain 1.0).  
   
- what eth solved (blockchain 2.0). Here you can give a vault example through smart contracts, DeFi, NFT, and one more advanced use like Descentralized Identifiers (DiD).  
   
The on challenges:   

- energy, descentralización, interoperability, regulation. Those are the big issues.    

- In energy you can introduce PoS (without going much to the technicals).    

- In descentralisation you can talk about the threelema of blockchain. You can talk about governance here too, DAOs as an exciting example.   

- In interoperability there are 2 types. One is chain interoperability, here you can talk about bridges and layer 0 blockchains (polkadot, cosmos, etc). Other one is between blockchain and real world assets. Here you can talk about oracle and other protocols   

- In Regulation you can give both extremes, like San Salvador and China/India. And what the scenario is in the West
   
That’s it
You might point out that Blovkchain != Token and NFT != PNG - there is so much hate for NFTs and shitcoins from non crypto heads that Blockchain tech in general and esp. NFT is not being understood. Course it is getting abused for nonsense just cuz its new but there useful stuff there. Check out the Mastering Monero paper available at site of same name.

When it comes to what can be solved with blockchain, DeSci (Decentralized Science) is not to be missed. There are various projects on how to use cryptos to support research. For example, check out r/cryptoforscience for at to read more about it.
“Very slow, write-only serverless database.”

There you go!
The Think Lair YouTube channel by Keir Fonlow-Bates has amazing short clips. It's criminally underrated.
When speaking of legal issues, it can't be over-emphasized how destructive tax classifications have been: having to track basis and profit/loss on every single satoshi in and out of every single wallet, for daily transactional use, is so impractical that it makes it de facto illegal to use crypto as money in countries where it is taxed as such (thus helping to keep even large market cap coins stuck in purely speculative cycles...there's nothing else to do with them *but* speculate).
I think you could pick example - voting. How election could be ran on blockchain and be available forever for scrutiny. It would practically eliminate possibility of rigging election, or to be precise - rigging it without proof.
Blockchain is a public read-for-free write-for-fee database. An NFT is a piece of data with you name on it (FT: bob- 10ETH -> NFT: bob- ANY_DATA)
just an idea. I've come across people who use the tech and people who understand alot of the tech and use the tech. Maybe give confidence to people new to the space that you don't need to understand physics or how anything works to use the new tech. Only geeks, coders, and those curious need to dive deep into the tech.
Smart contracts = vending machine for an example

One of the issues blockchain faces is the privacy laws that are popping up around the world these last few years. Due to the immutable nature of blockchain it increases thresholds for companies to use blockchain in certain processes. There are projects out there that tackle this, among others LTO Network: [https://medium.com/ltonetwork/legalthings-one-blockchain-gdpr-made-possible-68a5ce09e7ca](https://medium.com/ltonetwork/legalthings-one-blockchain-gdpr-made-possible-68a5ce09e7ca) (older article).  


LTO is also working on Web3.0 solutions which is of course where everything is headed. The creation of self sovereign data for people is the next step into the digitization of the world. And where NFTs are merely touching on the aspects of digital ownership, steps are already being taken to improve on current structures and bring true digital asset ownership into the space: https://blog.ltonetwork.com/litepaper/
For ethical resources, i believe Whiteboard crypto on Youtube is a great place to start. Also for the first part you can use the example of how blockchain is making it easier for funds to move around like with ukrain receiving millions of dollars into donations  through the blockchain and in a matter of minutes.

You could also speak about how blockchain is bringing about a sustainable future when we have entities like the HBAR Foundation dumping hundreds of millions of dollars to encourage sustainable development.

Good luck with the presentation!
remind folks how important privacy and anonymity is in crypto. between corrupt governments, corporations and institutions and sjw/woke culture, keeping and maintaining your freedom and sovereignty means being able to take your finances do what you want without oversite from those mentioned above is the only fighting chance to make meaningful change in the world.  Anyone that tells you neither privacy or anonymity isn't worth it are blatantly ignorant and or direct adversaries to crypto. Ask Satoshi Nakamoto . where bitcoin stopped, monero began.

kyc survallaince in the name of aml and other bullshit acronyms are just an excuse to control the population and the limit the human experience. fuck social credit systems. fuck cbdc's. 

the crypto tenants- decentralization, trustlessness, permissionlessness, censorship resistance, privacy.
Worth briefly mentioning *why* crypto is needed by showing examples of the worst examples of civil forfeiture, dictators stealing the countries people's savings, and political attacks by targeting political dissidents money.

Unfortunately most people will likely just not get it because it often hurts people they don't like. For example recent sanctions on Russia, ""nobody"" cares because it's universally accepted that Russia is doing bad things, but the citizens are struggling too and crypto would better allow them to escape the country with their savings intact, but people don't care about that because everyone is more preoccupied with hurting the enemy than protecting their ally.

I also think the Canadian trucker attack on people's money was quite atrocious, even though I partially do not agree with them on a lot of things I find the way Canada handled it by confiscating their money and labelling them as domestic terrorists for protesting to be downright dystopic as it sets a precedent for doing the same thing with more and more minor disturbances until eventually protesting is practically outlawed if you value your bank account. Dangerous precedent.


I think you might be interested in talking about Proof of Humanity on Kleros. Vitalik has an interest in using PoH to distribute Universal Basic Income to all of humanity by using sybil resistance to ensure all users are unique humans.

To Vitalik that is one way he wants to see his ""socialist agenda"" come into play, so it goes to show that crypto is more than just a right-wing tool like many unfortunately have painted it as when crypto is for *everyone*.

Kleros is not anywhere near ready for global adoption even if it had increased scale already, but the subjective oracles themselves are quite interesting as a concept.
An important one is governance.  
How is the process of developing and updating the software that is running on nodes.  


Another is distribution. How well are nodes distributed geographically, amount of them, and if they are anonymous or not (known nodes have less quality because they can be contacted and facilitate collusion, which is not good for consensus)  


Another is scalability. Is there any centralization 'force' that impeeds network expansion?  


HTH
Good summary. One thing I'd definitely add in challenges  (as part of the decentralization topic/trilemma) is the issue of scaling transactions/transaction fees. This is IMO the biggest issue by far that is being faced by Smart Contract platforms aka Ethereum the premier smart contract chain.
It’s a TedX hosted on my college campus. I haven’t been given too many details other than expectations, speech length (12min), and other requirements quite yet. I was told those will be emailed to me within a week
don't like to upvote this, but did it bc it is true...
Why such an extreme opinion? Not everyone is interested in making purely anonymous transactions. Are you saying that 99.99% of crypto transactions are utterly pointless to the people who make them?

The original point was to be a replacement for a cashless payment system, not anonymity.
“Very slow, **append-only** serverless database.”

It is definitely more inefficient to have to look up the merkle tree to verify the history of the transaction, and that's part of the flaws of append-only blockchains.
Agreed, left gas behind. Haven't used eth in a while so forgot about it a bit :S
Watch the gensler MIT class in blockchain technology, gives a good explanation of the crypto world as it exists circa 2018. From their I would go in one of two directions: the pros and cons of the various smart contract platforms or the different ways dApps and NFTs create value by disintermediating existing rent seeking business models and financialization currently unused resources

For the first I would focus on the block chain dilemma as a starting point and run from their, for the second I would probably pick some existing services and explain the potential value add in a concrete way with numbers based on total addressable market
Fully verified, kyc transactions = government can shut the whole thing down with a tweet
Awe, it's cute how you've never thought about this before.
>bullshit. anonymity and privacy were the last things that satoshi wanted to put into btc because he knew how important it was and even had convos with fluffypony one of the creators of monero about that need. people are definitely interested in their privacy and anonymity but dont know how to attain it in a meaningful ways and the bullshit parasite class thats running the show wants to scare folks away from gaining their freedoms back.
Yup! It’s like XML. There are situations where it is the perfect tool. But usually… not
so are you a XMR enthusiast?
Maybe you shouldn't be giving suggestions on cryptotechnology if you're new to blockchains and don't understand pseudonimity or Monero. These are very basic blockchain concepts.
No idea what that is. I just heard a basic Blockchain explanation once and asked a couple questions like, ""If it's a fully public transaction log and no one can get money into crypto without a paper trail....the government can just say you can't move any money in or out, and if you do, they can just come and arrest you and take your stuff. Is that right?""

Seems like a fine store of value...with even less inherent value than 99.9% of the gold out there, but does anyone think the powers that be aren't either going to make sure they can control it or shut it down and start their own?

Seems like for the idea to work at all, it at least needs to be as anonymous as cash.

Edit: That said, smart contracts seem like a big slice of fried gold dipped in dark chocolate. If crypto can be reliable enough to back smart contracts, THAT is the future.

Edit: ...but you CANNOT do full verification or full retention. You must accept and implement partial verification and must algorithmically sunset most transactions.
Awe, gatekeeping...that's adorable. Maybe if you're a fuddite who thinks Blockchain is difficult to understand you should just let the adults talk and go back to listen to your Jojo Siwa tracks. At any rate, I certainly hope you enjoy being on the cheer team.
Sounds like XMR is right up your alley. /r/Monero

Monero sounds like what the doucheiest bartender in Destin calls money when he asks if you have enough of it to cover the round for the table before he says, ""Just messin' with you champ!"" and gives you the double finger guns.
Meh, this sort of thing has sunset for me, but the kids have some in their college funds.

Good luck changing the world, you crazy kids.
Monero literally just means ""Money"". And it is the best money because it is the only fungible coin as your own wallet cannot become ""tainted"".",,,,,,

Are you a believer in cryptocurrency? Bitcoin if you have to chose one?
Hi Dude :-)! I would have never imagined back then that I would be addressing a message directly to you. Although as traders we were already accustomed to chatting through the Reuters Dealing system, well ahead of internet all professional traders/dealers  were already interconnected live through a Web that provided real time prices, news, charts images and words.
Back then I was a proprietary trader for a US bank, based in Luxembourg and we were one of the few market makers in ECU. Your story made a great buzz among our relatively small  Forex club and I believe because many of us were feeling a great degree of emphaty for your experience as at some point of our life as a trader we all faced the same issue that you had to deal with...I can actually describe a very similar situation: my boss took a short 5 MM USD/DEM spot position (I think it was around the time the rate dropped to 1.36). By the evening the trade was loosing 50 pips and given it was the end of the month and his own boss (the CEO of the bank) did not want to disrupt the monthly reported P&l the position was ""temporarily"" swapped and placed on the account of a ""friend"" customer. Needless to say that from that day on the USD started a long term rally and we never saw the spot price at which the position was opened...so every month the position was swapped and the hole grew deeper until that day that the customer who was ""hosting"" the FX trade on his account became less friendly and forced the CEO to come out of the locker and face his responsibility...I do not recall the exact amount of the loss but something around 2MM$, around 40 figures loss. The CEO lost his job but eventually was hired a month later as head treasurer of a known Luxembourg bank, thanks to usual banking mafia. The bank I worked for repayed entirely the losses to the customer account with a little bonus to avoid a a court case. And life went on as usual. Certainly the amounts involved were nowhere near yours, but the case is exactly similar and I can tell you about many other similar anecdotes. By the way a few years later I read your book (I devoured it on a flight to HK) which helped me understand the real story behind the mess and the lies the media at the time wanted to depict. Thanks to your book I also grew a lot if emphaty for you, to the point that while reading some paragraphs my hands were litteraly sweating. I m really happy to see how you overcame the whole experience.
I think you should consider buying XRP, it will appreciate greatly in 2020
Hi Mr Leeson. Would you buy individual stocks right now or drop more into a vanguard index fund to take advantage of covid 19 prices?

I hoped I could try day trading to make some money while applying for a new job... yeah.... about that...,1973.0,https://i.redd.it/0u8l631mn8j61.png,"Daytrading without years of EXP is Russian roulette
Bro paper trade first. Damn dude.... you'll be okay but you don't make it into the MLB without going to batting practice.
I urge you to use a simulator to practice on so you don’t lose any money and end up just hating trading all together. The people in this group will all agree when I say trading, especially day trading is a skill... a damn difficult skill. Learn as much as you can, try different things out on the simulator, use different strategies, lose your ass! It’s fake money so it don’t matter! Once you’ve got confidence in yourself, your knowledge, skill set etc, then move over to a real trading account. I’be spent months on simulators learning as much as I can and I’d still consider myself in the crawling stage trading. 

The experts in here are smart as hell, know the game, have been at it for a while, and have put in the necessary hours to make day trading a sustainably profitable side hustle/ or career.
Never change your investment strategy before you're done with the current one. The most loss is by investors who don't stick with their strategy, they jump from one loser to the next until they run out of money.
Just wanted to clarify some things. I'm not trading because I'm desperate for money. I have an amount invested that I am prepared to lose and have enough in savings to last me until I get a new job. I had hoped I could make a little money off day trading to justify extra spending.

As a whole I have still made money off the stock market. I've been investing for about 6 months and before day trading had made a 60% profit on investment. Now it's down to 40% profit only.

I've learned a lesson about the volatility of the market and taken a hit that was responsible for me to make.
Hey bud, its highly recommended in your journey through day trading, that you understand the fundamentals behind Candlesticks and some general signs that the patterns convey.
Same boat you man...I feel it.
Lost all the money I made in last 6 months. At least I'm not negative from what I started
So hows it doing to look for a job while looking at charts everyday? Been there done that. 

Dont forget to actually look for a job in the process! Just my 2 cents.
🤣 it happens
Would you be down anyway, considering the dip?

You probably have fucked up, but nearly everyone is red for the past week or two...
Nah you’re fine. Plenty of people’s accounts look like that. Tech got destroyed this week
I would say trading because you have to or think you are guaranteed to make money is the worst time to do it. That’s probably why so many people are saying to paper trade but even then there is no better lesson than blowing up an account with your own money. 

I’d recommend studying candlesticks, candlestick patterns, support/resistance and supply/demand. Learn about risk reward ratios and you will see how you can be profitable being right only 50% of the time. Focus on your percentage gain and not the numbers. Compare it to how much you would earn in a savings account, often less than 1%...compounding is your friend! 

After that, study charts and backtest the strategy you want to use. If you do use indicators try to keep your charts as clean as possible because they often send conflicting signals and can even make you doubt your trade. I’m not the most profitable trader but I have been working on tightening up my losses and that itself has made my few wins that much more valuable. 
Patience and conviction are going to be your best friend. I’ve alerted my friends to tickers that ran 100% without me because I had no confidence or patience.

At the same time, be right or get out. Stop losses are your best friend. Protect your damn money. Hope you have better luck as the markets hopefully recover from here ideally!
Only path you have now is up
Guess I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue...
Learning to day trade is expensive. Even more so when you keep eating red and green crayons.
day trading on robinhood???
A mix of swing trading and some day trades work well for me.
> Robinhood
I wouldn’t day trade on robinhood or I won’t use robinhood at all
Day trading on Robinhood? Interesting....
I never bothered with paper trading. Watch the charts for a while and make some smaller cash trades until you sharpen your skills. My account looked just like yours when I 1st started, then I vowed to trade safe and small until I got back to using house money. Now that I'm up,I'll risk more sometimes, but my average trades have been safer and im winning 85 percent of them now with a smaller profit. Even on all these red days, you can definitely still make money daily.
Yeah I lost 17K my first year. You need to practice a lot to be good at day trading. Practice in a paper account until you prove you can be successful. I’m sure that’s not what you want to hear but it’s the best advice you’ll get.
Looks like someone watched a couple WT vids and got all excited.
I’ve chosen the wrong day to give up crack cocaine

&#x200B;

keep wisely
Learn on a paper trade yes it won't feel as real money but trust me you'll be disappointed to lose your paper money too. There are things you are not aware of as an amateur trader paper trade will help you discover those things much better because only a calm and playful mind can learn. The emotions that come with losing real money will not let you see those things. This is not to say real money trading won't teach you, it'll but it will be a different lesson. So dividing those lessons getting your edge on your strategies on paper money and the rest on real money is better than to go through it all on real account.
I'm losing about $20/day from my day trading - and that's from a $600 account. (now $500) Im wondering how long I keep saying ""I'm learning"" and when I just decide I don't like this game anymore.
Can't forget you're day trading during a market pullback. Don't be too hard on yourself. Keep at it. You'll figure something out eventually.
I think you should reexamine your strategy. Long-term market downturns shouldn't fuck your daytrading strategy; in fact, a solid daytrading strategy should be *more* insulated from downturns like that than other long-term investment strategies.

For comparison, I've been daytrading a few days a week since December. I'm playing with a tiny $50 account, but so far I've got an 80% success rate on profitable trades, and my account is up 8.3% overall.

(I also made like $10k in my $100k papertrading account shorting AAPL, cuz I got lucky and accurately guessed this tech bubble pop was coming lol. But I would never make a trade like that irl, even if I had the money.)
Dude day trading is a skill that must be practiced first.
Absolutely pissed at myself that my friends convinced me to get into swing trades. I’m a day trader so I usually never hold stocks overnight but two weeks ago my dumbass friends who joined trading in January convinced me to join their swing trading discord server. So I said fuck it why not. Bought some stocks to hold through March and guess what. All down 10-30%... I’m never trusting anyone but myself ever again.
Robinhood is such trash how can you have no y or even x axis on a chart like this. Also not good for day trading, at least use thinkorswim by TD
The current system is designed to destroy people who are just getting started. Because of the PDT rule, If you don't have $25K for unlimited trading you're constantly trying to eke out as much profit as possible with those few trades you're allowed. It makes you a shitty, risky trader. I would avoid setting stop losses until well above my entry price to avoid immediately tripping over it, and then wait way too long to bail because I didn't want to blow the chance of a reversal.
Hopefully you’ve studied a little bit? 

I’ve just recently gotten into it. But I read several books, took a free online class, and watched some great YouTube videos before actually doing anything. 

Also started watching Bloomberg on roku to get accustomed to the language. 

It can be done, just takes some work. 

You don’t just run up in the bitch guns a blazin.
That looks like a gold mine to a day trader lol
This is the way.
Making money day trading? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Good one. 

Day trading isn’t something you just jump into. 99% of day traders lose money and are never profitable. Use simulators, paper trade, practice, practice, practice, and even after all of that, you’ll probably still lose money. I day traded for a brief bit, and honestly, I did turn a profit. However, it was extremely small, and it just wasn’t worth the stress. I’d rather gamble it all in crypto than to go back into that mess.
Let’s tag all the should I quit my day job right now and yolo day trading with all my savings people.
Day trading on Robinhood was your first mistake and kinda shows your lack of research to be completely honest. Not trying to be disrespectful here, but daytrading is definitely not a quick buck kind of gig lol. 
To be fair, I blew up my Robinhood account on meme stocks a few weeks ago so I am mot one to talk about not doing research
I'm sticking entirely to swingtrading. Every time I try to daytrade I end up winning at first then losing eventually lol
How many trades was this?
You either make money or you learn something. It takes years, daytrading is hard!
“Day trading”... with robinhood... u dumb bitch
I see some potential. Looks like you clawed your way back up from a deep hole. Keep it up and stack them tendies brah
This ain’t a game

What do we say to day trading today....
Hopefully you learned to do your homework before starting in on new things.

90% of day traders fail, and it's because they jump in without knowing what they're doing. This sub is home to a lot of them, lol.
Haha I did this same exact thing.  I’m down all my profit for the year now.
Why would you try with real money? 95% of your time should have been studying and not actual trading.
Maybe try shorting
Its easy to pick flowers in the spring and hard to find em in the winter. But they are there. Day trading is not for the faint of heart. And skip it all together unless you know what you are doing. Big wallet. Find small returns. Go big. Or skip this strategy and go longer plays.
1M is too short to infer anything at all.
Your timing is excellent lol. 90% of day traders lose money
Who’s going back to work?
Paper trading isn't going to help a lot if you don't know a thing or two about trading setups.

Watch some youtube videos on technical analysis, until you get it; otherwise, there's not point in trading at all.

If you don't why you're entering a trade, other than ""I want to make money"" then don't enter the trade.

Get the skills then make the Bill$
Zoom out
yea..... that was about spot on for me too
I paper trade and I can tell you my emotions are the same whilst trading with real money lol. I get angry af at first when I’m losing on a paper trade but I get over it quick. I do well paper trading though. Not so much of losing anymore
I just put my first real swing trades last Friday. One of em was on WKHS. Haha. Haha. 

I wanna die
Sending positive vibes homie
Me to brother
try day trading companies with a sma 200+ whatever you lose in profit you’ll eventually get back with a return
Looks like mine
Try combine trading here is $50 off https://app.topsteptrader.com/refer/sign-up/c07dfe

Here you can trade with emotions while securing to not lose money and you will improve your skills.
So it was you... please leave ahahah
Try trading with small positions, ie $100 positions.  You can use all the rules in your trading plan. This is better than paper trading.
That shit sucks
Was the market red for you guys today?
I switched away from day trading and I mainly do short term swings since I’m usually working during prime day trade hours and I make way better money now haha.
Press f to pay respect
Yuh don’t day trade on Robinhood haha. Did you set limits?
Yea. Total buzzkill for me but the education is legit. You feel ever dollar going so much further than those 4 years of college though. This time it’s important!
Takes experience and time. Take classes to learn basic strategies
Easy game!
Same
Yaa these last 2 weeks have been very rough
Yeah day trading is gambling don’t care what anyone says.
Have rules and stick to them no matter your emotions triggered
Buy Psychedelic stocks and just sit with them. You’ll make it all back. r/PsychedelicBets. Thank me later ;)
I feel you... But with no pain there can be no gains! 💪
RIP. Unless you have a Bloomberg terminal and high rate data feed, just trade 1-3 month time horizons. That's about as short term as retail investors can/should aim for.
thanks for showing me the ropes
No successful day trader hasn’t failed many times first. Did you really expect to make money off the bat? The market will take your money before you succeed are you strong enough to make it to the other side
Without Vwap, avg daily, avg vol, yesterday’s high, or other trend lines drawn, were you just hoping for ABC, or some momentum breakout? Is this the actual chart or just a joke?
Lately I have been enjoying waking up and not automatically in the red.
Honestly that's why I'm actually grateful for the PDT rule. PDT rule forced me to study the market for years while I saved up $25k, to take it way more seriously. If you take it seriously, you arent daytrading on RH.
Sounds like fun. What do you win?
Even with years of experience it is
Does paper trading work tho? A huge part of this is nerve and emotions and paper trading doesn’t let you experience that. Only good ol hemorrhaging money hones that skill /s (but not even really sarcasm tbh).

What is this gay bear shit. Diamond hands or GTFO

“It’s fake money, so it dont matter”.

Then what’s the point?
Train like you fight. If every cent doesn’t matter, then you’re not learning as much as you can by paper trading.
Trade it like it’s real. Because one day it will be. And that day it will matter. We can not control the things of which we are unaware. And if you havent allowed yourself to experience the emotions that go along with the rise and fall of the market, no amount of paper trading will keep you from failing.
any good simulator recommendations? been trying to find one for a whumw
Looking at his chart, I’ve pointed out where the world was willing to provide general support, but absolutely resisted any day trading antics. A bad time to go all in, for sure. https://i.imgur.com/iWtEJBJ.jpg
=))))
I lost a lot during my first two years of serious trading. I tend to slowly climb up until getting fucked up big time, rinse and repeat. Completely dodged the market crash last March and rode with the bull market. I tend to be careful now and take smaller risks because I want to keep what I earn and don't want to lose the hard-earned money that took me months to accumulate.
And I would like to add if you're going to trade the markets it pretty much has to be a full-time job.  A couple years ago I was able to use ToS app to make money while at work.  Yet it also cost me money when I wasn't able to use my phone to make trades.
I also recommend having two accounts.  One for trading, maintain $2k if you can.  And one, like RH or Webull, for investments.
Its the hope that kills you... 

I don't believe that but just learned that phrase from watching Ted Lasso
This is maybe not typical for this sub but what worked for me was switching to trading weeklies. Normally you can inverse the open, or play a break over premarket/daily high or low for a nice percent or so move. With weekly options you’re pretty much guaranteed a 10% return on that. Later in the week gains and losses are amplified too cause options are priced by time to expiration. If you’re wrong you have to decide whether to average down or cut your losses though which can be stressful
No one is 100% profitable all the time, the trick is in sizing positions, you don't want to be down more than 40% of your portfolio, not because is painful but because it gets matematically harder to get in positive again ( less funds = need bigger gainz to cover up). So always do proper sizing. That said I'm swing trading right now because I lack the experience for day trading plus my broker (T212) is an absolute joke and I'm just expanding my portfolio so I can migrate to a tool that fits my needs better.
Umm swing trading is definitely a lot easier to profit off of then day trading. You probably didn’t close out your positions when you had gains and got greedy.
Blame no body but yourself, Swing trading is actually easier than day trading
I love when people think the 25K would magically make you a better day trades. Guess what. It makes you lose money faster.
What a champions mindset!
 Only people in losing positions say this when they are to emotional to do their work the way they should
Everyday <3
Green candle means go all in!
We'll have to keep a running tab on his moves so we can inverse them
[removed]
What I found with the pdt rule is that I would end up sticking into a trade too long hoping to maximize the swing since trades were limited and using larger positions than I should have. Now than I'm over the 25k I find myself using smaller sizes and not worrying about if I get out of a good trade earlier than the very top. I dont ever sell if it's a losing trade and just let it go to my stop loss which I also size smaller now.
I put $100 into an Ameritrade account to practice swing trading.  I haven't withdrawn a dime and only have sold 2 positions so far.  Anything dangerously stupid I should avoid? I don't care if I lose the money I'm wondering about unforeseen fees/taxes.
Well....millions.....or an account that goes to 0.00
[deleted]
Another good way to get a feel is to start with a very small size. I quickly learned that paper wasn’t going to cut it for me so I started by trading with one share each time and slowly worked my way up.
Also paper trading you are always filled...not 100% true with real trading.
Absolutely. Use that or a fake trading app to see if you can make a profit on there before risking your money. Also, A risk management strategy with stop loss orders built in is essential to not nuking your account.
In my opinion no it doesn’t. Either emotionally or technically. I’ve had issues with think or swim not executing paper trades when I know for a fact the same trade in a real account would execute. Also like you said your nerves aren’t in it on a paper trade, even when you’re trading 10$ you can feel your blood surging through your veins waiting on it to hit your exit price. You just don’t get that with a paper trade.
I have a rule, never buy at the open wait until 930 and make sure you watch your moving averages for the week or month to see what kind of trading pattern you have first. Some of the stocks go up after 930/940. I never trade on a rainy day either. Rainy in New York City that is.
It’s funny because some of the main advice I’ve gotten/seen is to not bother wasting time on paper trading because it won’t do anything to prepare you for actual trading. If you want to get a better handle on the programs or tools you’ll be using to trade that’s what paper trading is for.
Yea, definitely. I'm up 224% on my paper trading account and down 70% on my cash account. Your livelihood and emotions go hand in hand. It's all about having a plan around how much you are willing to lose before your next move.
There’s many reasons why 80% of traders lose money. One of the reasons is that they go live too early without 100% trusting and proficient with their strategy. And I’m not saying ‘try strategy for 1 week make money ok go’ I’m talking recorded journaling on paper with uploads to tradervue checking your drawdowns and psychology if it’s compatible with said strategy. You do this for 6 weeks with metrics such as accuracy and profit ratios in good measurements. If you don’t know any of what I just said, you’re not ready
I don’t paper trade. But I have a kraken account with 200$ in it. I’m doing small trades 10-30 at a time. I’m up 5$ right now.
When I paper trade, I'm a stock trading genius. When I trade for real, all I'm left with is paper.
Yes and no. You certainly don't get the emotions. But it depends on how you use it. I use it to test strategies, especially when it comes to positions that are failing.  Anyone can trade a winning position but what do you do when things head south as they have been for the past few days? How do you trade that? Or do you stay out all together? So days like the last few offer me a rare opportunity to fine tune exit strategies or see what went wrong.

I also use it to test strategies I want to try in the future so I can observe the mechanics and come up with rules I'll use in live trading. It helps me remove the emotional bit when I trade new strategies live because I can just ignore the fact that it's real money. I'm miles from where I was emotionally even 5 years ago. I can now look at a sea of red and shrug. Either it will go according to plan or I'll start with my protocol for failing positions. 

As it stands today, all i have are shares of stocks I really believe in and am willing to be in long term and one PCS - I closed everything else last week.

For the failing credit spread - I plan to roll out a few weeks. It bottomed out so fast I couldn't do anything about it this morning. It happens. Of course, I may let it go for max loss which means no touchy. So I'll watch it for another day or two and decide if I want to just let it die or try to roll it. It's a pretty small position so either way, I'm fine.

These things happen.
You definitely have a point. The two emotions that you have to master are fear and greed. With paper trading you don't really experience that. It's something that only comes with live trading
Math doesn’t lie. Sentiment is a game. Break down your thesis into what is fact and what is smoke. Fact will win every time. No company doing well fails. Most companies trying to turn things around will fail. Math doesn’t lie.
Yeah I heard a lot of people say that. I haven’t moved from paper trading yet, but for me personally I get “nerve and emotions” while doing paper trading since I often am a perfectionist in the bad way, but it seems to help here. Also, using a rigid trading strategy for exits hopefully makes it more helpful since i dont allow myself to hold longer than the chosen exit strategy.
I for one cannot practise with demo accounts and whatnot. My brain just stops processing cause I know there's nothing at stakes. 

Trading a small portfolio has done wonders for me while learning to trade.
I agree but don't use emotion. No emotions. Logic. Logic, facts, and math. Emotion is bullshit because that dollar in your pocket damn sure doesn't have any.
I upvoted you because I made over $300k on GME because of unrealistic expectations like this one. If you're being sarcastic I offer a golf clap. If serious, I offer my capital gains tax for your bailout.
Thinkorswim has a paper trading ability, and imo is already the best tool in the industry for trading anyway.
Webull is good. Others like tradingview just let you place huge positions so it's not realistic
tradingview is pretty good
Paper traders could give the wife or gf or a charity $10 for every week they are down on paper trading. That would put a little risk flavor in, without taking real loses.
Well yes trade like it’s real money. I meant IF he ends up losing it all... it isn’t going to hurt him financially
> Train like you fight. 

Yeah but I don't fight. Because I'm not twelve.
Yeah i don't get that.  I treated it like a game ans the money was the score. When i lost, i took it personal and hated loosing my money.  Up 65% four the year
Yup. I learned with small cash accounts and blew up 2 times before consistent
it’s just a reverse head and shoulders. should fill out soon...
I guess you have to experience it first hand to learn. I waa living the good life till all my profits were given back. Will have to be more careful in the future.
It’s a preference
I said I’m pissed at myself so yeah I’m blaming myself. And never did I mention one was easier than the other? What’re y’all reading
It’s not about the money.. any margin account can still make ridiculous heavily-leveraged bets. The more trades you can make, the less precious they become. You don’t have to white-knuckle through after hours just to stretch that trade to the next day.
Hell, program an algo for it
[removed]
You wanna watch out for wash sales. If you sell a stock for a loss you have to wait 30 days before rebuying
If you lose it all within the year you owe nothing up to $3k. You pay taxes on every gain you realize, once you pass $3k in losses you still have to pay taxes on your gains even if you lose those gains later. Wash sale losses and gains dont count toward your 3k loss allowance either, so if you lose $100 on MSFT and gain $100 on MSFT that same month, you are at a net loss on taxes. Way out of that is mark to market designation. Other than that I dont think there are any unforseen taxes.
So what you're saying is ... potentially unlimited upside and strictly limited downside? EZ money!
0 is only second to worst case scenario. Margins, -100%... Or worse. Depending on how much were playing with here.
I'm currently paper trading for practice. Agree the emotions are definitely decreased but it's good for a couple things. First, if you can't make money in paper trading then you'll never make it with real money. It's invaluable for getting to know the software and get out quite a bit of mistakes with the learning curve. Had a few whoops moments that were purely technical.
The biggest thing here though is that whole day trader limit crap.

I'd love to do a bunch of single stock trades to get better and not risk much.  But you need 25k before hand or you only get 3 day trades a week.  And that ain't gonna do crap for you.
Actually I find it completely the opposite - using TOS paper account, my orders sit there FOREVER and never go through.
After power hour?
also for working out your strats, u want to be robotic in your trading b4 putting $
Yes I know. And I’m saying paper trading doesn’t help with that because it’s not real money so you THINK you are being emotionless until you start actually using money and then you realize you aren’t.
 I didn't experience much difference in emotion. But I did find out that my strategy was not consistent. I got real lucky on my first few trades and thought I had it figured out. Blew up my account. Went to paper trading. Wish I would've started with paper. Im going to try it again with a micro account and penny stocks.
Me too. I skipped paper trading and just made some mistakes with a couple hundred. Figured it out over the span of a few months and then scaled up my operation.
Zero logic, zero math, zero facts. This is /daytrading, think you are talking /investing. 

What is the P/E? I have zero interest. 

Emotions, 100%. The $$$ in your pocket has no emotions, but you do. Lots.  :-)

SLAM above that Ichymoku Cloud, I'm in 100%. The factory my have burnt down, orders are less than 0, and the CEO is in jail for murdering his partner.

I'm in 100% if we are above ""The Icymoku.""  :-)
\*\*\* You need to have 500.00 sitting in your acct to unlock real-time quotes
not day trading....  Swing trading yes....
WeBull is meh.  No where near what you need to day trade.  TD Ameritrade.......or if you want in and out at break neck speed look into ""Lightspeed""  That broker is offshore and has direct access routing.....
Way to go trying to turn something into a literal statement that it clearly was not intended to be.
Pussy /s lol
Okay based of your original comment I know you haven’t day traded or swing trades long. Good luck!
Been swing trading for 10 years and I consistently buy within 30 days and then end up in the green. Remember you are just adding you loss to the base price. If the stocks takes off you still make money. Forget wash loss if you think you’re going up.
Don’t wash sales carry over into the cost basis of the next trade?
precisely!  You want to start HUGE!!!!  all your savings and maybe take out a couple loans too!  GO BIG OR GO HOME Amirite?

&#x200B;

for those not sure I am completely joking.  The opposite of what I said is the truth.  Start SMOL!
lmao, spit a wee bit of coffee out there.
You have a point.  I'm over here puking up CCIV losses.
""Never"" is a bit of a stretch. Not all profitable traders even started out paper trading. Nothing is absolute.

Also, you'll still make technical mistakes when you start trading with real money due to emotions and nerves. You'd probably make more mistakes because of them, tbh. Platforms also have some nuances you'll need to also learn once you switch from paper trading to live trading.

I'd also argue that people spend too much time learning platforms than learning how to trade, which you only really fully grasp when you trade with cash. Traders also switch platforms or use multiple platforms all the time—are you going to paper trade every time you use a new platform or force yourself to pick it up quickly by using real money?

Another argument is that most beginners don't have the funds that paper trading offers. There's definitely a psychological and strategical shift when you're trading with $100K vs. $10K vs. $1K. 

I'm not saying paper trading is bad, but people tend to ""practice"" on it for far too long. If people choose to paper trade, I say practice for a week, two weeks max. You'd lose more money not grasping the psychology of trading using real money than you would with technical mistakes on a platform.
What platform do you paper trade on?
exactly
Paper trading isn’t for everyone though, Better to start small with real money and see how it plays out, You could get over confident with paper money and lose your shit while actually trading with real money.

It’s not a rocket science always and it doesn’t take years of paper trading to start trading, You could start small and learn .
where do you paper trade? i'm trying to findnone
Whole heartedly agree. Also understanding how the platform purchases and market types and why your order might not fill on a punch error
Use a cash account and divide your funds into two days. Say you have $500. Use $250 to trade as much as you want on Monday, $250 on Tuesday. The $250 from Monday should be settled by Wednesday so you can keep trading, $250 from Tuesday should be settled by Thursday and so on.

If you have smaller funds just make smaller trades. The idea is to get used to trading with real money without the limitations of the PDT rule.
If you use a cash account it isn’t as big of a problem. You do have to wait a couple of days for the cash to settle but if you’re trading a $5 or $10 stock you can make quite a few trades with only a couple hundred in your account.

The PDT rule is a huge pain in the ass though and there’s a good argument that it lost me more money than saved as I learned.
Yeah, but if you have $25k in an account that doesn’t mean you have to use all $25k. Throw $26k in an account and pretend that $25k is “0” and only trade with money you have over that point.

You can still treat those funds as your emergency account “or whatever”, you simply have to have the discipline to not touch it.
I agree with what you’re saying. Paper trading gives you all upside potential, and zero risk. You want to know how to get past that in real money? Convince yourself you’ll loose 100% of your day trading bankroll. Let’s face it, a lot of people do. If I’m trading with $500, I convince myself I started with 5 or 10 times that amount. Too many people play with money they can’t afford to burn. Trade with only what you could afford to douse in gasoline and set ablaze. It doesn’t matter if that’s $100 or $100,000. If someone held you down and set it on fire, what could you stomach without harming your weekly / monthly / yearly budgeted expenses?

That’s when you gain clarity in real money trading — when you’re trading money that doesn’t make a difference if you burn it. A buddy of mine is a millionaire with a six figure pay check. His average daily play is $2500-$3000. He keeps about $9k circulating so he can jump on when a play emerges. Burning $9k would be painful, but he wouldn’t have to make a late payment or even skip a latte.
Yeah im not gonna do live trading until after I have a more rigid strategy and success with ondemand trading in TOS in different years of testing (like 2014, 16, 18, 20). Maybe ill do some small account stuff live.
How are you day trading with less than $500 in your account?
I started out with TOS paper money as well and wanted real time quotes but then I asked myself: why would I care if there's a 20min delay? It still works the same way. The most important part is learning all the terms and how everything works and what it does. 

I also have to say their customer support is always available for any type of questions.
It allows virtually unlimited customization, I've had no problem day trading with it, certainly a lot better than tradingview.
i use it for daytrading and its perfect , in UK so have to execute on T212. cant be arsed paying millions for lightspeed commissions etc etc
I'm not taking it literally, it is a comment on the primitivity of the statement.  Trading is not gambling only when you do research into the fundamentals behind each financial instrument. Obviously, you can do this with fake money just as well as with real money.
Lol ok
Wash sale only relates to the minimum time you can hold a security so you can claim the loss. Buy today at $5 and sell tomorrow at $4. That's a wash sale and can't claim the loss. It doesn't affect the cost basis of the next trade. I don't imagine there's anyone on the planet that'll day trade different tax lots within their position, so no.
I’ve thought about taking out a loan but having to pay taxes and also interest is double fucking myself.

Actually cciv was $12 so I would have five folded.... hm
Didn't get out above 40?
I’m currently learning to trade more quickly. I’ve been a long term trader for decades. The hardest psychological aspect is fighting the urge to hold something for a year. I got suckered into GME, but it got me started and I didn’t sink everything. A painful amount, but I’ve only lost 20% of my experimental fund. 

I just feel like I have to go through all of the “firsts” before I’ll get the hang of it. I’m a startup software engineer veteran so I’m used to trial by fire. I thank you folks for the informative insights a couple times a day.
Agree, I didn't mean you have to paper trade to be profitable, I mean paper trading is easier. So if you can't be profitable paper trading, it is very unlikely you will be with real cash. Certainly can start with cash only. I started with small cash positions. I'm technically positive because I was very conservative. Switched to paper to actually practice.
Not OP, but I use Webull
Sterling, warrior pro
I'm over doing paper trading. Warrior pro comes with 3 months using sterling trader. That's good if you'll use DAS trader/sterling/light speed in the future. Since, I'm not going likely use a lightspeed yet until I can show I could use the extra speed and I won't renew the sim fee when the 90 days runs out, I also have been using Think or swim paper trading and Tradestation sim account. I had access to think or swim because I already had a TD ameritrade account. I added tradestation because it ties into Tradingview and happened to have a free sim. I've started live trading small sizes in tradestation. Both TDameritrade and tradestation sim acts just like their main software so both are good choices depending on which broker you'll use for real
Lol you NEED to have that extra 25k laying around first. That's step 1.
I'm not.  I wanted to practice with TOS paper money.....contacted them to unlock real time quotes and they said you must have 500.00 in your acct to unlock real time quotes...

w/o 500.00 liquid....you get the 20 min delay quotes...
You're right of all the platforms TOS had me fill out SOOO much info to verify who I am not just a cell phone number and a pin ala webull

TOS is the mature trading platform hands down.  I just researched daytrading and one of the things that can give you an edge is direct access routing.

Lightspeed can do that.  But I will admit I love TOS!
um....yes but when you're looking to get in and out with like 40k shares in seconds.....TD Ameritrade might have an issue I'm not sure if their holding company is APEX or not....I KNOW WeBull is....

This guy convinced me an hesitating w daytrading in TOS:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4XZ\_67c0Fo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4XZ_67c0Fo)
Yeah.....lightspeed is like 1200/mo!!  rediculous.....BUUUT it is SO FAST....so if you pay for it.....you can make money faster.....

Ross said....if you can be profitable w TD Ameritrade....your earning will be amplified wi lightspeed...
Only if you held and sold at the proper times.
bought at 55.00 LOL  I 2was looking long term...(Hoping that like Tesla it would explode) 

Looks like Wallstreet decided as the merger announcement....= -40%  haha um ok
Swing trading vs. day trading. Swing trading is much more doable with a fulltime job and easy to apply with the right strategy and patience.
Right, it's a different strategy, like day trading vs. swing trading. I, too, struggle with wanting to hold long term and often have to remind myself to stick to the plan—get in, profit, get out; don't chase, don't be greedy and fight the FOMO. You're totally right about going through all the ""firsts"" first, but you'll totally get the hang of it. Looks like you have the right mindset!
>paper trading is easier 

Which is why people should do it minimally or skip it altogether. 

>if you can’t be profitable paper trading, it is very unlikely you will be with real cash

By what standards? It’s mostly emotions and trade psychology that prevents people from making money trading. You get neither with paper trading. 

The reasons why people aren’t profitable day trading aren’t necessarily the same reasons why they wouldn’t be profitable live trading.
Can you paper trade options in webull?
Did you know webull is owned by China
He seems sooo, something to me. I just don’t get it, let’s say you really could turn 500 bucks into millions in a few years, why would you charge that much money to people just starting out? I’m not accusing the guy of being a straight up sociopath but it wouldn’t surprise me.

Did you get that much value out of your course?!
Sure, I’m just saying that if you have it you don’t *need* to use it. I have more have more than $25k sitting in my emergency fund, built up from when I had a day job. I can still treat that money as untouchable while it sits in a brokerage account.
Oh well. I didn't know they did that for paper trading. My mistake I guess.
Bro, if that’s the case, INTRA-DAY TRADING. It will teach you the fundamentals and skills needed

I’d probably still be holding
Not a mistake I'll make again...Chasing IPO failed......chasing a merger announcement netted a loss.  

So I'll just play penny stonks
Many things in the market are “buy the rumor, sell the news”.

People bought CCIV on the rumor of it merging with Lucid, bought it from 15 all the way to 60, this is a crazy valuation! So of course it should sell off when the news is released as it had already been over valued.
All dude means is it’s a safe way to practice essential skills without risking real money. Sure, you don’t absolutely 100% need to paper trade before using the actual stock market. But, if you have no idea what you’re doing, you’re likely to lose a lot before you win. So the idea is people go to paper trading to get those mistakes out of the way, and learn from them, then go into the real thing ready to go ... or at least more ‘ready’ than before.
I plan on a month or 2 of paper. Learning new techniques. Actively trading otherwise with money. Not sure what minimal would be. I think a day or 2 to learn software is minimal and reasonable if you know what you're doing. 

There are no standards. Just that most people day trading for real, fail and can blow up an account. I'm no expert, definitely open to other techniques on learning while maximizing chance for success. What's your recommendations?
I’m not sure about options
Yeah, I don’t have any money in it, I just used it to get use to the charts and everything
Who the fuck downvoted you? You’re right. 

WeBull *is* owned by China. If that doesn’t concern people.. it should.
I'm partially through it. I think his advertising persona is different than his teaching persona. Very believable and genuine. I don't think it's necessary. Free courses, youtube, books can get you the same info. It's very well organized and recorded which keeps me from going down rabbit holes. If I did it on my own, I would be all over the place. Access to the sim, chatroom and scanners is helpful but also with viable free or cheaper alternatives. He's built up a very good company. The lecture software is high quality, the chatroom is also high quality, much better than discord. I think the reason he does it to put my guess in the mix is that he truly enjoys teaching, he didn't always make that much money. I think he has a passion for teaching. He made good amount but not millions until last year. It's good to diversify your income stream. So far, I'm happy. I've made more on my own trading and options, but I've also lost more in dumb trades so I figured it could be money well spent.
it's sooo hard not to look at current prices and grow your account.....
You solution is more volatility?
Look into VNUE and UBMRF.
>All dude means

Are we reading the same post? Dude said:

>if you can't make money in paper trading then you'll never make it with real money.

and

>if you can't be profitable paper trading, it is very unlikely you will be with real cash.

I don't have a problem with paper trading to practice essential skills (but don't stay there for too long). My issue was their sweeping statements basically claiming that one's success with paper trading is indicative of one's success live trading. Two different beasts.

>without risking real money

That's the inherent problem with paper trading. You can practice all the essential skills you want, but without risking real money you're not practicing those skills in the right context.

>the idea is people go to paper trading to get those mistakes out of the way, and learn from them

Real life: people don't get mistakes out of the way and truly learn from them until there are real consequences.

Paper trading just teaches you about mistakes that exist and ones you're prone to make. But without actual emotions and real money, that's all they are. 

Unfortunately you have to lose money to learn lessons. Most traders have that one or two defining trades when losing real money was the pivotal moment that defines how much better they are as traders today.
Do what you think will work best for you, but IMO beginners should paper trade just to learn the software or app and make a few trades for a week or so. And then get out there with real money, even if it's not a lot. Start with $100 if you have to, just go small. Use a cash account so you can trade unlimited while learning how to manage your funds. The idea is to learn trading psychology with real money—when real emotions and the worst in you come out.

>Learning new techniques

You can learn techniques anywhere. Tradimo is a great place with lessons in small chunks and quizzes after each one. YouTube is a great place for learning techniques as well. You can also follow live traders and how they trade. 

>most people day trading for real, fail and can blow up an account

""Most people"" includes people who have spent months or even a year paper trading. This has less to do with knowing how to trade and more to do with knowing how to handle your emotions when getting in and out of trades because real money is at stake.
Nice man glad you’re getting value out of it
fire with fire!!!!
Paper trading is like the training wheels of trading. If someone is consistently eating shit on their bike with training wheels, what makes you think they won't do the same thing on a real bike?

It doesn't mean you have to use training wheels to learn how to ride a bike.
Thanks, appreciate your perspective.
fight fire with fire sale 🔥
You're proving my point. If someone is consistently eating shit on their bike with training wheels, it's not an indication that they will do the same thing on a bike without training wheels. 

Eating shit on training wheels happens for different reasons than eating shit on a bike—training wheels aren't meant to teach you how to ride a bike or not eat shit while riding one. Most people don't understand what training wheels are for, just as most new traders don't understand what paper trading is for. (And that's okay.)

It's the same with paper trading. Consistently losing money while paper trading is not an indication that you will consistently lose money live trading because they happen for different reasons. There are different mechanics at play as I've detailed previously in this thread.

What are the Most Interesting Projects Uniquely Enabled by Crypto?,109.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/nluv1w/what_are_the_most_interesting_projects_uniquely/,"From the top of my head (which may be in the clouds—I am not a blockchain engineer): 

Make digital items more tangible. NFTs allow a digital copy to behave more like a physical one. For instance, a video game could be uniquely tied to your purchase, and you could re-sell that very copy to someone else. In fact, by combining various different blockchain projects, the entire process of purchasing, downloading, and re-selling your copy of a video game could be done entirely without any monetized distribution platform. 

Storing information on a blockchain makes it virtually impossible to tamper with and to remove (unless agreed upon criteria are met, probably). You could have your certificates stored and signed by an issuer on a blockchain, and never have to worry about having its legitimacy or origin be questioned, have its integrity broken, or even losing the data.

Trustless trade in general. You can replace the broker in most trades with a blockchain.
One of my favourites is fairly ignored/unknown in the crypto space, because it has no ""coin"" attached to it, so it isn't tractable for speculative mania: [RedGrid](https://redgrid.io/).

It uses Holochain to allow energy devices (e.g., solar panels, and any appliance that uses energy) to communicate and coordinate energy use, which is needed in order to address the problem of variable energy availability from renewables.

Edit: Pleasantly surprised to see this get top comment! If you are interested in learning how to develop on Holochain, they have a free devcamp coming up next month: [https://forum.holochain.org/t/devcamp8-announcement/5879](https://forum.holochain.org/t/devcamp8-announcement/5879)
Brave Browser and subsequently BAT token
Helium network is a good one.

Hotspots provide lora radio coverage that sends and recieve packets of data from IOT devices.  Helium network token are rewarded to Hotspot owners for providing proof of coverage.  Helium is sold and burnt into data credits, the IOT owners need to buy data credits so they can use the network
The Reserve Protocol allows people un Venezuela/Argentina to automatically exchange between dollars (RSV stablecoin) and their local currency. The project even supports withdrawing and depositing from a local currency account! 

This is big. Imagine PayPal but crypto and with full support of latin american countries. I think they're planning to open the app on Lebanon and other high inflation countries.
I think the first project you need to look into is Monero. It’s like bitcoin but with special modifications to make it private, untraceable, digital money; it has a use case that will always be in demand and is uniquely enabled by cryptography and blockchain.

Second project, a bitcoin code fork, Ravencoin. It allows you to issue out your own security tokens on the blockchain. It can be useful for entrepreneurs and SMEs (small/medium sized enterprises) to access a larger audience to raise capital.

Third, I’d dig deeper into the top Ethereum projects, especially the top DeFi projects like Uniswap, Maker, Aave, Chainlink.
if you want to understand how blockchain works with regular cryptocurrencies you see on coinmarket cap. check out mastering bitcoin. i recommend the paperback but the book is on their github for free. it also has some code examples in full from the book https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook. 

The other aspect is about understanding the use cases. what does blockchain solve, over using a centralised system ? when its appropriate to use? which the book doesnt really cover 

for that id recommend reading this paper:

[Do you need a Blockchain?](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/375.pdf)
My current favorite project is working on a decentralized database that enables decentralized social networks and other decentralized applications. This part of the project isn’t supposed to be commercial, but on the other hand it has a clearing house to generate income. 

While I’m looking forward towards its commercial success on the clearing house, I would really love for the decentralized social networks to become a success. 

A decentralized database will essentially allow the users to own their own data, and choose to sell it to advertisers or lock it. The power that social networks and any other enterprise that extracts users’ data is great, and they are not trustworthy to handle it. Many thinkers believe that data will be the new oil, and I agree to a degree. If we become a commodity and can be easily manipulated by anyone who owns our data, that will make this world really dystopian and scary.

I think that given the decentralized nature of this blockchain, people can get the power back. This blockchain can handle many more services such as music or movie streaming, e-commerce, and many other applications. If it becomes a success, and people start using it for most of their services, it could force companies to use it as well. If that happens, the power of data will mo longer be held by a tiny amount of individuals in Silicon Valley or somewhere else. It will be in the hands of the people, and we will not be heading towards the dystopian future we currently are.

The use-case most unique to crypto that, as you mentioned, isn't sexy is cross-border payments. Its amazing how far things have strayed from this to the point where no one in here has even mentioned it; its literally the core purpose of crypto.

Why is it unique to blockchain? To answer I'll simply propose a scenario. 

You live in the US with a family member overseas, say Nigeria. Your family member needs money. You decide to sell from your investment fund to send the money to your family member. 

How long does that take?

Well, depending on the investment, itll likely take 2 days for your sales to settle. Once those settle you may need to withdraw from your investment account to your bank which would likely take another 2 days. Then you may need to transfer those to family members account. Then your family member would need to find a place to convert USD to Naira. That's, what, 7+ busines days with potentially 5 layers of fees just to send someone money?

How long could that take with blockchain?

Potentially less than a minute. Sell from fund, 5 second settlement. Send directly to family members wallet where funds are auto exchanged from USD to Naira. Done.

I like the idea of controlling the secondary ticket market. For example you could program into the contract that if a ticket gets resold the original issuer gets 50%, or that it can't be resold for a higher price at all.

https://get-protocol.io/ is what I found when researching this use case.
Defi, NFTs, supply chain traceability and provenance. You can do some of the same functionality with out the blockchain but you can do most things without blockchain, just not as well or as trustlessly. 

Then you can start to mix these things together - tokenize assets and free up value by using as security on defi, for example.
I have this question as well.

So far, all the answers I see are not unique. They are things you can already do with a centralized system, P2P, or a normal distributed system. Blockchain isn't the only way to run a distributed system.

I think zero proof financial transactions might be one of the few unique things for cryptocurrency. (Edit: Never mind. Even that can be done centralized)
Haven’t read all the comments but flash loans are something blockchain enables allowing you to loan tokens to anybody with no collateral and they go and make arbitrage trades, pay you back plus profit and they also make a profit all in one transaction without the risk of not being repayed. While you certainly don’t NEED blockchain for this...I just don’t think anybody would loan a random person on the internet money without collateral unless every person on the internet was 100% honest 100% of the time. Blockchain enables very interesting ways to lend and borrow through defi smart contracts essentially.
Decentralized finance is a given now in the crypto world but 5 years before now it was almost non existant. This is already huge and can't wait to see what the future hold.
Look up Maidsafe (Crypto: MAID) web: [safenetforum.org](https://safenetforum.org)

They've been plugging at this since before bitcoin, just getting into the final product testnets.  It replaces several layers of the web stack, and is not blockchain based but includes state of the art crypto.  Essentially a fully encrypted permanent web.. the basics are full encryption and redundant storage of data with granular permissions, Byzantine fault tolerant CRDT data structures, AT2 transactions.   You can save data, host websites, build web apps, use completely private email etc.  Instant, private, scalable transactions.

Because the research/engineering has taken so long, many have written it off (or never even heard of it), but it is right at the finish line now. Worth a deep dive.
I'm biased since I'm the developer, but using Nano, PlayNANO offers a multiplayer provably fair roulette (gambling) that requires no login.

It's provably fair, meaning all spins are fair. Not the user nor the server (PlayNANO) can predict the outcome of any spin until the roulette stops spinning.

It's also multiplayer, as in, you can see other players betting, and the spins are the same for everyone playing. Your bets actually affect the outcome of the spin.

Lastly, by using Nano, an instant and feeless Cryptocurrency, you have one of the best user experience one can have. You just have to place your bet, scan the QR code to send Nano, and wait for the round to end and then if you win you're also paid instantly. No login required.

Check out the Bankless podcast for some truly amazing talks about Defi and the practical uses of crypto. 

Some unique projects I think are awesome:

Pooltogether is a fascinating concept that can only be practically done on a blockchain. It's a Lossless Lottery where everyone pools their assets, the pool earns an interest rate, and then the interest earned is awarded out in a lottery. Code is audited and public so you can see that it's truly random and fair.

A new one I'm researching is Alchemix. The concept is that you deposit a stablecoin and then borrow against that stablecoin. It uses interest rate arbitrage to pay the loan off automatically. It also has the feature of extremely low risk of liquidation.
Algorand and their CBDCs and how governments and orgs can utilise their blockchain.

Cool stuff.
Lokinet, a better sybil resistant onion routing network like Tor. It used incentified service nodes instead of nodes based on altruizm. The team also built Session, a messenger that onion routes messages to achieve network privacy.

Intried both, the tech is quite amazing as is the codebase.
I focus almost solely on the project use cases when making investment decisions rather than hype coins, and I have a few at the top of my list:

- VeChain: supply-chain management platform built around blockchain technology. They can place RFID trackers on physical assets throughout production so when you find them at a retailer you can scan a QR code on your phone and learn about the product from start to finish. Imagine buying produce and being able to see information about the organic growth conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.). They’re doing it with wine too, from the planted seeds all the way through the bottling process. Or imagine buying clothes and being able to check that it is not counterfeit with a quick QR scan. The beauty of the blockchain is that it’s self-auditing and uneditable. They are also working to track carbon capture in China on top of some other uses.

- Basic Attention Token (BAT): You can download the Brave browser on your computer or phone, which comes with a built-in ad-blocker. Instead of normal webpage ads, you’re given Brave ads (you can disable or customize the number of ads you receive up to 5/hour) and are rewarded in a small amount of BAT for viewing them, hence the name “basic attention token”. You’re also able to tip BAT to content creators that have enabled BAT tipping and can schedule those tips monthly.

- Helium: Helium is mined via radio waves on hotspots owned by users for providing proof of coverage. These hotspots create an IOT network, and Helium is burned into data credits that IOT owners need to buy in order to use the network. The returns on the hotspots are INSANE right now (up to $1000+/month in urban areas). The logic is that compared to a network company like AT&T which pays employees to install and manage the network, the users are paid out in Helium to install and manage the network and provides incentive to mine and contribute to nationwide/global proof of coverage for the network.

I do not claim to be a genius on any of these technologies, so if anyone has corrections or added comments please feel free to correct me here.

I am interested in new projects, but where can I find information about them?
For me, the best part about crypto/blockchain are the projects that utilize it to establish trust and tamper-proof scenarios. So, there are projects that help you prove certain conditions are met, like I really was there at the concert and the blockchain can prove it. Better yet, blockchain technology could set up a smart contract that pays me because I was at a concert in person.
I’ve felt that r/stacks is basically already ETH 2.0. Has limitless scalability, multiple apps, smart/active dev team, and a good foundation for web3. If the time comes where people can host their own full customizable sites on blockchain with integrated automated financial protocols/contracts then I see a lot of potential.
Non Custodial Financial Services.

It's a feature of UTXO blockchains (so more like Bitcoin and less like Ethereum, which has an account model). 

Basically, you can provide some financial services without ever taking custody of funds. One practical example in production is Blind Escrow used by local.bitcoin.com. 

This is enabled by the check data sig OP, that has been added to BCH somehwere in 2018-2019.

When I was introduced to crypto, recording data in an unalterable way wad by far the most important use case all. The coin or tokens seemed like a lure that would draw the average person to it. Human greed is tangible and calculable. 

Crypto is the future of commerce. It needs tokens and coins to get us to use it. Immutable record keeping, fruitless transactions, and On chain transparency is needed and will succeed. Jmho
> Trustless trade in general. You can replace the broker in most trades with a blockchain.

I never really understood this use case so perhaps you could help me get it.

How does the smart contract (/blockchain) “know” when the conditions have been made in order to execute the trade? Wouldn’t you need a third party to confirm and input this information?
> For instance, a video game could be uniquely tied to your purchase, and you could re-sell that very copy to someone else.

This would be a positive DRM solution.  You can't share your private key, because the person you share with could sell it and invalidate your license.  But you can still install on all your devices.  Buyer having full resale rights means essentially rental/try options.  MSFT could for example rebuy ""used"" licenses to keep price up.
These aren't unique. They are just decentralized versions of doing things that centralized systems already do.

You can sell digital goods on many game trading platforms.

Public key certificate is the centralized version of the certificate topic. If you're just talking about key exchange, that's existed decades before Bitcoin. Cryptography is not cryptocurrency-specific.

So it really depends on which question OP means:

1. What can only be done with crypto?
1. What can only be done with crypto, but decentralized?

The 2nd is a slippery slope that has tautology issues. Almost everything could fall under the 2nd as a use case.
I couldn't find out how they leveraged blockchain to provide their service. They mention AI and IoT but neither require blockchain to operate. Could you enlighten me please?
Why does it need a Blockchain and not just a database?
Definitely an area I know nothing about. Will look into it. Thanks!
You can also do this centralized, so I don't consider it unique.
Will look more into it. I do personally think one of the most apparent problems in the world is the transfer of money, so I am particularly interested here
>on Monero

Censorship is one thing blockchain stands against by deploying its Decentralised nature and leveraging on such [technology](http://twitter.com/railgun_project) while utilizing the various DeFi Legos on chain is a big plus.

Doesn't really need crypto/blockchain, does it?  


Any centralized platform could track who the original owner of an item was and give them a cut of all future sales. Which from an end-user perspective would look the same, I think?  


Obviously, this ignores the whole ""trustless"" aspect, which I am personally bearish on (but learning more about!). I'm still not yet convinced that end-users don't actually like having a centralized party they can trust, but that is a separate topic
I think the biggest reason I am bearish on most projects is I simply don’t think most people care about “trustless” and privacy. They want the fastest, most convenient, and most affordable way to solve their problem.

I also acknowledge this is probably a very first world way of looking at things
Anything in particular I should look at?
Sweet. Added to list.

My initial skepticism is just that nobody (or only a tiny fraction of people) actually cares about privacy. Most just want stuff that works the best and younger generations increasingly don't care at all. Nobody is switching to a private internet with less functionality or a private social network that has no one else on it.

Will update with how my opinions have shifted after reading!  


\*Editing to add that this is clearly a very first world viewpoint\*
You stated that they were working on this before bitcoin. You can still do this without crypto, so it's not unique.
My biggest skepticism here is that I am not yet convinced that the population of people that care about something being ""provably fair"" is particularly large. Though could see how this increases in importance the more amount you are gambling.  


Will look into it more and update with how my opinions have changed!
Someone else recommended Bankless so I downloaded some!  


Pooltogether doesn't really seem uniquely enabled by blockchain. Prize-linked savings accounts are this exact thing, right?  


Will look into Alchemix! Thanks!
Will look more into these! Leaving my initial skepticism below so I can report back later with how my mind has changed.  


Vechain. I don't see why you really need a blockchain for this. Companies aren't incentivized to lie about their production practices because they would get fined by governments and you can easily state how a product was produced without a blockchain. Also, I just don't think very many end-consumers really care.  


BAT. The idea of getting paid to view ads is interesting, but if the CPMs are anything like what I've seen in my time in the consumer space, you are literally getting paid fractions of a penny to view ads which no one would care about. My own personal belief is just that very few people actually care about privacy (especially younger people)  


Helium. I do actually think this is uniquely enabled by blockchain and very cool. The next questions I need to answer for myself are: is there actually a coverage issue for IOT devices that needs solved, is this the best way to solve it, and what needs to happen for IOT devices to connect to Helium network instead of whatever is out there already.  


Great recommendations. Will look into them and update my opinions
Why wouldn't it be possible on Ethereum? I don't see the problem with an escrow smart contract.
Surprised you haven't got a straightforward answer yet. The answer is oracles (e.g. LINK, BAND). And they themselves use several decentralised sources that must arrive at consensus in order to verify some fact external to the blockchain. :)
I imagine that's up to individual situations. If I have a signed asset I want to sell to you, we would set up a trade so that it happens automatically once that very asset is committed for trade by me, and you have committed the agreed-upon payment. The ""third party"" is the people validating the integrity and state of the blockchain.

Exactly what the conditions are would be up to us. I imagine niche platforms will establish and prepare common conditions for their typical trades.
>Wouldn’t you need a third party to confirm and input this information?

Smart contracts automate blockchain activity.  Where ever blockchain activity interfaces with the real world then an agent in the real world must *attest* that a condition of a smart contract has been met.  See the [Tim Ferris interview with Nick Szabo](https://tim.blog/2018/06/01/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-nick-szabo/), search for ""inherently wet"".
Smart contracts are just code that lives on the block chain. So smart contracts are the ""third party"" of those transactions. The thing with smart contracts is that they are immutable, once they are deployed to a blockchain they can not be edited, so the creator has to get it right. Developers can view the code for smart contracts to verify the security and validity of the smart contract. But ultimately that smart contract is a bit of code that ""knows"" when conditions are met and executes trades accordingly, getting rid of the need for a legit third party to facilitate that transaction.
Developers would have less than no incentive for implementing anything like this though. Why would they want to decimate their own market just to enable easy reselling of their products through NFTs?
Reselling digital goods? Proving without a doubt the integrity of data? No, those aren't possible. That's like arguing e-mail wasn't something new because regular mail already existed. For many products and services, becoming decentralized will is what will take them to the next level.
They don't use blockchain, actually. They use Holochain, which is more of a general purpose app framework for distributed networks (i.e., energy devices are by nature distributed nodes, so Holochain is ideal for it).

I'm not sure I'd be able to explain it adequately, but you can ask them in [their Telegram channel](https://t.me/redgrid). They're very friendly and the Telegram has fewer than 200 people, so it's pretty chill. You can also try googling ""redgrid holochain"" and you may find some info. This is an article that I just found that seems to have some info: [https://blog.holochain.org/building-together-redgrids-internet-of-energy-mission-and-the-holochain-community/](https://blog.holochain.org/building-together-redgrids-internet-of-energy-mission-and-the-holochain-community/)
I don't know about this project but Holochain despite the name is not a blockchain.

A regular database has a owner (for example imagine facebook) which may do what he wants with your data (even not allowing you to see what data they have about you), using holochain you have much more control over your data.
Upon basically 30 minutes of research, I do agree that this is actually something uniquely enabled by crypto.  


My open questions are whether IOT actually has a coverage issue that needs to be solved, if this is actually the best way to solve it if so, and what is required for IOT devices to connect to the Helium network.  


Will continue diving
You can, but no one has - the problem with centralisation is there has been no inventisation for the network to be built out.  Amazon sidewalk might kibosh helium, there's always rivals with everything but nothing comes closer to what helium has achieved in just under two years.
I've used stellar xlm for international transfer before and the fees plus exchange spread made it pretty expensive.

I don't know whose fault it is but the system is faster but not inexpensive yet.
What blockchain is that running on? There's probably a million competitors in that space, atm.
Yeah, you're right, it could be done centralized. 
For me the value in most blockchain applications is eliminating the middlemen and not having to pay someone just so I have a party to interact with that I can trust. With this I can be 100% confident that the I will receive the ticket I paid for and am the sole owner of it, which I'm currently not when interacting with secondary ticket markets.
Perhaps Defi Loans and Smart Contracts to name two
You can't do this without cryptocurrency techniques.   Aside from the fact that AT2 is a very recent cryptocurrency algorithm, Byzantine tolerant replication of data and agreement of network state is at the very heart of what crypto currency does.
That's true, not that many people care about provably fair. But in this case, that's not really where crypto makes it unique.

I mean you asked for things that can only be accomplished with crypto, and provably fair can be achieved without crypto (although it uses crypto on this case).

The ""unique"" thing here is not requiring a login. I don't need anything from the user, no data, except their address/transaction.

I also offer Gift Cards users can purchase, again, with no Login. Not sure that would be possible to make without crypto.

Also not possible to make with Bitcoin for example, due to the fees and how long transactions take, but yeah you get my point. Just giving you an example of what's possible, like you asked. Much more is possible, especially if you use an instant and feeless crypto.
> Vechain. I don't see why you really need a blockchain for this. Companies aren't incentivized to lie about their production practices because they would get fined by governments and you can easily state how a product was produced without a blockchain. Also, I just don't think very many end-consumers really care.

Supply chain verification is not just an end user issue, although it is beneficial for them as well. Finding the source of counterfeit introduction into the supply chain, or precise extraction of a tainted batch are just two great use cases. Beyond that, using blockchain is cheaper and much more secure. Additionally, each party, seller, buyer, and transporter can use the blockchain to verify the integrity of the product without having to expose their various private databases to others. Supply chain is one of my favorite use cases.
Curious if you have any updated thoughts after some further research; my opinions are always open to new knowledge and ideas!
To the best of my understanding, the escrow would still take custody of the funds in some way (and so, be labelled as a money transmitter, and be subject to regulation etc). 

I believe *blind* escrow is not possible on Eth (but am open to be corrected)
[removed]
Not trying to be obtuse but wouldn’t you need a third party to facilitate you “committing” your asset for the trade? Unless you’re trading bitcoins for bitcoin (or whatever the on chain currency is).
Licenses could last 1-5 years so as to have declining value.  They would have more buyers,users if lower cost due to resell potential.
Steam is a huge platform for trading digital goods (remember hats?). Kids were selling/buying Diablo 2 items decades ago.

All done through centralized systems or P2P systems.

Also, NFT does not solve the issue of 1-to-1 transactions. I can create an infinite amount of NFTs on different platforms pointing to the same good.
Thanks for the info, I'll definitely be asking. Seems like a great project.
Ok you made me look a bit into holochain, thanks it seems interesting. However, my observation was just that I don't really see why that project needs a blockchain. From what I read this just let you coordinate some devices in your house, so a database should be enough, I may be wrong though.

If I am the owner of the database and/or the data is encrypted I have nearly no problem.  Using a Blockchain where it's not needed increases the complexity for nothing and you also loose performance.
This is probably one of the few cases where it's more efficient and secure to do via crypto, but you can totally do this via a normal distributed system without crypto.

In fact, almost every example in this thread can be done via a centralized system, P2P, or a distributed system. So they aren't unique.

Fair enough. Definitely think cost savings would be a legitimate benefit
BFT has been used in aviation years before cryptocurrencies. That's actually one of the things you learn in crypto classes.

Fault tolerance in general is used everywhere. BFT is just a specific category of it.
Appreciate your discussion, I too prioritize use cases when investing and was literally researching VET just now and stumbled in here.
Well said and entirely agreed. VeChain is honestly top of my list, I’ve been recommending people to check it out since I dove into the project in 2017 and bought in at the ICO.

The potential uses related to supply-chain are endless too—they can extend into healthcare, automobile manufacturing and reporting, carbon emission tracking as I noted, etc. Can you imagine a blockchain-backed carfax report that you can access with a quick QR scan?
Very interesting. Will need to learn more
Haven't gotten to VeChain yet! It's on my list though. Been reading mostly DeFi stuff so far.   


The core concept behind Helium of individuals providing value to a network and then getting to reap the rewards of that value instead of some centralized company providing and collecting all the value is very interesting. I am not bullish on Helium as I think IOT is not the proper application of this, but that underlying concept is super interesting.
Hm, interesting. I wonder for a long time already if smart contracts can be regulated (instead of the Interactions with one).
But indeed, if the capital would be send to the smart contract upfront, it would have custody over it.
An alternative would be to just authorize the escrow contract to deduct up to x tokens from your balance. That way the sender holds custody of the tokens while the escrow contract is allowed to send it another way when I is triggered.
A downside would be that the other party can't be sure there will be enough tokens available when the payment is due. I guess that's exactly the benefit of UTXOs then?
Interesting. Which oracle(s) is this true for?
You wouldn't. It's preprogrammed in the smart contracts, thus making it trustless, no third parties required
I think people are missing your point here, but I get what you're asking. 

The onus is on the person selling the item to be accurate about it, but they won't want to scam themselves.

For example if I had an NFT for my car, and someone wanted to buy my car, then I'd transfer ownership of the car to them manually in exchange for money, like transferring the title of a car. 

But yeah it's not automatic.
So if you are trading something that is not digital, say Real estate, there needs to be some way to get the information required by the smart contract in order for the smart contract to execute. There are ways to do this that do require a 3rd party, and ways that don't. 


Ex 1. We make a smart contract where I pay you $100,000 when and if I recieve the title to the real estate. The smart contract can automatically transfer the $100k as soon as it gets the signal, but there needs to be some input. We cannot trust the seller to input the signal, because they have incentive to input the signal before the transfer. We cannot trust the buyer to input the signal becauae they have incentive to never input the signal. So it requires some 3rd party verification of the signal (since the signal is inherently non-digital).


However, we could write the contract as:


Ex 2: When I send you $100k, the real estate deed is automatically signed and released to the buyer which transfers the property. In this case, the smart contract CAN see the movement of cash if we use public wallets. Legally, it would be a little complicated, but we can put the contract itself into the blockchain, so that should work as well.


Now, while some contracts can simply be re-done slightly differently, that is not the case for many contracts, and smart contracts cannot replace everything. (for instance, there is no way to send a service such as plumbing work, over the blockchain)
No that's the point of trustless, you don't need the third party
Yeah I didn't ""defend"" that argument because I really don't know what the project does, but Holochain is promissing and if they deliver what they intend it can become something REALLY interesting.

>If I am the owner of the database and/or the data is encrypted I have nearly no problem. Using a Blockchain where it's not needed increases the complexity for nothing and you also loose performance.

Yeah that's true you add complexity but you also get advantages from it. For example if you want to share your data your own database might make it harder.

For example, a nice use case would be to sell your data directly to whoever is interested. This way there is no centralized service earning from your data, with something like this you are in control and it is easy to access these kinds of deals.
It's not just for devices in your house, it can also be used for microgrids in communities, or creating a larger ""Internet of Energy..."" not sure what that means exactly, but from what I have heard from the Redgrid team, they absolutely require Holochain to be able to do what they are doing. As I mentioned in another comment, I'd suggest asking the team yourself in their TG channel if you want to know more about why they chose Holochain and not a basic database: [https://t.me/redgrid](https://t.me/redgrid)
Agreed. I actually should’ve phrased it “what is something that crypto/blockchain does better than centralized services” instead of “...that centralized services can’t do”. But this is one of those cases. However, I have concerns about whether IOT coverage is actually an issue
I've heard pretty unfavorable feedback about using lightning. I personally think other blockchains are much better suited for that use case and some are well under way.
OK, fair point.   AT2 transactions are squarely crypto for transactions though, hosted on a decentralized p2p system..  and there's a lot more in there. 

I'm struggling a bit to find your specific objection..  I mean take Bitcoin...   RipeMD, SHA-2, ECC, none of it new.   It's the system that makes it.   Same thing here.  AES, ECC, AT2, SHA-3, multiple kinds of threshold signatures... wound up in a decentralized system that is not a blockchain, but enables a unique suite of applications that can't be replicated in its entirety without crypto... You may or may not agree with the project's value, but there is no way you can call it unrelated to what OP is looking for.
Glad to have helped provide some useful info where I can. You have good taste in blockchain projects!
[deleted]
But doesn’t someone have to verify that the smart contract is doing what you think it is? Or you would have to technically know enough to understand the smart contract.

Most lay-people probably can’t read a contract?
I think a good example is if you want to buy concert tickets via smart contract.

You could decide under what conditions the purchase is made

For example:
- if weather.com say it raines, the money stais in your wallet
- if your government forbids concerts, you keep your money
- etc.

If all the criteria are fullfilled, you get the ticket and the money is getting transfered to the artist.

You wouldn't need to do claim your money back in case of a storm or anything, no 3rd party is needed.
See my comment above, but the problem here is that the ""smart"" contract is just dumb. In some cases (sach as for a car) you could rewrite it to be smart again, but there are a lot of cases that will never work with smart contracts.

The ideal smart contract actually completes the deal when conditions are met (ie it does not rely on a third party OR the buyer OR the seller)
Could even do it more elegantly through the use of an escrow wallet, and have the escrow wallet hold both deed in form of NFT and dictated amount for the purchaser, upon expiration of escrow, both parties provide some positive input via a txn, or some other mechanism, and the deed and currency are swapped to the directed parties, upon failure to successfully transact, the escrow wallet returns NFT and currency to the original parties.

Because smart contracts can have wallets in many cases, and be programmed explicitly and transparently, these would be automated/mechanized steps that only require human interaction for confirmation, rather than the transactions themselves.

Throw a contract on a chain, give it a wallet address, have two key confirmation from two specified wallets for executing contract by X day, if wallets do not send their side of the bargain into the escrow account by execution date, it fails, if both do, they're automatically swapped and the transaction is verifiable and valid.
If you have some large number of distributed sensors (agriculture, ecology, utilities, asset tracking, etc), it's very expensive to put a SIM card in all of them and pay the telcos for service for every single sensor. It's much cheaper to put a LoRaWAN radio in them and connect to the Helium network. That's the promise, at least.

Fair to say that they probably have more coverage than active users of the network at the moment.

They're also adding 5G to their network to create a decentralized telecom network.

Very interesting project.
OP's wording of ""use cases uniquely enabled blockchain/tokes/crypto in general"" is vague, so you might be right that he's looking at technologies that were expedited by blockchain, and not ones that are solely allowed by blockchains.

Just some notes for myself from cryptography class:

- AES: Used everywhere for symmetric cryptography. Became ubiquitous with WPA2 around 2005.
- ECC: Used everywhere on the internet. It's the central backbone to public key exchange and key generation (along with RSA and DHE). Ubiquitous with HTTPS.
- SHA-3: This one is really new (2015), and I don't think it has any widespread use. Designed by NIST in a project unrelated to crypto. It was bound to happen with or without cryptocurrencies. ETH uses a SHA-3 candidate, but not the final winner.
- AT: I'm not familiar with AT2 at all. It sounds like a class of consensus algorithms designed specifically for blockchains.
Sounds like there's lots of work still to be done.
Well I guess you'd have to be technical enough to inspect and understand but it's the same as using a VPN for example, you just need to know the product is reliable and trusted but most people won't be able to verify that it's doing what it says as it's pretty complex tech.

I'm not that technical but I understand there are DAOs, decentralised autonomous organisations, which is a coded structure's that do the ""decision making"" and self governance. I'm still learning and new to all of this so trying to fully understand myself. But there is no person or entity controling it, as it's decentralised.

Well, weather.com and the government are third parties. I'm not splitting hairs, it's important to understand that anything that's not on the immutable block chain is a third party.

For something like tickets no big deal, but it's good to avoid 3rd party points of failure for expensive things
But if there is a glitch on weather.com you lose your money.. and does this even solve a real problem?
I don't follow. I mean the contract is about as dumb as if I sold someone my car title directly
Read your comment, and yep agreed, I actually thought that NFTs could already do that (automatically transfer ownership once the eth price has been met)
So the biggest problem with your solution is that it is potentially very costly.


Now are probably going to say, ""But there is no cost, its actually the lowest cost you can have!""


But in finance and accounting we deal with both monetary costs, such as paying a fee to a broker, and non-monetary costs such as oppurtunity costs.


So with that in mind lets think about the contract you presented. First lets assume that the contract is not settled immediately. In many cases of Defi, we want long term contracts, such as loans. If the contract is executed immediately, then we probably don't really have much need for blockchain except as means of transfer, which as previously discussed, blockchain may be able to provide, but it is somewhat clunky at it.


But to keep the example the same, lets say we enter into the contract that you portray above, and we have a ""closing date"" that is 30 days from the time we put assets into the contract. So we each need to accept within 30 days for the contract to execute.


What is actually happening here legally? There are a few key things:

1) The buyer loses control over his money for at least 30 days. 

2) Both parties can unilaterally cancel the contract for any reason by simply not submitting verification.

3) The seller has to wait 30 days to recieve any actual money.


This creates what we would call...""perverse incentives"". Basically, it encourages people to take actions that are bad for the other parties in the agreement. 

First, the seller knows there is X crypto in the contract. If on day 29, he sees that crypto has greatly increased in value, he accepts. On the other hand, if he sees the value of the crypto has dropped, he simply cancels the contract and re-lists the property at a better price. The seller has these same incentives, if the value of the property or crytpo has changed, they have incentives to cancel the deal. Since each party can cancel the deal unilaterally, if there is any volatility in prices, the deal is unlikely to actually go through.


Second, the seller does not actually contribute anything of value into the contract until the transfer happens. The deed/title cannot be transfered to the contract itself. For all legal purposes, the seller still owns the property until both parties submit their acceptance. This means that although the buyer has made a commitment, the seller has actually committed nothing. If at the end of the 30 days they walk away, they have lost nothing and it cost them nothing.


Third, on the buyers side, entering into this contract is very costly. As discussed, the.probablility of the contract successfully executing is low, but they still have to commit. The seller need to place the crypto in the contract wallet, that means if the price keeps dropping and the contract fails, then they are stuck without any option to have mitigated their loss. On top of that, they have lost out on the use of that money for the time of the contract. If we are talking about a major purchase such as a car or house, it means that the buyer probably needs to take out a loan which will have an interest cost, and then pay X days of interest on the loan even though there is no guarantee the purchase will actually go through. Even if they dont need to take out a loan, the money could have been invested somewhere to provide a return (this is the oppurtunity cost).


All of these things are reasons why most large transactions are denominated in USD, not crypto, and why they are set up in certain ways. Now you could absolutely attempt to fix these issues by changing the incentives, adding in deriviatives and other contracts, but it is definately not going to be simple or elegant, and one really needs to think about the economics and incentives created before writing up these contracts.
Yeah, I need to look into it more as well.  


My initial skepticism is that individual users would rather just trust a large 3rd party than have the onus on themselves to figure out if the smart contract is actually doing what they think. Someone (or some group) has to convert the smart contract into lay-people terms, I think
You're right, they absolutely are third parties. 
But since they are not aware of being 3rd parties I think the risk of getting scammed is incredibly small. Especially if you take more than 1 weather app (for example) into account.
So obviously the examples are simpl, because....welll...they are examples. But sure lets look at something mire complicated, and remember that we can only contract on something that is publically identifiable and digital.

So let us say you are a marketing firm and you want to contract with clients on a smart contract.

So maybe the contract looks something like this:

1) Client deposits $10,000 into the smart contract.

2) If the client's twitter following within 3 months is 100k people, the contract pays the marketer $2,000.

3) If the client's facebook page has 10,000 followers in 3 months, the contract pays the marketer $1,000.

4) The contract pays the marketer $100 for every tweet which gets more than 1,000 likes, up to 30 tweets within 3 months.

5) The contract is hooked up to the hyperlinks in tweets, and the marketer gets paid $100 for each tweet link that is clicked at least 100 times, up to 30 links. (This may be also linked to the client CRM system, to actually capture sales, but not necessarily)

6) The contract pays a bonus to the marketer of up to $1,000 if the marketer has met the maximum for various goals. $200 for hitting 2, $500 for 3, and $1000 if the marketer hits all 4 goals.

7) 50% of earned Payments to the marketer are made at the end of each month. The remaining 50% is distributed at the end of the 3 month contract.

8) If certain goals are determined to be inflated (such as earning likes from bot accounts, or inflating clicks of links) The final distribution to the marketer is reduced by the amount that was incorrectly paid out. (This could be done for instance by looking at some decision tree for determining fake interactions, such as only counting on interaction per IP address etc)

9) Any money not distributed to the marketer after 3 months is returned to the client.




So what can we see about smart contracts here?

a) Contract terms need to be based on electronic observables.

b) It will usually require cash up front (although this risk for a business could be mitigated in certain ways)

c) Contract terms need to be based on measurable outcomes. Notice that none of the terms are based on ""hours worked"" or ""effort"". These would require outside input and be manipulated.

d) Because the contract is immutable, it should include contingencies for any events that might happen. 

e) Disputes are going to be harder to bring after the contract because the money will already be paid out.
As the technology gains adoption, I suspect most users won't know or care that their accounts are handled on a blockchain. Same as how they don't care why their credit card works now, I figure.

The bottom line is that it's cheaper, faster, and more secure than conventional methods. Adoption is just a matter of time, as it was with the internet.
This doesn’t sound very useful let alone smart to be honest. But thank you for the write up",,,,,,
,,,,Bad Trading Habits That Are Costing You Money,80.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/q011l0/bad_trading_habits_that_are_costing_you_money/,"How would you suggest a complete noob who does all the above actually learn to trade properly?
One of the most common bad habits that can lead to disaster is holding onto a money-losing trade once it moves well beyond your stop-loss level in the hopes that it will turn around—and then seeing it turn around and generate a profit. The profit itself reinforces the bad habit.  
But it's even worse if you congratulate yourself for holding on until the trade turns around. Coming out with a profit on a trade like this is almost always a result of luck. And luck always runs out, usually with disastrous results if stop-loss levels are ignored.  
Bad trading habits also involve not putting  STOP LOSS or not having realistic expectations.
No matter the bad habits or mistakes, JOURNAL EVERY TRADE. Then scan over it from time to time. Doing so keeps you from paying for same ""lessons learned"" more than necessary.
That's good advise, and many of those points apply to my trading history.

I don't consider myself a trader, although I do trade like once or twice a week (with a small profit). What I can recommend is having a trade journal and planning trades. Do not enter trades unplanned (e.g. as you wrote because you read something and then get emotional about it and just want to step in). Analyze your stock/index, define a signal and then wait for it. Only if the signal is confirmed, enter the trade, and make sure you have two exit scenarios: A stop loss and when to take profits.

I also found that I am good in giving advise but I am bad in following it myself. Jeez, I need more discipline.
Yeah the biggest thing imo is being able to identify your own mistakes . 

To realize what you did wrong , so you know what to avoid doing next time & you don't make that same mistake 


My biggest fuck ups are from my greed and impatience. 


I can honestly say that over time, through trial and error, I've actually grown to become a pretty decent day trader . 

I still don't meet the Day Trader 25k in Capital requirement , so I'm restricted to only 3 day trades a week and the rest are pretty much overnight swing plays . 

But every day trade I've done for the past few weeks/months , I've averaged $500+ in profit per trade . Just really sat down and re-evaluated my strategy. 


The issue I have , is ALWAYS after my day trade is done. 

I get my profits, I'm done for the day (I try to do a day trade once a day/every other day, otherwise doing 2 in one day kind of leaves the rest of the week to be a bit slow due to the 3 trades per 5 days limit ) , but then my greed kicks in and all I can think about is ""man I can't wait until I hit my goal and have unlimited trades"" , so I have an annoying and honestly foolish habit of buying into ANOTHER stock near the end of day , with the hopes of selling it the next morning for a nice extra profit.


Well, it never works that way lol. I always end up buying in , only to have the price start to dwindle downwards as the day ends. And then it Tanks in After Hours trading lol. 


And because of the PDT rule , I am forceddd to watch my money go down the drain because I can't sell my position otherwise I'd get a violation for going over my 3 trades. 


It's entirely on me. 
But at least I can identify that! 
And looking at it from a positive perspective , it's not a bad problem to have. I think I trade well

Just need to practice self control and not impulse buy into another position after already getting my profits for the day
Not having diamond hands.
Ty for this
For me biggest bad trading habit is selling my core position so I can average down and sometimes my entire position, most of the time it runs and I curse at my self for days. It's very stupid when I take moment and reflect on it. Most of my decisions don't make any sense later on! Ordered some Cbd oil, that should help out lol
Thank you Hari, you are a life saver. I always want to learn Option and the Greeks but your posts are easy to read and noob friendly.  
I got a question, I saw that you mentioned Call Debit & Call Credit a lot of time in several posts, so I assume you prefer trading bullish stocks. Do you also trade Put Debit & Put Credit Spreads for bearish stocks?
I just exposed myself as an average trader with much more to learn
Not holding on longer...

8 times out of ten, if I would have held longer, I would've experienced gains when I notice early losses on a trade strategy.
Tracking your trades consistently makes a huge difference. I use an awesome dashboard that allows me to see my performance very easily & all in one place. I have been able to gain an edge just by having the right tools to begin with!
Thank you for this.
How is day trading not momentum trading?

Most of the time you go for quick moving stocks and get in and out quickly.
Go to r/RealDayTrading for one - check out the wiki there.  Also - try this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/pi1idv/your\_10step\_guide\_on\_getting\_started/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3
Best way to learn is to learn from your mistakes. 
Re-evaluate what went right , what went wrong , and continue to do so as you keep practicing and learning what strategy works best for you
Call Debit & Put Credit = Bullish  

Call Credit & Put Debt = Bearish 

Depending on the trade a Call Credit or Put Credit can be neutral.
Yeah, exactly.

Today is a dark day for traders,45563.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l7awnp/today_is_a_dark_day_for_traders/,"This should scare all investors. These brokerage firms have just as much control over the market as social media does when choosing who to allow to post on their site. Not many people even knew they could legally stop a stock from being traded. This should cause fear and outrage for any investor, even if they don’t support the GME movement. What if one day they chose to remove the sell option when your position is tanking? This is so much bigger than GameStop, Blackberry, or any other stock banned today.
It was dark indeed. Tomorrow will be better considering they made GME, BB, NOK, and AMC the hottest stocks to buy right now. The amount of publicity those got today was mind blowing. Stay calm. The market is a mechanism to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient.

Edit: hold the line. See you in Valhalla 💃
Imagine if George Soros is in the middle of a fucking risky billionaire trade and his broker call him and say: ""well you're only allowed to sell now, sorry George but tomorrow after your strategy is absolutely fucked we'll resume the trading normally.""
Guys this is the brightest day in a long time. The entire country is openly talking about blatant market manipulation and major players are talking about how to better regulate the stock market. You have a congressperson on twitch at this very second talking about how great retail traders are and how they need more power. This could be the beginning of real change if we play our cards right
I put the following on the other sub, but I can share it here, too.

- - - - - - 

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: **We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.** Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1. Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.

2. Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.

3. Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4. Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5. At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6. Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7. The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: **The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.**  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital.  They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said **a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.**  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?  It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to [this remarkable (if infuriating) interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  **DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""?** Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie *Snowpiercer*?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

**TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.**  

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.
The really sad thing it is that the media is posing it as a philosophical question of whether brokers should protect uninformed investors against themselves, rather than protect billionaires from the reality of getting caught in bad trades. Even where the media recognizes the outrage as legitimate they absolutely mischaracterize it.
Today is the day to be MAD.  BE ANGRY.  Write to your representatives.  Tweet at Congress.  Demand accountability.
So here is some food for thought. 

This feature where stocks can be placed into “sell only” mode had to have been built in advance. This is the kind of feature that doesn’t just get pushed to production on a live and trading stock market on a whim, this feature had to have been built and properly tested long before it was used.

It makes me wonder what sorts of back room discussions have had to happen to even make this an option, let alone the circumstances that would lead up to it being used.
It clearly affected the market, it was clear manipulation of an active situation. It was a pure power move to leverage the Stocks and it had only one, clear beneficiary: those who shorted the stock. 
At a minimum any customers of those brokerz need to leave them for a broker who didn’t pull this shit. Optimally they should be punished by the SEC and the judicial system, hard. I am happy my (European) broker did not do anything but feel monumentally pissed on behalf of those affected.

**Sign the petition here: https://www.change.org/p/u-s-securities-and-exchange-commission-sec-retail-investors-demand-market-transparency-please-sec-amend-form-13f-requirements**


Retail Investors demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing. Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**


We the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.


**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**


*Filing of Form 13F. A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*


**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions. Why?**


*Question 41
Q: What about short positions?
A: You should not include short positions on Form 13F. You also should not subtract your short position(s) in a security from your long position(s) in that same security; report only the long position.*


**Contact the SEC and let them know retail investors demand increased transparency (https://www.sec.gov/contact-information/sec-directory)**
Who's gonna play DFV in the movie?
[Google](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GME:NYSE) shows that GME went to 490$ at 2pm EST. But I don't see on other platforms. Is that glitch or what? can someone confirm if they saw what google is showing?
This is progress!!  No generation prior to this would have been as aware or engaged as we are.  We are taking ownership of this space and we will not be stopped by this.  They will not beat us.  Even though they're trying to take their ball and go home, we're all still holding out here on the court and ready to dunk on them tomorrow.  Robinhood was considered unique and democratic for its time.  Its time has passed.  Our entire generation and future generations will remember this moment.  We will move forward from this with heads held high and new clarity.  The next democratic finance iteration will have more clarity and will be even more of a level playing field.  The system will continue to improve because we are engaged and calling bullshit when we see it.  From us on reddit to the guys like Chamath and Elon and Justin Kan and Mark Cuban.



There's still short to cover, and we still like the stock
It is indeed one of the darkest day ever...I just cannot phantom the fact that brokerages won't let retail investors buy stocks which they think are too speculative and volatile.. the whole market is overpriced and as an investor I have a right to buy what I want and at whichever price...if it falls onus is on investor. Clearly it's a tactic to save the hedge funds. The Wall Street curruption must end..
Tomorrow opening we dine in hell, let’s lunch GME AMC NOK BB  on the moon
This isn't over by any stretch... they played their hands yesterday and today - blatant craven market manipulation... but it's not enough to save the shorts at this point.  GME is still shorted well over 100%... if you've got the money to lose I suggest you get in the fight and buy tomorrow in the AM when markets open.  The REAL short squeeze has yet to happen.  IF DFV IS STILL IN, I'M STILL IN... GME to the moon or bust.  Fuck the hedge funds - this isn't about making some money on a position to me or to hundreds of thousands of us... this is about making a point now.  Diamon hands brethren... the hedge funds have played all their cards - all we have to do is HOLD and wait for them to cave.  THIS IS THE WAY
Google Play is also helping robinhood by erasing nearly 100K negative reviews. 

A bunch of crooks. SMH
Anyone still having stop losses is stupid at this point.
How can people ever trust the stock market again after this unless sweeping reform happen?
Hey guys... lets stand strong. If you can financially afford a GME stock.... buy 1. We're going to prove a point. 

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE :)
Indeed it should be written down in history, the battle is not lost is just a little obstacle i say

FOR THE PEOPLE!
It’s disgusting and they should pay.... no matter what you use your money to invest in.
I stayed out of the GME mania this whole time but tomorrow I am buying what I can for $1k and not selling untill I'm either dead or homeless. This is personal now and I don't care about the money at all. If this helps the retail investors to fuck over these crooked bastard I am more than happy to donate to the cause. I will keep the shares as memorabilia
the whole financial services industry is now going to be put under a microscope. It's been an old boys club for a long time and now the scales have begun to tip the other way. A lot of very rich and powerful people are going to pull out all the stops to prevent their buddies from being bankrupt and I just hope that the ""regulators"" hold the correct people accountable. We've all been conditioned to expect NOTHING from them so far, so we'll see if anything changes.
Can someone explain to me why bb and nok are caught up in this hype when they are not shorted companies like gme amc and bbby? Don't get me wrong I got all of these and I am HOLDING 💎 🙌

 but just trying to understand why these two stocks are involved
I watched Robinhood CEO interview on Bloomberg and it was just straight garbage out of his mouth.  He was just spinning the answers in circle and interview was just shaking her head.
Whether or not it was a dark day depends on what happens next. And I don’t mean whether GME goes to the moon or not, but whether we actually see consequences and change as a result of this lifting the veil of this fraud. It is naked to the public eye now - and for that we must thank the investors
Brokers like Robinhood have been selling user data and manipulating the market for a long time. Today was just the first time they made it blatantly obvious that they were doing it.
Chinese looking at us saying “and you think our business practices are fucked up?”
Stocks closed significantly down from yesterday’s prices mainly due to short sellers, trade halting and some panic selling giving hedge funds and market makers to make their moves during market hours.  At close when it was announced trading for retail investors will resume the stock price goes up giving these Wall Street elites the opportunity buy and drive up the stock price after hours only to sell it to us retail investors now that trading for us is allowed.
My aunt worked at pg from the age of 18. Proctor and gamble. She’s like 70ish now. She took stock instead of Christmas bonus every year. In 2005 she had a million dollars in shares. In 2008 she had 30 grand in shares and my uncle convinced her to sell the shares before they went even lower. He died of cancer and the shares recovered a few years later. I always think of the hedge fund or banker who made her million dollars. She was a simple person who made a big mistake. She worked the line and management for 47 years at the same company and saw them grow into a huge company. She drinks a bottle of wine every night.
Fuck them all🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾‼️‼️‼️
We the People ‼️🤬🤬🤬🤬
Remember how Black Friday in 1929 influenced an entire generation to not trust banks? Well, this is the exact same reason we’ll have an entire generation not trust the stock market
The fight is far from over. The chickens will come to roost. Apes strong together!
I didn't get involved in this but Robinhood users need to abandon that shithole of a company.
Do you know what brokerages never stopped people buying?


Edit: seems to be a mic if at least fidelity and schwab. Td ameritrade too as they only stopped margin calls.
This is the problem with free brokerages. They're beholden to the big guys.
I didn’t believe the market was so rigged before today. Fuck those cocksuckers

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

Worst part, that even if they get fined or see a class action, how will anyone be able to show harm? Because of their manipulation, I saw my stock value drop $30K. No one will reimburse us for that. Insane
What happened today was blatant market manipulation against the retail investor. But the war is far from over...they are scared. DO NOT SELL!
On one hand it's infuriating to see just how much power the 1% has and showcasing that there are almost no depths they won't sink to in order to protect their own unbridled greed at the expense of everyone else. On the other hand, it's also fascinating because usually the control systems that they implement to rig the game in their favor aren't quite so visible. 

Usually it's like this: there is a $20 bill for you. You have to run a complicated obstacle course in order to get it. There's a bunch of arbitrary rules that you don't really understand and you get penalized for breaking. Oh, you wor e shoes with green shoelaces that day? That's minus a $1.50. you finished the obstacle course in less than 11 minutes and 43 seconds? That's minus $3 right there. You break a couple more rules that you didn't know were there and you grab the $20 bill. After the deductions for breaking these rules and after taxes, you're left with $7. You feel like you kind of got ripped off but at least you got your $7 at the end of the day and you're happy about that. 

Today it was like this: there's a $20 bill sitting on the table for you. You walk over and grab it. You immediately get dog piled by a half dozen men who rip the $20 bill out of your hand, beat you half to death with baseball bats, and then throw you off of the balcony.

Overall it's just really disheartening because I think we all know how this is going to play out: there's going to be some kind of kangaroo court investigation by some kind of governing body, citadel is going to admit no wrongdoing and they're going to pay a couple million dollar fine and yet walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars of profit. To them, fines like the one that is going to No doubt inevitably come of this are simply a business expenditure. In order to make x amount of profits, they need to spend y amount of money. It's no different to them than corporate offices or the monthly electric bill.
And we just bailed out wall street for the second time in 10 years , just a couple months ago . Remember when big biz got all that stimulus money and the people did not get squat? Well they had planned on taking most of it back with thier market manipulation.  I dont see how people can be so calm about them litterally always ripping us off ,while taking all the stimulus while we are made to sleep in cars with our familys because rent was due but prayer didnt make the stock option print .
What happened today was completely unacceptable. It just confirms that there is no such thing as a free market and that the stock market is manipulated.
If I over-leverage/make a bad call, brokerages aren't going to come save my ass. The shorts need take responsibility for their choices. Take the bad with the good like any other investor.....
supposed to be a free trade market but just like freedom of speech, that shit gone right out the damn window. lets continue, whats next on the short list?
You only lose money if you sell.
This is very dark, very interesting, today we have all seen some true colours...
I’m in for 10 more GME. Fuck them tomorrow
We are just serfs to them, fuck them revolt
This is why DeFi is so important. If we don't forget what happened here brokers will all be replaced by DeFi in 10 to 20 years.

Edit: DeFi = Decentralized Finance
You can protest by HOLDING there are still tons of shorts needed to be returned.
It's truly fucked up, they must have really been in deep shit if they pulled something as obvious as this in order to get the price back down.  This is one step away from just going into the system and changing the price to $100, or sending out an email notifying every that due to a glitch in the system we sold all your shares.  You realize these ideas were probably brought up at some point.

What would be the full impact if they didn't slam the brakes?  I know everyone wants to say 'a few hedge fund billionaires would lose money' but that's being a bit dismissive.  We saw what happened in the market yesterday and, well, it wasn't good.  We need to realize there may be a larger consequence to this than rich people losing money, it could crash the entire market.

As much as I want the little guy to win, if it means bringing down the house and wiping out my entire portfolio I am not so sure.  I think no matter how this ends a lot of people will be very hesitant before they shoot off a lowball target price so they can short a company.

Edit; to add to the shady list E*TRADE won’t give ah price on GME. Is E*TRADE next to refuse to allow buys?
I agree it’s a dark day but nothing new. Read anything about bucket shops and how markers used to work even 40 or 60 years ago and today comes as no surprise at all
People shouldn’t forget this. A lot of it *is* young kids who yolo’d their stimulus money, which is all good, but we need to have a broader attention span if we want actual change. The war has always been against Wall Street; we did NOTHING in 08 when they raped the country. People mobilized over a dumb ass conspiracy that was completely false, how do we convince people to take (peace yet drastic) action on legitimately corrupt investors?
It’s gonna seem reductive, lol, but it’s accurate:

Of fucking course they did exactly that. The markets are literally designed and regulated, thanks to Citizens United v US, to be preferential to wealth. The rich choose/lobby their odds in the stock market, and have increasing choice of odds with increasing wealth.

The only thing that happened differently today is that they were less abstract in controlling markets
At 8am RH locks trading for 13 tickers popular among retail investors, for **no reason at all**. They only issue a confirmation **45 minutes later**

#SAD
💎THEY TRIPLED DOWN ON AMC SHORTING 💎 

Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: 

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

🚀🚀🚀

THEY WANNA SHUT US DOWN ON ROBINHOOD, WE AINT BACKING DOWN. WERE OPENING OTHER BROKERAGES. I LOVE THE MOVIE THEATERS!!!! 🍿🍿🍿
I really need help my buying power went from 33000 to suddenly having an account deficit? Where did my money go? It looked as if my transfers went through already and I haven't received any help on this...
lol it will go down in the history books as ""never actually happened, everything was way over-hyped"" move along folks we'll take our multi-trillion dollar bailout and be on our way.
I got in 4 shares of gme and 10 of amc today. Fuck the fucking fucks, apes hold the line, apes have 💎🙌🏽, 🦍 rule shit right now

This week must change things, and I’m throwing in what I can to be part of history. The 🚀 is but frosting on the cake.
Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood went on CNBC today to boast about how their app is #1 in the app store. Let's pissed him off by taking it off the ranking. You guys know what to do.
> In the last generation most of the people thought about the stock market as something abstract and only reserved to the richest getting richer, only having a clue about what Wall Street is thanks to movies.

I don't know if that's entirely true, I've been playing the markets since the 1990s, probably my mid-30s. I was in software development and a lot of us started getting into it because that was when you first were able to trade stocks online. But then you did say ""most people"", so you could still be right.

Before the 1990s, you had to have a broker, like an actual person, and one person with a business card, not an interchangeable call center contact. You could only buy in 100 unit blocks, and you had to have your money all set up, and there were fairly high minimums just to be allowed to trade, it was a big hassle. Most people were in the market anyway, with mutual funds in their 401K plans. You couldn't really trade, but you could at least participate in the market, so most people in that situation would follow the stock market. 

I remember when a real estate bubble popped in 1987, a sell off started and I just ignored it, but my co-worker lamented that he spent the whole day trying to get through to his broker. He was lucky he didn't! He would have lost a lot selling in a panic, but he cooled down and just held onto it after that, and came out ok.

What you kiddoes are doing is pretty cool though, and it's true that y'all are deep into stocks at a much earlier age than was even possible before. I've been following wsb for a while, and even made some money off of their tips. One thing I love about what you're doing is that you aren't afraid of losing money.

The only way to really learn is to put money into it. Before you do that, it's just all to abstract to care about, but once your own money is at stake, you become hyper aware, your brain becomes far more able to absorb knowledge and data, and to achieve some understanding of what's going on.

One thing I find funny is that the local news stations are all treating this as one of their lite, smiley stories. It's great to see these GenX newscasters cheerily talking about ""Wall Street Bets"", subreddits, Robinhood, short selling, and hedge funds like ""Oh those cute l'il Zoomers!"" They have interviews with local investors (I'm in Dallas), and they're all ""Well, it's great to see young people getting so involved in investing. I just hope they don't lose too much money at it <chuckle>.""

I guess what I'm saying is, the underlying attitude is ""Yeah, fuck those hedge fund managers!"" Nobody is calling wsb ""financial terrorists"" or anything like you might expect.
Today we learned America does not have a free market. We learned as soon as the regular guys participate in the market the way wall street does everyday the off switch will be flipped for millions of us! It’s ok if we take home pennies. No one cares about that as long as Wall Street takes in their billions. It’s only a free market for the rich
Pretty disappointing. I'm young and relatively new to investing, but this whole debacle has made me extremely pessimistic about the entire market, volatile stock or not.

Why should I invest in the market if some rich prick or a collection of them can literally do whatever they want with my money? Why aren't there better regulations to make sure these guys have to play with the same rule book as me? 

Fuck this, I'm buying golden dubloons and storing them in a wooden chest.
Thanks for this OP. Their action was not cool, and we will remember.
[deleted]
This is disgusting. And it's not over. If/when Redditors organize to counter this, I want in on it.
I genuinely believe the lack of faith in wall street this has caused will result in the bursting of the bubble. Who knows. Either way... it was f\*cked.
Guaranteed it will be known as the big squeeze, at least until another one comes around
Will they now do this to any stock that makes an unexpected jump? How do they reintroduce these stocks at some point?  Do they wait until they drop all the way back down?  Do they do it quietly or come up with some excuse?
Them trying to “protect us” by preventing us from buying is what lost us retail investors money? I dont get the BS fake logic at all.
Soooooo do we buy gme and AMC tomorrow once Robinhood allows limited trading?
The people’s hedge fund will be a thing .... just a matter of time .
Imagine owning a publicly traded company and this happens to you. What’s your recourse? Sue?
 'we did this to protect you'

Oh you offer protection? let me get a refund on all my losses then.
This was truly something else. I’ve made some risky plays and lost a lot. At the end of the day, I had myself to blame. Don’t get me wrong, I know buying GME was risky, but to lose like this? I’ve never felt anger like this towards the market.
Totally agree. Not letting regular people buy those shares, while still allowing to sell? Sounds very suspicious to me.
Even though I think that GME and whatnot are like gambling nowadays... but it's now a matter of rights.
They've been exposed as the casinos they are. It's disgusting and I want to see people jailed for it. Clearly money comes easily to these people- so let them sweat it out behind bars.
Oh this shit is worse than most know.  My broker who I use to use told me flat out that no amount of money is being allowed to buy any of the ""listed"" stocks.  If you had them it was a sell ONLY option!  Like wtf is this...it is my money so get fucked!  So I told him he just lost my entire portfolio.  

Now the best part...douche account manager gets on the phone telling me ""it would be a mistake moving at such a volatile time"". ""Doing so will put your portfolio in a position of great loss""  

Me: ""You just signed your own SEC complaint and lawsuit sweet cheeks! I tell you what I want and where I want it.  Not the other way around.  With that said, draft the closure of my account ready to move and close out any and all transactions we had scheduled!""
I'll never forget the only time my job was threatened.

I worked in a financial data provider. We provided many investment firms, funds, banks, etc with their data. Currencies trade constantly. The close price for a currency is the last reported trade for the day, within a specific timezone. The year end close - i.e. the last trade of the year - is especially important as it is used in a lot of different calculations and valuations for offshore funds.

One new years day I received a call telling me that the year end close for one currency was wrong. WTF does that even mean? I logged on, and had a look at the logs and timeseries. Everything looked mostly normal. There was a bit of volatility, which was unusual to happen leading up to midnight, but not unheard of. I checked our competitors and other sources and saw the exact same figure. 

I replied back saying that the data was correct, provided trades leading up to and after the trade used for the end-of-year close. There was like a percent spread over a time period. Nothing worry some at all. Except to the fund manager. 

Their fee was based on their fund's performance. And their fund had underperformed to a point that the 1% difference in the close they wanted versus were given meant that they couldn't pay themselves that fee (and also had to explain to their investors). 

I couldn't care about their issues. The data was correct and I closed the issue. An hour later I received a call from my boss. I explained the situation. I could have changed the data (I was one of 3 who had the rights), but correcting data was done rarely. A half hour after that, I received a call from my boss and his boss. We spoke about it. I was asked how quickly I could change the data. I lied and said it would take many hours, but it took me a few seconds. If we changed the end of year close, we'd have to notify all customers of the change. And explain why we had to do it. And get them to redo all of their calculations on their models, valuations, etc.

The third phone call included the c-level. And I was flat out given a choice: Change the data or change my job. 

That fund manager bitched and whined and moaned to our company owners enough that the execs got shat on, and of course we know in which direction shit flows.

So I changed it. And I let all our account managers know. And they spent weeks apologizing for all the additional work that the change that created a load of work for all our other clients who used that data.

So that's how I learned to hate fund managers.
When they said “we had to stop the losses” in this case it 100% means they had to stop the winnings. The money was just going to the wrong people and that is it.
Dave Portnoy made a great point about this. He said that obviously Vlad tenev had to know that this would cause Robinhood to blow up in his face and that would be the end of Robin Hood as we know it. Now I am concerned with who’s got his back, how much money did he make off this deal,  etc. there’s so many backdoor possibilities on this and I’m so excited to see what the outcome is. hopefully like Portnoy said people will be jailed for this.
Just fyi, CNBC is now running a campaign to try to save their buddies asses. They are claiming this all happened in concert because of ""liquidity concerns."" Do not fall for this. Do not let anyone who is not in the market fall for this. This is literal class warfare and needs to be treated as such. These people need to go to prison and be bled dry or else they win.
I had positions in Black Berry and Nokia that I took and risked with my own money. On Wednesday these positions became very valuable. On Thursday they colluded to crash the market and likely all of these hedge funds modified their positions to exit shorts and buy calls... Today I have recovered 15% of what I lost yesterday, showing the magnitude of the theft.   


We finally get an advantage and THEY CAN'T PAY because they are leveraged 15x... Meanwhile the small retailer trader gets liquidated OR forbidden to participate in the market so their positions are made worth less through other means.  


I am sick to my stomach and they will get away with this because we are SO SOFT on financial crime and NO ONE GOES TO JAIL.
This was my post to my fb community (and in the FB post i had to take out the stock names...I think fb was blocking GME and AMC traffic too...):

How is it that no one is posting about $GME $AMC did all you armchair activists all get up to take a shit at the same time??

This is likely to be the only actual redistribution of wealth in your lifetime (in anyone's) so I will explain: 

A market analyst who'd been tracking GME (gamestop) since 2018 started buying long everytime he noticed hedge funds going short and ended up exposing the most significant bit of publicly available wall street corruption since 2007. Wall street fund managers had been colluding using a market vehicle called a short which is a bet against a company. But with the billions  available to a hedge fund they can actually devalue the company with such a technique, and with each penny change in stock price they made millions (or more) and then passed it off to another fund that made millions in the next penny decline. The result of this being so successful that wall street actually had more short positions outstanding than GME had shares outstanding...enter the analyst who'd been buying the shares and over 2 years following the stock who calls out this illegal collusion AND the precarious position the hedge funds created for themselves. 

Due to their short positions, at some point the hedge funds legally have to (literally) buy the stock at a later date. If you or I or Jenny from the block all hold the shares of stock, they have to buy it from us. If you hold it and wait, the price will go up because demand is increasing and with time their positions get more precarious, and ultimately they will stop waiting us out and start competing with other hedge funds to buy out these shorts as quickly as possible. And they spend the millions they made devaluing the stocks to pay you at  the higher prices the market now demands for stocks like GME and AMC, and the result is that prices go up and then the next fund buys before it's too late and instead of our 401ks getting ruined it is their I'll gotten hedge fund gains being depleted. Caveats apply and guaranteed they are trying to avoid this with nefarious and  political/regulatory means but:

In short (get it??) they are stuck having to pay you with the money they've been scamming from you since they crashed the economy and got bailed out for in 2007-2009. And they will do this by selling the ""reliable"" long stocks that are too popular to easily manipulate like APPL or AMZN and when they take billions out of those stocks to pay you for your shares of GME to cover the positions they are legally bound to cover. As a result the prices of stocks AAPL and most other stocks will artificially decline. And since you have all that money they just paid you for GME or AMC you can then buy AAPL or AMZN at a deep discount, locking in your position there the same way wall street had previously locked you out. So in the end, you own a piece of the stack market that previously had only been accessible to wall street.

At least in theory. Markets are volatile and this will be a financial battleground individuals always get screwed by the institutions somehow. This isn't financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor,  and I can't give you financial advice. 

What I will say is this: Pundits, politicians, and propagandists (and stock brokers) love a dose of modern activism  because it means donations and click throughs and campaign funds which means revenue which means job security which means their hedge funds get filled and their hedge fund managers collect fees and nothing changes for the people your intention or donation was intended to help. It's a system that the elite use to keep themselves elite and there is no trickle down except for the occasional feint they use to placate the masses like the affordable care act which still makes ""them"" more money than it benefits anyone else. But if the system breaks and we end up owning a larger piece of wall street than the general population has ever owned in history, they will reevaluate and change the system that caused them losses. and this moment in history represents a chance to have a voice and a share in that change because we can own it. It's quite literally taking the power back. not for a week or a month or an election cycle but for generations.

Don't occupy wall street. Democratize wall street. 

TLDR? Smh. 

(Still not giving any advice...I'm not a financial advisor and I'm not giving you advice. These might not even be the author's own opinions or beliefs for all we know my account got hacked I'm never on fb anyway after all and why would I spend all this time writing what is definitely not financial advice to a bunch of people who think a meaningful change happens when they switch the color of their Facebook profile picture)
If you're just a buy & hold forever ETF & blue chip investor enjoying the 10% average annual gains, are you still a victim of market manipulation?
I'm still so pissed they did this. I really cannot believe it.
It's not over yet.  History will talk about this week and next, not just today.

Fuck these pricks.  We're taking then down.  We were *seconds* away today.  They're out of ammo.
""The Great Shart of 2022""
Is there a class action lawsuit? Who exactly gets to make a lawsuit against them bc i got affected by this (as well as many many others obviously)
I sold today. I hate it. I’m angry. They knew if they put us in a place of uncertainty we’d have to choose. 

I chose to cash out money that will help my family in a time when we need it. No shame. I should be proud of my earnings and success. 

Instead though I feel angry. I feel let down. I’m having a difficult time expressing what I feel. An institution took away our ability to buy. Only left us with the option to sell, and then proceeded to yank the stock. 

As I watched my earning dwindle into uncertainty I did what many other surely did: sold. 

I’m angry.
indeed, today it was broadcast to the world that the US stock market is rigged entirely for the 1%.  the yog have been reminded of their place.
You lost me at “partecipate”
dark day for the auditors, clearly nobody reads gme s financial statements and just decide to yolo lol but yea market manipulation should be illegal
Boycottt the stock market
The crash of 2021 it’s due and this is the perfect spark 💣💣💣💣💣💣🌡🌡💭💭💭💭💭
Do not forget Covid 19 crash of 2020.
Can someone explain to me in Layman’s terms what happened? I don’t really understand stocks and stuff. Is it that normal people were getting a lot of money and the rich were taking heavy losses, so the people up top stopped trading to cater to the rich? If so, the system again proves to be rigged!
Crash of 20 was nice enough let me remortgage my house if the market crashes again
I learned of this one earlier this year. But story of The Scam 1992 around Harshad Mehta in India and how he screwed over the entire Indian market using the same tactics the big banks use is worth taking a look at.

Much closely ties in with what is currently happening than The Big Short does. There is a book and a mini series that came out fall last year. The show was pretty good.
This is unfair. If retail investors were losing their asses on short sales they couldn't cover, Robinhood would step up and intervene... Right?....... right?
Great day for gamers.
This is unreal. People need to be locked up for this. You can’t say it’s a free market then block people from trading, manipulate the market, change the rules with bases loaded. Under the pretense that they’re trying to “protect” us. Don’t piss on our backs and tell us it’s raining.
Wait? When exactly did you come to realise that the most cherished and famous ""American Dream"" and ""American Freedom"" is for the financial elite only. Ordinary guys are not worth a dry decomposed piece of shit, except when it's time for elections. This wasn't a dark day for traders,  it was a ""fuck you and stay in your fucking limits"" day. 

Dislike my comment all you want but we all know it's the truth.
With world wide retail investors we will win today 🎉. January 29 - 2021 will be a day to remember. You expect some tricks from the 🤡 and the masses will get their 💵. BlackBerry is still undervalued. Do not sell. You only loose money when you sell. BB & GME are going to the moon en beyond 🚀🚀🚀
Time to yeet the rich
Pretty crazy that Apple has removed the 1 star reviews for RH.   It is now back to a 4.7 after Apple removed them.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/robinhood-investing-for-all/id938003185

Really do not think Apple should be removing them.  Are they not valid?
Fuck Robinhood! Everyone should look for a new broker. Saying that I have to acknowledge that it is a rigged game after all. It’s their turf, their referees, their rules, even half of the spectators are cheering them on and they can change the rules while the game is on and no one can do anything about it!! Sad day indeed!
SUE THE BASTERDS
Let’s do it for $AMC also.
If my math is correct, every $1 increase in GME will cost the shorts $98M.  


STICK IT TO THESE COCKSUCKERS!!!!!
 “I feel bad for the hedge fund guys” - **No One EVER**
\#ICYMI, these hedge funds and their large banking and brokerage partners (which proliferate shorts by lending out the shares to enable such scams) are *bigly* funding politicians, and I'm not just talking Citizens United or your garden variety super PACs. There's the board seats, the lobbying positions, the speaking fees, the consultant gigs and [Bob's your uncle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_your_uncle) careers for the public servant's spouse, partner, mistress, toy-boy, child, or relative, and the list goes on.

In return, there's little regulation, and if somebody gets caught, it'll be a slap on the wrist, *usually with no admission of wrongdoing*. They're basically cutting the government an extra check for a small share of the take when they get too greedy and get caught.

Here's a trivia question for you: Do you know how many bankers went to prison for their part in the 2008 market crash?

In Iceland: 25.

In the US: 1 (one), and that [fall guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Serageldin) was an Egyptian immigrant working for a Swiss bank.

He pled guilty in 2013 to *conspiracy to falsify books and records* and received 30 months quality time in federal housing. The SDNY prosecutors had asked for 45 years.

Oh, and one year later in 2014, same fall guy [settled with the SEC](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-21/ex-credit-suisse-cdo-chief-must-pay-more-than-1-million) to the tune of $1M. His salary in 2007 alone was $7.1M. The damages on the other hand came in at appr. $540M. In other words, the aforementioned slap on the wrist.

To paraphrase Louis Rossmann, that's the equivalent of parking meters on your street charging 10 bucks per hour, but the parking ticket's just a quarter and the meter maid shows up maybe once a year. Normal people feed the meters, hedge funds wait for the ticket in the mail.

So don't be surprised that Robinhood, who *allegedly* makes 40% of their revenue lending their customers stocks out to Melvin Capital, and who yesterday banned retail investors from buying volatile stocks right around the time when Citadel (who had just [injected $2B](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/citadel-point72-to-invest-275-billion-in-melvin-capital) into Melvin) *allegedly* doubled down on shorts, will end up with a slap on the wrist, some sourpuss faces during congressional hearings, and maybe a new CEO for Robinhood, Melvin Capital, and Citadel.

Fun fact: Gabriel Plotkin, the founder and CIO of Melvin Capital, had already been [investigated by the SEC back in 2013](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS310089300120130403) for insider trading, left the crime scene at SAC Capital unscathed, and started his own Wall Street shakedown operation back in 2014.

Bonus fun fact: Janet Yellen, the former Federal Reserve vice-chair, who just got confirmed with 84-15 votes in the US Senate as the next treasury secretary, received [$810K from Citadel](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/yellen-robinhood-citadel-gamestop-speaking-fees) during 2018 to 2020. Oh, and according to a whistleblower, *allegedly* somebody from the White House had called Robinhood before the barred their customers from buying stocks *allegedly* still shorted by Melvin Capital and *allegedly* now also Citadel.

IMHO, if you want to revert a nation back from an [Oligarchy](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746) to a functioning democracy, elections must be, above and beyond limited private donations, government-funded (meaning limited funds, reimbursed based on election results) with *no exceptions* for corporations, campaign windows limited, TV airtime balanced, guaranteed, and *fact-checked*. Oh, and if you're not the guy running for office, you can't buy an ad for that guy on social media. Make it a law; I dare you, I *double-dare* you, Mo...

Bonus IMHO: Stop this bullshit to register for a party during voter registration. You want to be a member of a political party, join the party, let that party run their primaries on their own dime and time, but stop registering your affiliation with the government, it's none of their fucking business. Once that's out of the way, automatic voter registration is a no-brainer - as it is in most other developed countries on this planet.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** When you're a hedge fund, you can sell more houses which you don't own than there are actual houses on the market. That's apparently legal.

My biggest concern?

Absolutely nothing is going to happen.  This is going to be swept under the rug because the billionaires are going to shove money in politicians faces so that they look the other way.

I do think now a ton of new reddit accounts are going to pop up and there will be thousands of fake users that will try and manipulate reddit or give a heads up to any elite that something is brewing.
Anyone else remember RH/Brokerage Firms halting trading when people were losing hand over fist in early March/April during the early stages of the pandemic? Me neither.

I know one thing, I'm never using Robinhood again after I reap my GME tendies.
They changed the rules of the game in the middle of the game. Why? Because fuck em' that's why.
Can I ask how this is comparable to complete economic collapses? Are thousands of people going to lose their jobs and homes? Or did some billionaire just lose some wealth?
You guys need to class action those pissheads
The solution is clear.

No manipulation by design.

\#FUCK WALL STREET
I don’t know nothing about stocks but I’ve seen what all you crazy bastards are doing and it’s great!

A wise man once said to me on YouTube “stay hard”, so all you crazy motherfuckers stay the fuck hard!
Call me paper handed, but after seeing the fuckery and all the trading halts. That to me means I lost control over my shares so I got out. When the game is rigged I’m not fucking interested in playing.
Cash app let's you buy AMC NOK instantly.
Just remember, when its white collar theft its never called theft. Its just chalked up as accounting discrepancies or adjustments.
AOC too the moon right row 🚀 🚀 🚀
It made me sick to watch. I was still able to trade Nokia and blackberry and it felt like cheating being able to buy and such low prices. Everyone is angry because this has been a rigged market for some time and nothing has been done about it.
It's also the day millions in losses were averted by new retail traders with fomo not understanding that what does go up will come down as they attempted to leverage themselves to hell while asking, ""wait, what's 'margin'?""
I hate to tell you all this but today was not a dark day.  Today was a revolution.  If you take GME for example only 50 million shares traded.  That volume was getting done in one hour prior to today.  

If you think the shorts are out now you are insane.   Tonight the brokers are reloading and getting funding to enable US, YOU AND I to trade tomorrow.  I know you don't want to hear this but they had to save themselves to save you and I. If Robinhood, ETrade, Webull became insolvent due to the settlement period reserves they had to carry THEN we would truly be fucked.  This didn't happen.  

I was here in 2000, I was here in 2008.  NONE of those controls were in place and us boomers or whatever insulting term you want to call us watched as the world imploded around us and our retirement turned to dust.  **That did not happen today.**

Tonight they are getting funded, tonight they are readying for the storm, tonight I believe they are striving to fulfill their promise to us all.  **LET THEM TRADE.**  

If I'm wrong flame me into oblivion.  If I'm right please donate at least a portion of your tendies to St. Jude.
Some people made money and I am happy but alot more will loose much more than money. Which is why I dont like this craziness because it makes people, who knows nothing about investing, believe stocks only go up. Anyways good luck to whoever is stuck into this mess. I only hope that market, overall, stays healthy and all kinds of investors enjoy growth.
Is this the death of capitalism as we know it ?
I just need a nice run up like this on SQ so I can afford the $23,000 to go through IVF again with my girl.    Then I'll be less angry at those clown shoes.
Can we do the same with AMC ?
We shall call it. Traitorous Thursday
NOK NOK NOK
I don't think people realize how this trading works. 

You don't actually have to pay for a stock for 2 or 3 days after you buy it. If someone doesn't pay up at settlement, the broker has to do it. 

Brokers are worried that this stock price isn't going to sustain and in two days, they could have a boatload of buyers that are backing out of trades which leaves them on the hook to pay the sellers. 

So with the billions in market cap that has been added to GME, can you blame brokerages for refusing to broker a trade that they might end up holding the bag for?
My question is how will this impact the future of the stock market. People will have to go to jail
Yes dark day for trading, for each and every one of us.
If they are not punished, tomorrow they can do it to any ticker or company they feel they wanna go against. 
Nobody is safe. That's my primary concern.
I remember throwing quite a bit of puts before the first presidential debate knowing it would be a really stupid affair that would hopefully make some people decide to pull some money back in reserve. Whilst I was losing all of my money I asked Robinhood to stop allowing people to buy so that I wouldn’t go broke.

Spoiler alert: they did not.
I actually am optimistic about it. It has opened the eyes of so many. We need to revolt
Burn Wall Street down, ""Eat the rich"" has never been more appropriate than this very moment...
I can image that the market will be harsh on retail traders by banning them from trading meme stocks/surging stocks, by simply saying we protect you from volatility. Screw them. They are going to ban any stock from trading as they think fits. The listing companies and SEC should not allow this to happen.
Or what if; hey bro it's your broker!  Looks like your shorts need to get covered now! We can't have you risking over 100% of this trade anymore cause it cost you your whole portfolio. Better luck next time! You were a billionaire🏨, you can earn it back like everyone else; in the stock market game.
United we stand! Divided we fall!
Borrowing stock is basically a cluster fuck waiting to happen
Can we find another stock to hop on
it’s not even just people who are interested or are trading on the stock market, it’s the general public

my 401k dropped $600 today because of the fuckery robinhood pulled that caused mass selling of shares in everything. that fucking BLOWS and imagine what can happen to others because of it
""I will make it legal""
Cant believe I am apart of this. So proud of how far we've gone. We just like the stock.
We're not done.
I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to forgive myself. I panic sold bc I thought Robinhood would permanently ban GME. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I ran to Reddit to see if any news had been posted. Nothing. It was spam and stupid bots pumping amc. I sold. My 344 shares. I can’t move my money, I can’t buy them back. I tried to cancel the order literally seconds later to no avail. I don’t know what to do. Fuck Robinhood and I hope the company goes bankrupt paying for the losses they caused millions of people.
Trust in the stock market needs to be restored for the next generation or it's done. Meaning NOT to allow hedge fund manipulation or only allowing to sell like on Robin hood and others, wtf.
Every good Bond movie needs that last minute turnaround by the villain where the hero then needs to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.

It is remarkable that we were outwitting and outmuscling them. Then they tried to outcheat us.

We will see.
The most absurd about this whole event is seeing politicans from all different political spectrums and who hate each other agreeing that this was a horrible move by robinhood and other brokers.
It was thought as abstract and for only the wealthy because they kept it that way. Now is  the time that it is for the people. The problem is, is it might come with a price. Are you willing to bet on that like you are a company?
This was a new type of disenfranchisement
Looks like we need to keep talking and making moves as a conglomerate. If they want to play games lets make it hard for them. EAT THE RICH.
The darkest hour is just before the dawn comrades! fight, hold, never surrender! 🚀🚀🚀
I wonder (read:hope) if I'm mistaking 'robinhood finacial llc supporting citron' is actually having to do with RH sitting on less money than we realize, thusly affecting their IPO success. The ceo guy mentioned 'clearinghouse', and I'm hypothesizing Robinhood either Did what daddy Citron told them to do, or if they simply did not have the liquidation to get the orders filled, therefore throwing their own kill switch. I dunno but short that IPO ASAP!
""He who sells what isn't his'n, must pay the price or go to prison.""

The system was not broken.  People lose money all the time in the stock market. Whole life saving as a matter of fact.  Companies go under.  It's life in capitalism.  No one steps up to help the 'small investors'.  Free market until the big fish start losing?  Too big to fail? 

Selling 140% should be criminal for both the Hedge fund, the brokers, and the clearing houses.  But it's legal...  

It was a stupid position for the Hedge fund(s) to put themselves in.  People took advantage of it.  Basic capitalism.

Manipulation to stop those legal transaction appears to be collusion and highly illegal.
Why broker can I buy GME from the UK? Trading 212 stopped buys and Revolut left my buy order pending with no way to cancel for over eight hours yesterday missing the days trade completely.
They act like we don’t know what RISK is.
Nobody loses money buying shares. They only lose money when they sell below their cost price.

What the brokers have done is force people to perhaps lose money (no protection) as they potentially panic sold. And all for the benefit of Wall Street companies who have been pillaging the market forever.
Could you imagine what Trump would be saying if he was still in the Whitehouse ? 

He'd say ""Hey Joe wake your old sleepy ass up and say something ""
Fuck Robinhood, Fuck Hedge Funds, Fuck CNBC, Fuck them all and hope they go straight to hell.
Trading212 is allowing you to buy gme again!
ive held nokia for over 3 years waiting for it to get it's day in the sun. and when people finally take notice that maybe it's undervalued, they halt trading 6 times, block it from being bought the next day, and then block anyone with more than 110 shares / 100 options from buying more. it's so blatant
they didnt stop my losses when i was losing money on stocks. bastards!
It's called, take your money out of the retail game.  I'm not getting bullied. I'd rather sell crack to their kids with that money. 


I was having fun on Robinhood before this happened. Now I'm out.
We should do it again and wait for them to shut another stock down. Further evidence to what we have all been witnessing. We consumers invest, they shut it down for the short seller to take advantage. We expose that these hedge funders own the trading apps and have also been using them to mine our buy data to determine shorting actions. 

Make them whack-a-mole and force them to further expose themselves.
 for real though, people keep talking like the investors were idiots. Blaming the retail investors is akin to saying Nancy Kerrigan ignored the risks of ice skating when Tanya Harding kneecapped her
I know I’m screaming into the abyss here but the reason RH stopped trading was because they are under capitalized and couldn’t cover the buy orders. 

Use a better broker and you won’t have these problems.
That was brutal. I finally felt like I had invested in something good and was ahead and I basically watched it get ripped away. It reminded me of the year I made 40k and didn’t have health insurance I got penalized. I did my taxes and had like 900$ in the bank and owed the government 2k$. I remember thinking to myself “ how the fuck is this possible I am barely surviving” what happened in stocks the past few days was obvious that we can’t allow the billionaires to lose a few bucks so let’s keep fucking the little guy. I pulled everything out of Robinhood and I’d appreciate some advice on a less corrupt one to use.
I’m with Ameritrade.  I own GME.  I tried to set a sell limit order and they decided my limit was too high and wouldn’t accept the trade.  Since when does the broker get to decide what price is too high?  So now I have to sit in front of a terminal all day watching prices to execute on my strategy?  Who makes up the difference between my optimal price and what I get with a manual trade?

It is bullshit and somewhere there will be class actions because this crap is not protecting me from my own stupidity, this crap is ensuring that when I do sell, I’ll sell for less than I could have otherwise got.  That means some hedge fund will lose less than they would have otherwise lost, some hedge fund manager will get to keep his second yacht, and I’ll have to settle for a damn rowboat.

Yeet the rich!
Whack a Mole! 🦫

Shorts will get greedy elsewhere and more opportunities will emerge.

Timing is everything in this Thunderdome!
This is why I don't trust my 401(k) as a retirement plan.  I've known other's that were about to retire in 2008 that had their valuation slashed up to 50% so they had to stay much longer in the workforce than planned.

Wall Street doesn't represent a free capital market.
Change is coming. Investors have become aware of an issue that has plaqued the individual for a long time.
if the billionaire class wanted to avoid the wealth tax that the progessives have been puttin gout there for years... this was not the right move.
Sounds like a case of paper hands
What scares me is that they know they're committing fraud. They know they're breaking the law. They just don't care. 

They know the legal fees and fines from the government will be peanuts compared to the money they would have lost in comparison. 

This is the easiest business decision they've ever had to make.
I think it shows what lies behind all the talk of the free market serving everyone. It’s simply not the case and on the few occasions that it does serve the people the owning class scramble to make sure it doesn’t happen again. This is class warfare in an age where the concept of class struggle has been defamed and made into an abstraction. This is beyond fucked up but also predictable.
Can't let the plebs have a good time
Freetrade app has blocked US stocks on market open, Trading 212 still let's you buy GS2C and GME, dipping into my food money this month just out of spite, +£200 in. Let this shitshow end in peasant triumph
well..at least it's nice to live in a country where this is causing some people to lose sleep :)
What? Were you assuming that free markets are fair?
Please do not tell me you sold.
Some people have pointed this out in other subs but it's most likely the clearing houses that put GME and others on sell only. I'm sure the clearing houses will be happy to let somebody else take the blame though.
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light.
The rich know exactly how to keep wealth all to themselves. Fuck the system
they killed so many, not even GME. AMC, NOK, BB all took hard hits because people could only sell and it just drove the price down
I will participrate in as many stocks as possible and hope its the same as gme
It may be hard to understand, but a good amount of money in the stock market is in regular peoples 401k plans. I don't disagree with your statement overall, but to say it only benefits billionaires until now is largely false. 

Everyone I know who works a shitty corporate job puts $ into their 401K like crazy because they want to retire asap.
Aren't there already class actions against robinhood?
Honestly if this happens we should just start getting mass groups to not buy from specific companies when their stocks rise
Fuck this doom and gloom shit. 

BUY THE DIP

KEEP BUYING WHAT THEY DONT WANT YOU TO BUY. DOWNLOAD FIDELITY APP AND CREATE AN ACCOUNT
I feel bad for my fiancé. He studies so hard and looks at his charts all day, is up at the crack of dawn for the market, etc...and he missed out on GME...but tbf, I’ve been telling him about WSB for years and he refuses to use Reddit...so...I can’t feel TOO bad. Except I have family who used to be anti-stockmarket but was able to buy into GME beginning of the week cause they had the money, whereas we don’t. So you got newbs making money on Reddit but some people who really care about their stocks missed out. Idk. I don’t do stocks, but they’re still an every day part of my life, living with him
It should be a day of enlightenment.  The measures reddit is making is a way to protect against over shorting. And the measures either side takes will eventually even out and become more stable.
SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DONT GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

There were 5000 trades of 1000 shares. Those were not Redditors. The big boys are cannibals.
I may be the odd one out, but seems like people are raking the weekend to setup new accounts on more credible exchanges like fidelity. 

Hedge funds are still probably shorting, but amazingly GME is still at 325$

I see one more final push come next week.
The media wants you to believe that we are the bad guys. We are dangerous. We are going to upend the stock market. Nah. You know what will: when none of the little guys trust the market to give them a fair shot anymore. If these buy restrictions continue I think that will do more damage than we ever could.
Well this shit is going to start revolt against the stock market I guarentee that. They couldn't stop me from winning or losing my savings ape wanted banana ape got banana. 33 shares of AMC and more of NOK and carnival cruise tommorow. I'm holding my one share of gme for dear life this is my share there is no other share like it but its mine.
Something I’ve learned in this world. If it seems to complicated, it’s because someone is trying to hide the simplicity from you.

But on the bright side, think of the unity that could become now that millions more have lived and witnessed first hand the rigged game. We all knew it was rigged, but for most of us it never touched close to home. Well, now it’s right on our doorstep. The next trendy string of riots aren’t going to be about social justice or counting ballots if they fumble this one...
Everyday since hedge funds are manipulating the price on all wsb stocks down.  Isn’t it illegals to manipulate stock prices with ladder selling?
How is this post ranked top 10 all time on my feed? From the grammar to the content, idk wtf homie trynna say. Maybe I’m just sleepy n dumb, idk.
Wait?!?!?! What did i miss?
We will hold the line, nobody sell GME please.
This isn't something new. They've been doing this for some time. Robinhood and Webull halt rising stocks and prevent you from doing anything until the price dips. Likely controlled by corrupt individuals.
Seriously how hard is it to fucking get off ROBINHOOD and go to a real brokerage like Fidelity where this wasn't a problem at all? Use a shitty broker, have shitty issues. 

I'm surprised you guys were even able to log in honestly
Of course Robinhood cut you out, after all your NOT their customer, you pay zero fees.  Any service (google, Facebook, etc) that you use for free, you ARE the product being sold.

Any savvy investor knows Robinhood makes their money by selling retail investor trade info to hedge funds and other players so they can take advantage of it.

You really think they are going to piss for their real customers? Don’t act so shocked, you wanted something for nothing...you got what you paid for.

You realize people are going to crash actual indexes for the lols

You think your gambling money and your investment money don’t touch?
They will get what’s coming. Fucking criminals.
As an economist, what’s so infuriating is a large group of retail investors shouldn’t be able to potentially make a greater impact on the entire stock market. 

This is completely ridiculous what happen here today, people HAVE to go to prison this time.
WE LIKE THE STOCK! Hold retards
""Normal"" investors are being used as a battering ram by a select few. Most normal investors don't understand what they're actually doing and are just participating for the memes. WSB are using bottom rung traders to make it out of this with a lot of money, and will leave all the ""normies"" hanging in the  wind. The truth hurts.
and it aint over!
What the fuck, this typo piece of dung is the upvoted choice of this sub?  

God damn, I hope no one who matters reads this.  Embarrassing.  

Seriously, how the F is this at 15k upvotes?  Is this satire?

ThE rulling class has ben putt on nowtice
Let's be a little more clear.  The issue isn't that they stopped people from 'participating.'  The stock was being manipulated.  They were right to shut down trading on it.

The issue is they only stopped SOME people from manipulating the stock, and didn't shut it ALL down.

Let's not pretend Reddit wasn't pumping and dumping the stock through manipulation.  No one's out here thinking GameStop has a great future.  So tired of this propaganda bullshit.
I’m really sad today. I got on the hype train about unfair practices and evil billionaires, and then I read like three articles.  Liquidity and clearing houses  are actual things that have to be considered. Places like RobinHood and That bull app are not made of infinite amounts of money, nor can they directly use cash transactions to open more positions. There are regulations on trading companies and how they use their money. Does RobinHood have to go bankrupt so jack the mechanic can use his 3000 nest egg on the gamble that his coworkers swear by? Does free market really mean pushing platforms like Rh out of existence? 

I wish there wasn’t such a stupid hive mind on this website.
I’m down on NOK.....
The stock marker crash of 2020 comes to mind
This brought to light how rigged the system is. When the big guys who are SUPPOSED to win, finally lose to us retailers THEY CHANGE THE RULES!! FUCK THOSE CHEATERS, NOW IT'S ABOUT REVENGE🐍🐍 🚀🚀🚀

I LIKE THE STOCK.
> lost money having no idea what they were doing 

Example I like to use - the kid from Philly who at 12-13 years old, using his little allowance, managed to kick off his own clothing brand by basically peddeling and using social media until it caught the right eyes. Kid isn't even 16 and is a millionaire. Kid without any prior capital nor some expensive, higher education. If a kid can figure something like this out, so can lots and lots of others instead of moaning how hedge funds fuck them over by manipulating stocks they nor own nor ever even heard of. 

&#x200B;

And if we're referring to the same poor people who are, poor, because buying lottery tickets or sitting through a paycheck in a casino is their idea of investment or hopeful fun, well.....
This has to be a plant. Worst spelling ever wtf.

How did you spell participate ""partecipate"" not once, but twice?

Do you actually think the word is partecipate?
[deleted]
idk man I think once this happened and prices started falling, the move was to just cut your losses and buy back the stock when it hits the floor and they unlock it  

these guys  

this is starting to piss me off  

okay, reddit, it turns out you can only fuck with the big boys, but you can kill one if you want to  

back off, don't turn this armed robbery into a murder  

now that you know you can do it, and if you're serious about fighting the good fight– or hell, just making a bigger profit *in the future*– you need to take today's money, run, and learn from what happened so that next time you can actually do some serious damage while profiting *immensely* off of it.  

This week has been a tremendous proof of concept, don't waste it by losing all of your money, discouraging everyone from trying again, and forcing the Wall Street-owned Congress to prevent something like this from ever happening again by regulating services like Robinhood.  

Something to think about.  

and buy AMC when it hits the floor and hold it until movies *actually* start coming out, you fucking idiots quit selling it all because while it's probably not going to hit $20 in November, it could get to somewhere between $10 and $15 and that's a good payoff for $5 or even $8 come on man think long-term what are you even doing
I'd say the opposite, media outlets are finally picking up on it, and get the attention of decision-makers in DC
Haha speak for yourself, today was an awesome day in the market for me.
Remember when France had a revolution?

Look where they are now.

It's always been known who controls the market. Why y'all crying about it now? Profits over people abolish ameriKKKa
In the end this will bring about massive government regulations on everyone.  The biggest thing they will and should do will be rules on naked shorts and blocking naked call selling without underlying shares.
lots of fucking emotional trading going on

DONT TRADE WITH YOUR EMOTIONS wasnt that a rule in this game??
Ok
Cut their fucking heads off!
BUY BUY BUY WE ARE ABOUT TO HIT OPEN ON GME
Let's call it  
  
POWER TO THE PLAYERS.
Drop  your amc positions idiots. short interest wasn't even close to high  enough and that was before the covering. AMC IS A DISTRACTION. Check the short interest from Ortex (week free subscription) if you don't believe me. It's nothing like GME!! Use your heads and don't follow the crowd or you will be bagholding....

Dark Day? The cut you out? You think they want you to stop trading? My goodness, you fucks need to really get over yourselves. Wall Street, RH, etc are not out to get you people. The needed stability on the platform and to mitigate risk. 

Sucks when a FREE platform tries to make risk management decisions and gets blasted by clueless people.
Is it actually that’s serious? I didn’t gamble in any of those pump and dump stocks since that’s not how I like to invest but I was glad to here some people made money off of them.

Lets call this event. GAMESTONK.
funny how Wednesday trading was halted, what, 3 -4 times on the way up... but not halted Thursday on the way down ,, then again I eat crayons
is this everyone's first time in the market? do you have any idea how stocks are cleared? that's rhetorical you don't. there is no conspiracy. if you want to get paid for all your paper gains at some point then shutting down trading in these names is necessary. look up depository trust company. they clear most transactions and set collateral requirements. the collateral requirements usually are low(2-3%) for most names, it's 100% for the WSB names. there is financial risk for you guys holding these names in that you may sell but in 3 days when the cash is supposed to go to you, you may get nothing. why do you think the banks got bailed out in 2008-2009? they took the other side of the trade to enable stocks to clear. The DTC isn't capitalized enough to take the risk on these names so they make it impossible to trade them in large amounts.

I hope that it finally becomes clear to more people that this is what Capitalism is. The game is and always was rigged, with the state and legislation, usually controlled by the biggest players, being an integral part of it.

Is that statistic on retail investors losing money accurate?
Sort of unrelated but, could one live off of pure investments till they die? Assuming it was done “correctly” like Roth IRA, Stocks, Assets?, I’m a noob if you couldn’t tell but yeah..
It serious bullshit.   We go to war on a completely uneven battle field with the pretense of equality.   We then beat them with the game and that’s an issue.    🤬
Sucks. My dumbass only ever used Robinhood, and though I've been working to get WeBull set up, it seems that they manually verify accounts, so I am sitting her missing out on the fun. My 1k ain't much, but I want to add it to the cause.
So many people got to pay off their student loans because of this gamble. Now, they want to take it away from them.
So what can we do about this? Would it make sense for all retail users to completely pull out of the stock market cause we can get boned like this? I doubt that’s the answer but what can we do (besides buy GME) to prevent this from happening?
r/theunityproject
HOOLLLLDDD

BUY MORE GME

FUCK WALLSTREET

It’s not about the money anymore, make a stand!
Question:  Fidelity ""Pending cancel""'ed my $200 market order for GME that I placed just after open this morning for a partial share. Is this fishy or is it just because of price fluctuation? Should I be concerned?
I'm calling it the Gamestop Rebellion!
there major collusion for sure and likely, but don't discount there was also serious potential issues of liquidity and complete market meltdown. one or both of these is true. 

a clearing house and DTC funds your trade. the trade doesn't actually go into the clearing house and DTC until 3 days later. 

so when you buy a $100 stock you pay the clearing house or DTC $100. they in turn pay the seller $100 immediately, but have to wait 3 days to cash your $100. 

they have to have funds to funds the transaction. they are claiming they ran out of funds or were afraid of the risk that they wouldn't eventually get your $100. 

DTC began requiring 100% funds to back up trades for certain stocks because of how volatile the tradng has been and were worried about a co-party crash (Melvin > Citadel > DTC). 

clearing houses couldn't fund it 100% (or claimed they couldn't) so they cut off trade completely.
Vladimir can go eat a donkey dick!
Utter bs. Unfortunately I don’t anything will come from this and that’s just based on my trust of the system in place. But I do think and hope we the people might have an opportunity to punish them ourselves. Not using their apps/platforms and such. Such a small thing that could carry some weight.
$GME and $AMC will rally for 1 more day. Tomorrow. Get in if you can. By taking away the option to trade stock, brokers have effectively cut back on supply (or let’s say, availability) tremendously. The stock market, like any other economic principle, works on supply and demand. If supply outweighs demand, prices go down and if demand is greater than supply, there’s money to be made. Robinhood has 13 million users alone, and they are not the only ones who have barred trading. This is 13+ million people who cannot access these stocks, and they are quite upset about it, which means they bloody well want it. GME and AMC will rally tomorrow. Monday’s tell all factor will be whether brokers lift the ban or not. Until they do, I’m holding AMC with nearly my entire portfolio. Why? Because demand will increase and supply cannot until these bans are lifted. Even if the price doesn’t jump much tomorrow because of this, as long as these brokers keep bans on, they will lose users. Once they’ve had enough of that, they will lift the ban and send GME and AMC to the moon once again. You heard it here first.
I honestly understand how the capital raider felt.
Just a little bit now.I want action, there needs to be consequences but there won’t be.
Learn a thing or two about order routing. The brokers down today had no where to clear new buy orders
How much they cut us out?
I’m in BB 972 shares @23.50 a share and holding
It was the beginning of the short squeeze. They were covering their ass because they don't have enough shares to cover positions. So they had to halt buying because if you already don't have enough, selling more is illegal.
So when are we going to new york to take a stand ?
I've never been so angry, like I made some money on all this, but I've never been so angry about making money in my life and I'm not sure I ever will be to this level again. It's really not about the money anymore it's about sending a message. Wall street is worse than the mafia and both are run by criminals who cheat. Just an awful awful day and I'm so bitter
I hope the fallout isn’t no option trading for normal nonrich people. That’s almost the takeaway I get from Warren despite her in theory being against hedge funds.
Well we don't have free markets and we never have. While left leaning folks like to point to our system to showcase the failures of free markets the reality is our capitalism has nothing to do with free markets and this is yet another example. It is a system owned and rigged by the elite for the elite.
in other news, $doge is up 700%
but if we buy and hold they and just keep selling and fourth to eachother, plus people will buy tmrw americans will find a new robin hood
It's another dark day for the U.S. citizens, I would say.
I just wanna know if I buy some gme stock will I make money? Lol I downloaded robin hood earlier in the month and bought a few cheap stocks, figured I'd get in on this hype before its too too late.

How were ""normal people"" making money on GME?
I know it's a meme but...if you've ever read A Random Walk Down Wall Street, he does an incredible job exposing all the hacks and manipulation done by Wall Street over the past 100 years. It's basically the whole first 1/3 of the book

nothing has changed

Anyone know if Questrade blocked any trades?
No it wont go down as anything. Books and history will be rewritten, the goal post moved and truth bend.

Thats what is going to happen.
These is just the end of a new begging... I’ve never seen something like that.

GME 🚀🚀
I propose this event be referred to as The Reckoning
Wait, what happened to my currency?

- Norwegian Guy
I lost 5k because Trading212 didn’t tell me that I was using CFDs, other than a little label in the corner of the screen
How is this legal? 

&#x200B;

I mean in the stock market you  can lose, and it looks like it protected a particular team from losing. Sounds like a rigged game.

&#x200B;

I play stocks often and am successful, but this seems illegal to say the least.
Can someone ELI5 wtf happens to the value of the share when the billionaires covering shorts, calls, etc no longer have the solvency to sell you the share or call?

Like for real.. I'm terrified, not so much for myself as I only have enough skin in this that I can afford to lose, but the millions of peasants like myself that have gone yolo all in.. Wtf happens to the value of the shares you own when the guys selling them to you go bust??
This is also an opportinuty: we need to have a decentralized exchanhe available to us. No one to stop trades when things go against billionaires and hedge funds, no overseeing power to change things if needed.
It is not a dark- it is a Day of Reckoning!!!!!!!!!!!
No memeing, I got a robinhood account yesterday. If I buy a single share of GME what are the chances I make anything off it now?
isn't gamestop the company where you can trade in 10games for 10$ rebate?
They can't cut us out. I told a fellow friend who was in GME when it wss tanking that this trade lock wpn't last. They will be forced to remove it or get sued and eventually, the stock will rise again. Not even a full day later and the stock is already back to $400. Just a few days ago, it was $25 when I first brought GME and now it's $400. This is the power of the market and it will not be held back by little bitch hedge funds.
I am not a stock trader or even interested in this. But if I hear about this in my local news and economists here are worried about this (I live in Sweden btw), then something is going on.
Those of us using Trading 212 actually had a whole 1/2 trading day where we were PROHIBITED from buying OR EVEN SELLING our shares in GME. They tell us it's because they use Interactive Brokers as an Intermediary and they stopped it. so not only screwing the whole strategy, but they actually proved they can stop us from even selling our shares.
Hey man, im here to welcome you all to Decentralized finance.

Time to put the power back to our hands
#Billionaires Lives Matter
Yup, bought BB and the next day the stock crashed because they barred people from buying more shares. Down over 85% in a single day cuz of this
I honestly don’t grasp exactly what is going on. I do know billionaires are getting screwed. Will it effect others stocks as well, like those who have retirement investments ? I do not want to screw over grandma, I do want to screw over people with 9 yachts that don’t pay taxes...
Interactive Brokers still restricting trades on these tickers.

I know robinhood has a class action lawsuit but what about one for Interactive Brokers?
What are the odds of shorting some of the stocks people will be liquidating to cover their losses?
China does this. Are we China now?
Agree in principle, but I think they did it to protect themselves. Any hedge fund declaring bankruptcy means that the broker is now on the hook for any short that hedge fund did through them. Trade halting means that this is a real risk now. They were fucked whatever they did, so they chose to kill their brand rather than the entire company.
Write to your congressperson.
It should be called Market’s closed (idea from Pool’s closed)
When Abbie Hoffman and his group of yippies threw hundreds of one dollar bills to the floor of the exchange,  the greedy traders couldn’t help themselves. Trading was halted because everyone was scrounging the floor, trying grab the money. Shortly after the exchange put glass barriers between the gallery and the floor, because they realized next time the people wouldn’t be throwing money at them, but rather, taking it from them.
They protected the rich from the poor, this has been going on for generations in some form or fashion. They are scared because there are more of us, and this time we hit where it hurts, their wallets.
Don't stop here. This is the real revolution. The curtain has been pulled aside and were seeing who is running this machine.
The time has come my brothers and sisters,

The enemy they must pay with their dollars,

Let our sons and daughters chant our valour,

For losses and wealth we are soldiers,

We shall win,

Or fall with pride with a gleeful grin,

Let them not forget what we've done today,

Let them weep and run in dismay,

Stand your ground children of now,

Till the end we shall never bow.
I just wish all this happened before an election.

So I'm coming in late with a partial understanding of what has been occuring. I am pretty simple with respect to investing (401, Roth, 529, and some individual stocks) I.e. no options/shorting etc. 

What can I do to help stick it to these assholes today and tomorrow with my fidelity brokerage account? Anything?
I don't k owe anything about stocks and what he means. Can someone please explain?
That letter from Robinhood was garbage. “Today was a tough day...”.  

Halting trading due to volatility is within their rights. Halting ONLY buying? That’s shady.
They were choosing between bankruptcy and risking prison... They chose to risk prison rather than give up their tendies and it didn't even work... APES TOGETHER STRONG

Be sure to tell everyone about what's happening too.  Many outside of the internet or away from News wont know what's going on. This needs to be widely known by everyone! The people found a way to Hurt the elites and the government is blatantly showing us they are not on the side of the people!
Lest not forget the amount of people that are mad about GME. If it was only 1 billionaire the others would have laughed because they only care about themselves. But I'm starting to think a whole fuck ton of them are loosing. Maybe upwards of half a trillion. Maybe even more I hope.
With world wide retail investors we will win some ground today 🎉. January 29 - 2021 will be a day to remember, be it either winning al back or the first day on way back up. You expect some tricks from the 🤡 and the masses will get their 💵. **BlackBerry is still undervalued**. Do not sell. You only loose money when you sell. BB & GME are going to the moon en beyond 🚀🚀🚀

It is unfair that the he who pays the Piper gets to chose the tune. As those who use Robin Hood have discovered there is no 'free' lunch. The established players have big fat accounts which pay the Pipers.  
The little guys can go after the the platforms for consequential losses. Just remember how the smart money laughed at the Hertz affair a few months ago....
This is how the wealth inequality gap moves further apart
This is the beginning of the end of centralised finance. Will take some years, but good fucking riddance
Make no mistake someone did the math and calculated that even after all the lawsuits and class actions they are still saving money by stopping the markets.  That's how big this thing is.
RobinHood is fucked. 

Close to 80% of their customers originated from Reddit or friends of Reddit. 

They are going to lose a huge class action lawsuit that will destroy any profits they made.

There is a chance they will be shut down by the FTC. 

This company is going to disappear with this one illegal decision to protect some billionaire buddies.
They tell us to stay in and work from home. Once we do, they do everything to make us stop. These old fucks are on there way out, and all us autistic apes can take charge
Today is the day America stopped supporting a free market.
For a quick profit.  Wise to buy some GME now and sell later today?  Predictions?
It's time we moved to decentralized, permissionless platforms. These already exist and move millions of dollars of volume and also generate millions in fees.
\*participate
Good thing the ancient Malians didn't do this.
Lol Brokers have always been scammy. That's why trading is hard. You are trying to beat other traders/ the market as well as the brokers.
Don't have much to play with but I used Public to grab $100 worth of GME this a.m. Even losing that would be worth it. I'll help where I can even if it amounts to very little.
Lmfaooooooooo
Can someone please explain this in plain English, for someone who doesn't know squat about investing?
It’s surprising and saddenig that what robinhood did is a thing. I hope that a scandal like this shreds their brand permanently and leads to them being crushed by their competitors.
I can't trust any of the brokerages that limited my trading any more. The only apps I had that stayed 100% open were Grifin and Cash app
💎👐
💎👐
Hi new to all this I have $$$ and time. I wanna help hold these billionaires accountable. I'm looking to find what platform I can use to buy stock if any right now. I've heard so much about trades being blocked on platforms like robinhood. I have enough for maybe a few AMC and one GME. I'm terrified to throw money at all this and every forum I've been on has been like ""Don't ask these kind of questions."" Wondering if anyone would be willing to reach out to me and explain how to get on this train. Here's hoping this doesn't get deleted and someone see's it. I really just need to know what app or platform I should be using during this sh\*t storm.
My ROBINHOOD account was “throttled”‘after it crashed.  I was unable to trade all day or access any human being at ROBINHOOD. I’m not comfortable trading with a brokerage company that has no licensed brokers or anyone to take a damn phone call or email!!! I hate Andrew Left and what he’s allowed to do. This action by traders to send a message to short traders definitely worked but WSB don’t want us in the club folks!!!
This marks history
🚀🚀🚀
I’m a Gen X and looking to retire in 15 years. Despite what this might do to my lifeline pension I stand up and applaud the filthy animals that are showing the institution that the times they are a changin’. Kudos, it has put a smile on my face and I hope it works. Just remember they have a knack of working out how to get more money out of a situation and morals mean nothing to them just money. Don’t just make today’s play to cost them billions think about their responses and how to respond to those too, that’s how you’ll beat them.
Going forward what brokers should be blacklisted?
lol imagen
If nothing else theres a new narrative now so this will end up being a new day for the little guys and you can bet the fat cats are very aware of this.
How did they shut us out?
Hold.
Yet people still don’t realize how the system is rigged towards Wall St and not retailers. Even if it crash Wall St get bailouts and retailers don’t.

A way to stop them is simply to stop playing the game.
We’re going to make them pay for all of this greatly. The day may be dark now but when this squeeze kicks in it’s going to be brighter than the receiving end of the Death Stars laser
To be fair, now that they explained why, I understand.

Why they kept us in the dark? I’ll never know.  That was an extremely short sighted idea that will destroy their company.
Stop-gaps were put in place after the 2008 crash to shut down not only individual stocks but the whole market if things get too crazy. It was triggered a couple times in March last year when the pandemic really took off. Its a way to prevent 2008 from happening again or worse: a really real Great Depression part 2 where everyones  unemployed, not because of laziness or lack of skill/education, but because there are no businesses left to provide jobs to people and no capital to invest because the capital evaporated.  

It can always be worse. But it needs to get better; for everyone not just a few.
FROM THIS DAY FORTH THE EVENT WILL NAMED 
'THE GME EVENT'
The Wall Street Clash of 2021
Anyone knows about the time that RATM out on a concert in wall street and managed to shut it off mid-day? Yeah. Let's do that.
If it dips this afternoon should I buy some? I’m late to the game.
Shouldnt those robinhood fucks get punished for what they did? They got buthurt and packed up their shit and left
F7
Anyone know how to transfer an entire portfolio from Robinhood to another brokerage?
I am considering pulling out of my 401ks and taking the tax hit.  I already didn't trust the market and feel uneasy about my savings being tied to something volatile.  I'd kind of rather just not participate at all.  All the enthusiasm on reddit to buy and hold is not making me feel any better about it.
Why people are not talking about buying SPCE (81.53% shorted) which is #2 on the most shorted list.?

They are mostly talking about GME (138% shorted) and AMC (68.93% shorted) which are #1and #3 resp.
Wipeout Wednesday?  Retail Thursday? 

How about we call it what it is...Oppression! 

All I know is that they have awoken a beast.   After the dust settles here, we wait for them to try it again.  Try betting against an American business hurting because of a downed economy. We will be waiting.  5million strong...and we all like the same stocks 🥴
I know first hand a small group of brokers meet annually to decide what to pump n dump

>In the last generation most of the people thought about the stock market as something abstract and only reserved to the richest getting richer, only having a clue about what Wall Street is thanks to movies.

I'm going to make an assumption and say this was written by a Millennial.

That ""last generation"" would be Gen X and we didn't come from some archaic era. The stock market was never ""abstract"". Heck I remember learning to read stock prices from newspapers. 

Yes newspapers used to publish the prior day prices. 

Many of us grew up during the 80s and saw the stock market discussed every day on the nightly news. We SAW the rise of wealth under Reagan. We DO know what ""trickle down economics"" actually implies because we lived thru the context of it. 

Yes the stock market was rather reserved for those who were ""rich"" because it took money to get an account at a brokerage firm. If you didn't have $40K or more, firms wouldn't even let you in the door. 

With technology advances and Wall St greed, those barriers were broken down by the 90s, allowing your average person to enter the stock market. 

But make no mistake, Boomers, Gen X weren't some ignorant uneducated group sitting on the sidelines and getting their info from the movies.

Games are a huge industry, but gamestop is worthless; now this.

😂
I think you'd need to be a complete piece of shit to support these  hedgefund managers and it's clear as day that the impetus for the  trading platform freezes was quid pro quo and not consumer protection,  but I am \*genuinely\* concerned about what this will do to the average  retail investor. I'm worried this will turn into a pyrrhic ""victory"", where retail investors will get to bloodlet hedgefunds with a penchant for market manipulation and shorting but also suffer crippling losses.

I love people-watching on reddit, and it's heart-breaking to see how many  people are joining into this frenzy as a type of ideological warfare against wallstreet, without any target price or end in sight. I think the issue isn't what redditors are doing per se, but what hedgefunds can  legally perform and the anger retail investors feel over the asymmetry.  Hedge funds already have every advantage possible in the book, and it's  \*still\* not enough for them when the retail world bites back. And if upwards circuit breakers or mandatory holding periods were established beforehand by regulation meant to curb bubbles then it would be a different story instead of this clear, arm's length bullshit between trading apps and wallstreet, so I get the fury...

But ultimately, we have the modern-day equivalent to late-2000s blockbuster stock and the mother fucker was about to pierce 500USD until it was  derailed by bad-faith trading platforms. I'm not for paternalism,  especially when applied asymmetrically, but I am sad for a lot of retail investors that are refusing to sell no matter what and since retail investors cannot coordinate their exit in the same way colluding hedgefunds can, you can be sure there'll be a bloodbath \*at some point\*. I just think too many redittors take it literally when people say a stock is worth whatever it's being sold for...
Don't forget about Black Wall Street in Tulsa in the 1920's too.
It’s almost like the foundational system is inherently flawed. Like it will always do this? Like it’s unstable inherently? Like it’s designed to be corrupted and for hegemonic power groups to form?

Hmm...
We can also buy GameStop products to boost their revenue
Insurrect Wall Street.
Screenshot me in the history books
I'm still trying to understand why they disabled the buy button, as in like a good explanation . Like all these broker are just beating around the punch with the same format of an excuse.

They were better of just disabling the buy and sell  rather than having one option in the hedge favour. How is it ""protecting"" the client when they can only sale. 

Like when I lost 7k in CFD, I didn't see no broker holding my hand telling me, I'm here to protect you, don't buy this, don't sell that! 

None all of a sudden, they taken matter into their hands, cause the house is not winning. 

That's not a free market! That's manipulation!
I wasnt going to buy but after seeing that I bought some. Its pretty much about principle at this point.
I think that this is going to open a lot of eyes to the realization that capitalism is, indeed, nothing else but the exploitation of normal day people through the upper class.

I am aware that a lot of people basically were always aware of that fact, but there has also always been a general denial for the sake of our own mental health in that regard... but no longer.

People are starting to realize that they are just pawns and second class citizens to some f\*cked up billionaires and their hedge funds.
Yes, chronologically is usually how history books are sorted.
It’s not over... when I buy GME, hold, and *SQUEEEZE* then they have to answer to *ME* the retail investor.
Question. How do you invest as foreigner? I can't seem to find any international brokerage online.
Question of the day:

What do you put the true value of AMC at?

I've got a valuation of around 3$, previously lower of course, but they did just wipe around 600m of their debt. Debt is still huge of course (5.2 billion approx), and cashflow is increasingly  negative in these covid times.

Streaming trend is against them as well. Seems an obvious candidate to place a negative delta spread on. Am I missing something?
Shorting should be illegal, i just learned what that is now cuz i dont own stocks, always wanted but seemed to complicated to trade
To clarify: they didn't stop all activity on the stocks ($GME and $AMC); they ONLY stopped users from being able to buy.  They were more than happy to allow selling, because that's what benefits the hedge funds.

Crony capitalism at its finest.  Imagine how much better the decisions by these companies might be if they were allowed to fail.  They take big risks & screw the rest of us if it goes south.

I'm a huge fan of capitalism, but this isn't it....
Retail investing was around way before robinhood. What exactly was new about them? A snazzy mobile app?
I don't use Robin Hood, so I gotta ask....Are any of you who do use it moving your accounts?   


If you don't, it's kind of an all-talk-no-action situation.
I'm not connected to media much so I'm not sure of what happened here in the recent days regarding all of this and what I'm seeing headlines about. Can someone give me a brief synopsis and the significance of the event (aside from what was pointed out in the OP's post)?

Thanks!
How do I join the group of redditors that drove GME up.
black Friday 2020
It’s not over yet
While I might not agree that there was no potential out there for retail, I do agree that this was 110% an inside job.  F ROBUNHOOD and their downpayment issue with the clearing house.
If that’s truly their issue then they need to admit they are a subpar trading site meant for novice investors with $5g or less liquid cap to invest.

Robinhood was super-beneficial for the average retail investor....  until it wasn’t.  Go figure.


No really RH, go figure it out.   Or Billions are going to quickly transition to sites you forced into free trades, that can actually handle VOLATILITY without shitting themselves.

I wonder what warren buffets thoughts are on all of this?
Hi. 
My jcpenney stock is now listed as 679535104 and I can’t sell anymore. 

Is this related to what’s going on? Or did they finally go bankrupt even though I’m in the green. Do I lose all this money? ... how? :(

Thanks for any help
Probably need to recall all the senator who turned a blind eyes on this, regardless the party.
Yes, and GME doesn’t have the fundamentals to back the price. Without the short squeeze possibility, it just doesn’t make sense.

I traded for the first time mere weeks ago. And sure, I lost a little money (about $60) but I didn’t put much in either. Nothing that I absolutely needed. But I’m still glad I did it. It has got my foot In the door and I’ve been learning a lot of new things. It’s crazy to me that people have used up their savings or take out mortgages. I’d love to get rich sure but I realize it isn’t going to happen over night. If I got an extra $20 now I might throw it in a stock I like. I’d really like to buy so pot stock, Coinbase and roblox when they join the market and solar. If I make an extra hundo at some point I’ll be happy.  
Just putting random thoughts here. Thanks for reading.
They should be in prison,if it were us we would be.

Yes, I heard of this already
I bought 86 CGEN, for price around 10$ for each. Hoping that they rebound, to 13$ for each (price was 13$ at 8th February, and it falled to 10$ just in 1 day). And around 2-3 days after way to the sky started... Not for a long, tho. That shit catched poor CGEN in middle of flight, at 11.2$ and bring down to 8.5-9.5$ price.

Is this pertaining to rh and other companies restricting trading

Just saw this is over a month ago
It's a rigged game friend, buy some phsical silver and gold! Stack on!

I can confirm that you can still buy GME on TD. I just bought 1 more for $149.28 or market at the time.  I now have 3011 shares🦍🚀
I am in the same boat..I am looking for AMC to hit $60
Stock dip, many sell off 😭😭 me loses money
The brokerage firms own the casino...they can do what they please, the idea of a free market is false.
y’all niggas look stupid looking back. every trading platform does what robinhood did.
When it gets really bad, the governments close all the world’s markets. They did on me for ten days in 1969. I was long gold at $35 an ounce on 95% margin through shares in marginal  gold mines. They had a G10 meeting in Stockholm for ten days and announced gold would be $35 an ounce forever.  When the markets opened Monday week, I lost five years trading profits. My friend, who had less leverage, held on and retired in 1975.
My money my choice... or is it?
Agreed
My dark day is near [when it feel like giving up but,…](https://www.redgifs.com/watch/humbleilliteratesapsucker)
I figured it must have been illegal, its weird they can offer a service like this with no regulations.  Can a payday lender stop you from paying back your loan so they can keep charging interest?
No sell option? Well that was a 5 min glitch, sorry. Oh the market tanked. Sorry.

At the same time? Yeah, we know.
I hate msm for twisting this bc it is fucking huge.
Happened to me with Enron. Watched it go down day after day and couldn’t sell...
They also canceled people's orders and SOLD people's stocks without their consent when the price peaked at 460. From a legal standpoint had these brokers not gotten involved the stock price could be at 600-700 right now. So people who bought in at 300, 400 lost their money as well as any potential gains. So there is no way to fully calculate the damage that they caused to retail investors and you could argue their loses are technically infinite
Maybe. But as the post above pointed out this may not have been at the behest of brokerages, it could be from the clearing houses and it could be because they breached an internal risk metric that prevents them from failing to execute the contracts as written. There might be some regulatory actions at play here.
I'm not from the US, wanted to get into stocks but then this happened. I've watched so many videos on it but I can't make sense of it and I'm fine with that. I have food, water, warmth and soon a small garden. I don't even care anymore
Has the legality of Robin Hood's move been determined? As far as I know that is still an open question, and looking bad for the company.
I think people are getting spooked and it’s pretty ridiculous they can just keep bringing down the market instead of just letting these few funds implode.
Thing is it's not legal how they did it. 

Trading halts all the time from volatility, but it's usually to let thing die down and make sure there's no foul play.

I've never ever seen trading only be allowed to go one way. That is MASSIVELY ILLEGAL. Robin hood And the others are gonna face a reckoning for that one.
Yeah it did scare me and I started to invest this year. I'll probably pull off every investment from the american markets and put it elsewhere. Wallstreet obviously has too much influence on who wins and losses with these stocks.
Its sad that now you have to find an honest brokage firm. What firms are doing this. Its time to change where you do business.
Stop drawing this comparison. It’s nothing alike. You can go post your hate speech anywhere you want on the internet. You can only trade securities in brokerages that have to follow basic rules like not blatantly manipulate the market. Stop using this opportunity to spread your propaganda.
I guess the future is decentralized Stock Market (or Brokerage firm). Idk if that makes sense, i am pretty new to this.
Agreed.
I think I’ll get into european stocks from now on.
Why should I/would I ever consider a managed fund again? They aren't there to make us money, they give us just enough of a cut to keep us docile.

If we try to take care of ourselves they fuck us through collusion with brokers...

The stock market is the facade of a fake building and behind that is a house of cards held together by illegal practices, shadow pools, and enough accounting tricks to make sure we stay in the shit.
watch the ""cancel culture"" enter the stock world

you heard it hear first!
They can't legally stop a stock from being traded. But the cost of breaking the law is nothing to them.
fuck it, if these were pitchfork days i'd be sharpening mine. they're all a bunch of bandits
we're getting off of the shitty brokers that stopped trades. this was mostly on RobinHood. other brokers restricted trades by requiring higher requirements on margin purchases (100%) etc. RobinHood just blatantly held us hostage and let Citadel cover their shorts. 

&#x200B;

Robinhood is dead. anybody staying in the platform after this event is done is just enabling them.
This does indeed appear like a lose-lose situation for Wall Street. They temporarily defused the bomb, yet defusing it activated another, bigger bomb.
The core good thing that has come out of this, is that we can see which firms have NOT stopped selling GME.

The snakes are all out in the open, just avoid them now.

After this fiasco, only a complete idiot will use anything but those that didn't block.

**FYI: Trading 212 is still blocking, but they make it look like they aren't.**

**You can reach the buy menu, drag to a single share, and then it will tell you 0 is the maximum allowed.**
Not saying I would have sold GME if I could have... but I was blocked from selling my GME when it hit $420 because ALLY wouldn’t let me even see my account to buy or sell anything.... now instead of profiting about 20k and paying off about 1/5 of my student loans I’m holding just a little in the red.
Use Fidelity, not Robinhood.
I'm not in GME, but I do have a nice position in BB.  I've already transferred the funds to buy the fucking dip in the morning!  You don't shave 40% off of one of my positions with no underlying fundamental changes to the company and think I'm not going to BUY THE FUCKING DIP!!!
I hope tomorrow is better. I got positions in all those and didn’t sell today. My account went from 27k premarket to 14k quick.
Bro wtf happens if GME issues more stock? Is It game over for us retails? The shorts can cover their positions underwater with those?
Hot but unfortunately unavailable for me at least.

Rakuten is the most popular platform in Japan and it has stopped buys of GME.
AMC is barely breathing. My advice is to cut and run.
I too shall see you in Valhalla brother
>When the dust settles, the people WILL rise. We are the legion that HF managers hate. We do not tire, we will not rest and we shall drink to victory in Valhalla.
Im 3 days late, you hit the nail on the head. More people need to read that last sentence.

HOLD THE LINE!!!! 💎👐💎👐💎👐💎👐
I hope so as well, but what's to stop then from doing the old ladder trick forever until the share price is $5 and they cut their losses? No one is stopping them from pushing the price down and not allowing us to buy... 🖐️💎 🖐️ But I can't keep the price from going down.
Or after the Fimbulwinter, at Ragnarok.
also many brokers are saying 'we did this to protect you from volatility' 

like the wtf man, it's not like when we lose money you say 'oh little child, you are not making tendies... here, take 1k$ as a bonus'
This is literally how ive felt all day

Here is my question....

What happens if a lot of very large hedgefunds go bankrupt tomorrow?  What does this cause across the market?

We know a lot of funds and the game is rigged, it was proved today.  We know a lot of this is corrupt beyond measure and that these people are the shittest humans ever that only play when the game is unfair and take the ball and go home when they can't control the outcome.

But here is the big problem, all that money they control isn't just those individuals, it is money from pension funds, it is money from massive amounts of families....

What could potentially happen here?  This could be completely out of the normal and be both amazing and beyond horrible.

If you think this is limited to GME and a few other equities and the shocks are limited there you have no idea.
This.
Why do they need to take such drastic measures if Melvin Capital and Co. said they covered their short positions? Weren't they trying to brag about that 2 days ago? LOL the hypocrisy in what they say and do. Now I feel more certain they lied about closing most/all of their short positions.
George Soros is tied to all these Hedge Fund asshats. Ken Griffin, Steve Cohen, Andrew Left, Mike Bloomberg. They all decided that we are too stupid. 

Here is the king daddy of Resource Investor who has the former SEC Director on his board telling all of us he did it for our benefit.

That did happen to him; that’s why he conspired to make the frogs gay.
Saw that on Twitter today about imagine just halting trading in 2008 on bad days while the big guys ""figured things out""
I honestly believe they're going to raise regulations on day traders and retail traders. There will be some type of license or subscription fees you need to pay to participate in a larger scale. They will mitigate the chances of this happening again.
At his scale, I wouldn't be surprised if something like that hasn't happened to Soros at some point.  Retail traders almost never get exposed to it, but counterparty risk and failure to deliver is a real thing. Doesn't happen often but failure to deliver can happen, and the clearing house is on the hook to make good.

The clearing house was willing to let retail accounts sell, because there was practically an absolute certainty that the retail account actually had the shares and would deliver them to the buyer, as brokers tightly control what retail can do (no naked shorting, strict margin enforcement, for example). 

On the other hand, if a retail account tried to buy stock, the seller might have been offering something they didn't actually have to deliver (even if the seller in good faith thought they had the shsres, the party that they bought them from might fail to deliver and so on up the chain).  Sellers could be hedge funds, market makers, etc who operate under much different (and in a lot of cases more lax) rules than retail.  Higher margin limits, uncovered shorting, etc.  Given it takes 1-3 days for a transaction to actually clear, and GME was the highest share volume traded stock over the past couple of of days, there could have been (and possibly were) massive cascades of delivery failure, most of which the clearing houses are on the hook to make good. 

Delivery failure ocurs when there's a transaction that takes place, but during the clearing process, it turns out that one party can't meet their obligation (the buyer can't produce the agreed upon cash or the seller can't produce the agreed upon shares, for example). 

Clearing houses evaluated the risk and made the call to suspend retail buys to mitigate their exposure. That's part of their business model and how they make money, they guarantee the normally trivial risk that counterparties won't  deliver to close the deal. If that happens, they step in to either produce the cash or shares to close the deal, then go after the failed party later to recoup. 

Mitigating the delivery risk the way they did it solves an immediate problem, but it is going to expose them to an entirely different set of risks from regulatory enforcement (I suspect they actually didn't do anything wrong, given their fiduciary obligations), and political.

I'm not an apologist for the financial industry, just a retail investor who took a wild ride today.
We aren’t happy, make our voices heard.
Oh are we doing some dumb QANON shit in this thread?
Or like with what Icahn did to akman.  Difference with this story is Carl had more friends in the administration's at the time.

We appreciate you guys 💎🤚🏼🚀
you are not George Soros
They do this all the time. It's called circuit breakers. Look it up.
This is fake news you guys are so stupid thinking this is some crusade and everyone is out to get you. It’s such a simple view of the world and it’s really like Qanon. Please stop pushing this fake narrative, people are doing an a old fashioned stock pump, it’s manipulation, the brokers platforms broke down because of the demand from the pump and dump, don’t worry you degenerates will get a chance to buy again
Is not even normal today! You can only buy whole stocks, no fractions and there are obscenely low holding limits so you can't buy more if you're above that imaginary line! RH has restricted $GME to FIVE (5) shares

I can't wait until some right wingers lose money on GME and blame this whole situation on Soros.
You know what this NOK GME AMC did, it gave the little People hope.  And people just need a little bit of hope, what happens when you give hundreds of millions of people a little ray of hope it becomes an unstoppable force.  In time these stock will come back to normalcy but people won’t forget the week or weeks they smashed Goliath

Not to burst this bubble but we've all been through this dance before. Let's stay outraged and keep being loud about it, but... don't pile all your hopes on there. Hedge fund bailout is likely inbound.
Meh, we will be squawking about race or gender in a week's time exactly like they want us to, exactly like they have wanted us to like before.
Today was really crazy, and a great insult for all online investors. Fortunately there were many, even with greater visibility than us, who pointed out the problem. I hope that in the next days it will not reappear.   
Anyway if they wanted to scare us, it didn't work at all: with this trick they have created more buyers than sellers of gme.
A few questions on this 

1. Can you explain a bit more how this would have spread to the rest of the market? (I ask this because these hedge funds and massive institutions on both sides of this trade, because let's face it, there are whales on both sides, have hundreds of billions in cash available, or if push came to shove, some of those positions that have gone up 10X in the last 12 months, close some of those out to raise the cash therefore giving companies who are not short, the opportunity to buy those shares. GME isn't going to a trillion dollars Market Cap)
2. Can't Gamestop themselves issue or dilute and therefore drive the price down while raising capital?
3. Can't the firm(s) who are deep in shorts, decide to close up shop and declare bankruptcy?
4. Couldn't they repeat today's action to continue to depress the price in a slow methodical manner, while closing out their shorts?

Thanks for taking the time to type all that.
Can you explain some words in this more in detail please, I am very unfamiliar. “a small sell limit order executed at $2600” what exactly does that mean?

**\*\*\*SAVE SOME AMMO FOR THE END, IMO\*\*\***  

On Thursday, they manipulated the price under the magical $200 level in the final 30 seconds (as a test run for Friday?)  Remember: if the price moves too much within 5 minutes, there is a *mandatory 5 minute halt*.  Strategy, troops.  It's a financial battle they know they can not afford to lose.  Let's outsmart 'em.  Make sure you log into your accounts extra early in case the login pages magically go down again.

TL;DR   🚀  at the end
If GME goes to the moon I will get a large poster of this printed framed and hung on my wall
From a layman perspective (me) it looks very suspicious that rh is enacting on a policy change that resulted massive benefit to a client that its getting 40% of revenue from (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25946480) which is a clear conflict of interest

But at the same time Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM&feature=youtu.be is claiming that the clearing house (DTC) is increasing the fund requirement to prevent market crash like 2008

I am trying to find if that claim is true, can someone that is more knowledgeable than me provide some insight? (preferably with source)

Thanks
Maybe they shouldn’t of shorted the stock 130% and try to bankrupt GameStop.  I said this once and I’ll say it again. Fuck them!  Fuck them today. Fuck them for 2008!
so with what happened today what do you think will happen tomorrow? rh is already saying they'll allowed limited trades of gme.
So if GME goes to infinity the market collapses? Will this wipe out just hedge funds or will all other stocks plummet too? This doesn't sound very positive.
dude this comment is insane! sharing this everywhere
Sounds like those  sophisticated investors, ivy league graduates, market makers, titian's of industry, Gordon Gekko wanna be's need to revisit their series 7 exam notes and spend about 30 seconds re-reading the part where is says  ""unlimited loss"" when selling shorts.
> DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

I mean, he's not wrong.

Edit: You are being a bit dramatic. This isn't threatening to bring down the entire system. It's much larger than a few meme stocks, even if funds are highly leveraged in their shorts against them.
It reached 470 today, triggering some calls ITM that will Spike up the price AH. It's the first time in days it ended lower than previous close. This might run out of fuel to climb higher tomorrow. There are too many unknowns to gather a picture of where things stand with the hedges. They shorted more while blocking people from buying, creating massive sell off and could continue tomorrow. DFV is still in it, how high can it go?
I have a question why do we want to crash the market. Even if the rich get fucked over for their corruption doesn't that hurt us like how the 08 market crash was one of the things that caused the recession.
Thank goodness there are circuit breakers to contain the spread of an infinity blowout on the CME.
THANK you for this explanation!!!
here is proof from the user that saw that ridiculous sell price

Come on! This is armed robbery, you're going to turn it into a murder because you don't know how to use that fucking gun. This is like taking a swing at your dad when you're 16.
You're only talking about GME.

NOK for instance they completely crashed it and the HF's modified their positions so today it's DED.  


The GME story is a scapegoat while they stole from MANY SECURITIES on the same day.

The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. You know, unless you rig the market.
until they bankrupt Melvin, when there are no longer any assets to cover shares and the entire GME scheme implodes because they have worthless contracts. do people think they have infinite $$? the harder they press the hedge the closer it pushes them to bankruptcy and they all loose and create a new set of rich pricks. On top of which they are going to bone the rest of the market when Melvin is forced to push all there assets back on the open market to pay for these share, ultimately still screwing over retail investors.
Tulip mania.

Every stock is a different coloured tulip.

And everyone wants tulips.
This may help explain why around 11:30EST ask was $214 but bid was $5000 on TD....
Dude you need to post this on wsb
If it isn't getting traction dm it to some famous user
This absolutely needs to reach everyone.
This was an incredible write up thanks for it and I totally agree, there is a huge level of scarcity right now, thankfully people are communicating it, but there are many that seem to just be buying for the sake of buying, at insanely high valuations, the emotions going to get very real for many, the biggest thing to hope for is if the internet is enough to give voice to convince people to continue holding, which seems to thankfully be swaying that way right now, we can hopefully all ride it holding hands together.
I don’t know if holding is actually the right call here.

At some point there’s a chance that this ends up like a old time bank run. Where everyone goes to collect their money only to find it’s all gone.

What do you do then? Every shareholder, some of which may have had their shares shorted from underneath them, will have paid a lot of money, astronomical amounts in some cases, but the shorts and their backers simply can’t pay and are bankrupt. That’s not including the options that are about to expire tomorrow.
WTF does any of this mean?

Whatever I'll just hold..
Agree with all of this except: Prison time was never on the table for them, never is on the table for them. The concept of ""illegal"" literally does not exist for the elite and they know it.
I want to read this later.
I know you want your short squeeze but Thomas Peterffy summed it up well. The initial shit that got this rolling was foolish by Melvin, but right now it is simply manipulation and dangerous to both brokers and customers.
so when do we sell?
INFINITY SQUEEZE!!!!

How do the shares of this stock possibly impact the greater market. That seems far fetched. Generally curious and don’t know the answer.

Lol, in the next scene of Snowpiercer, don't they all get mowed down by security in the next carriage, and they have bullets?
How can WSB be driving this?  No way they hold enough stock to influence the market this much, right?  Isn't this other billionaire funds fucking with each other?
Thank you for this.
Awesome scene in snowpiercer!
If the market crashes, don’t we end up back in a 2008 scenario? Financial system loses liquidity, credit crunch, bank failures, business failure, redundancies etc.?
Crashing the entire market is not a good thing - many people have worked and diligently saved/put money into their retirement funds and 401ks. If that's what stopping trading prevented, I hope they stop it again.

I’ve already bailed them out before, let me bankrupt them and then maybe keep them dead this time?
Media like that is controlled by billionaires
This is the stupidest argument by far. Where is the protection for people getting mortgages they cant afford, student loans theyll be butt fucked for life to pay back, 30% credit card interest, predatory car loans etc
Write your Congress members and senators! Working people should not continue to pay for the follies of billionaires who exploit them.
The media is owned by billionaires... So it's in line with their interests to misinform about the situation. MGS2 but instead of the AIs, it's r8ch people controlling information
Which is exactly why it will fail. And exactly why nothing will change after this. The general public has no fucking clue what's happening with GME etc. right now, and they'll likely never be the wiser. A month from now, we'll be paying these hedge funds back with taxpayer dollars. Hell, they'll likely get their bailout with the next stimulus omnibus... the irony will be incredible.
That surprises you about the media?
Yeah, why arent brokers protecting americans from the financial industry's pillaging?

Why? Doing it this way seems to work better.
This post should be higher up.
That's simple - who the hell funded the company in the first place? That's exactly who made them put in a few safety measures in.
That's quite a common feature tbh. Noticed it happening alot with certain Canadian stocks I was trying to buy these last few months. Seems that the last hour of the day is when it happen most.
Sorry mate this is actually normal.  They're still fuckers, but this is a reasonable feature I think, like if a stock is delisted
As a software developer, I would backup your built-in-advance theory, however, I would contest the backroom discussion part. I imagine that the SEC, and possibly other regulatory organizations, requires all trading software to be able to stop sells/buys in case something crazy happened where they needed to halt stock exchange business.

Or for software reasons... they build it in if something gets hacked or if their software ends up with an unforeseen bug.
Don't they already do that for stocks transitioning? Splits/reverse splits, buyouts and the like.
[deleted]
I think they weighed the possible SEC retribution and the loss of a chunk of their user base (maybe a quarter?) against the pressure from the big shorters to act NOW and they ended up siding with the billionaires. And who knows what form that pressure took, but you can bet losing enormous sums of money creates some incredible pressure. They use their power to never lose.
Robinhood blocked GME, AMC, EXPR, etc for the same reason they block penny stocks. The people who invest in them probably aren't well informed and they are likely to lose money.
What country are you in? I'm just curious, as my Swedish broker (avanza) put a 15% cap on pre market prices on both buy/sell. They put it on all American stocks though, and removed it after a while. 

I have no idea why this happened. Could be completely correct and something applied to stop extreme volatility. But since I've never seen it happen before, and it happened exactly when the Americans got locked out, I wonder if people over the world faced similar weird stuff.
Which broker?
My European broker IBKR also blocked buy orders but Robinhood's getting way more attention
What broker do u use im also in europe
Moving to Fidelity from Robinhood myself.
I do and that was some bs.  I’m done with them.  Been with them since the tk days
Is fidelity the best platform? Did they restrict anything, I don’t own GME but it seems I’m in a rather hurry to switch from robinhood now as they think it’s ok to restrict certain parts of the market because they are “volatile”
Yup. I’m with you. Moving my shares as soon as the dust settles. I have a fidelity account as well and it is great. Been at ally since it was zecco. My first broker, but fuck this

I was watching it the whole day, it hit 492 in the morning but never again, might be a glitch
It was, the moment we saw numbers over $500 they announced they wouldn’t allow sales and cut the legs out from under it.
So it might be a glitch but there are instances where you will see this happen.  There are times where there is a transaction that doesn't clear correctly so it doesnt show up on the tape.  Usually they clear these at the transaction price after hours so it doesnt have an impact.  So this one hit right on close, so that explanation kinda makes sense.  But I dont have it on my feed either so I am not sure.
[deleted]
I'm not seeing that on TOS either.
It hit 490 at 2 or so for seconds. I believe there was very low volume and someone was trying to sell at 490 at the time.
I saw that jump too and was curious about it, sincerely wonder if someone were to set a sell limit order if it would've activated, especially since sell was essentially the only thing most of us could've done today, aside from hold, preaching that most of us held of course.
It went down quick and mist places uses an avarage. It did go up to 490
It was500 premarket
That’s exactly when they put out the fuse on the nuke

There is talk that NOK was being pumped as a distraction to draw funds off of GME
BB was getting buzz on Reddit late last week because they sold patents and made the move into autonomy software. It was and is a good buy under $20 in my opinion.  

That just happened hundreds of thousands flooded WSB. They saw “buy BB” and assumed it was the next GME.
They were at the right place at the right time
NOK is a diversion tactic by the shorts to relieve the pressure on the GME squeeze
I like BB stock. They gooooood.
He's not even a good CEO. A good CEO will bullshit you while being consistent with his answers. 

That guy first said something like the clearinghouse required a higher volume of whatnot than they had, then next said they didn't have any liquidity problem, and followed it up by saying they had to prohibit (ONLY) the sell orders of 13 stocks... huh? If you didn't have a liquidity problem why did you need to throttle stocks?
Yes, I hate the fact that my European broker first blocked the buy trades of GME for most of the day and then, after all the hate it was receiving re-allowed us to buy when the market was closed.

But I am gonna buy anyway as soon as the market open, when RH will open again GME is gonna skyrocket
Damn that's tragic man.
The problem was that your aunt took advice from a dummy who knows nothing about the stock market. It would be like your aunt taking car repair advice from the burger flipper at McDonald's. 

I have no idea why anyone acts on ""investing advice"" from the uninformed.
Can you explain how that math works?  In 2005 PG stock was in the mid 50/share range.

In late 2008 (the year you cited when ""she had 30 grand in shares"") PG was in the low 60.

The absolute low point was in March 2009 (not in 2008) at ~45/share, and it quickly bounced back to the 50s.  

At no point would any of that price movement turn a million dollars into 30k.

It’s not the stock market that’s the problem, it’s the hedge funds who supposedly paid the brokerages to halt trading. Those are not interchangeable terms.
I use Fidelity and I was able to buy/sell with no restrictions
Fidelity, from what I've heard. That's where I'll be moving to after all this crap plays out. Robin Hood is done after today.
I haven’t had trouble with Schwab but apparently others did.
Also have Schwab, mobile app was acting flaky but the webpage let me buy without issue
Fidelity. Bought more today at the dip
Ameritrade still let you trade stocks.
No trouble with TD at all today. They just put on a 100% margin requirement if you’re using margin, but share buy/sell and straight call/puts action working just fine.
I was able to place limit buys all day on etrade. In fact right when shit started tanking I scooped up some GME
Not fidelity. Doesn’t sell their user data to market makers and funds. For now at least
I have set one stock to sell at 100k just in case ha ha

Do you, own your own business that they, the rich, constantly find ways to outsource and thus literally fuck your profit margin or do you, for example, choose to work at Walmart and blame them for not paying you more? Because there's a difference.
What does defi mean?
Then there should be some sort of settlement and structured unwinding of these positions.  Freeze the market, pick a number (higher than the all-time high by some multiple), and start liquidating things in an orderly way, ensuring the shareholders get paid.

If it's that bad, then somebody should also be facing jail time.  Any time the market is so broken that it cannot be trusted to fix itself, that's a screw-up that the powerful elite need to pay for.

Oh, and I want to add this: not only did hedge funds escape today, they made BILLIONS.  They didn't pay a cent.  They were undoubtedly shorting this at the very top.
I get the impression that hedge funds have still not been able to clear their positions because so many people are stubbornly holding. Brokers can't unilaterally block purchasing forever, and as soon as it's back I don't understand why things won't pick up where they left off. The losers today are the investors who could not afford to hold their positions, or who were too scared to hold their positions. But AMC, despite all of this, is still 300% of the pre-squeeze price and GME is 10x the pre-squeeze price... seems like shortsellers are still fucked.If anyone has seen DD on short interest after market close on 1/28, can you please link it in a reply?

> we sold all your shares

There are rumors that exactly that happened. Robinhood forcibly sold many people's shares, and some claim that those shares weren't bought with margin.
You can see the current ask/bid on E*TRADE if you go to the page where you make a trade (at least before 8pm EST you can). But you’re right, E*TRADE restricted buying early this afternoon and hasn’t said anything about allowing unrestricted trade again.
Could it actually crash the entire market though? The entire market is worth trillions
The market could crash, but Tesla and Coca-cola are still the same company as before.
>  We need to realize there may be a larger consequence to this than rich people losing money, it could crash the entire market

This is what I have been saying. All this makes me very anxious as our economy is all tied up like spaghetti. Few hedge funds falling could become a Domino. 

Unfortunately, the people they beleive they are helping could be the same people that will hurt from deeply a crash.   


I am not feeling positive about all this.
Did you buy on margin?
I’m using Robin Hood as well, I transferred 1k into them before all these shenanigans happened and after one 20$ payment was rejected it now says I have a account deficit of a thousand after the money has already been taken from my account and I can’t get a hold of any representative, I’m worried about what’s going to happen to 1k of my earnings after I eventually sell my stock
You need more up votes for this explanation.
Do not understimate this as something about America (I know that the majority of this happened there), broker all over the world did the same thing. It's not about Wall Street vs RobinHood users, it's about hedge funds and billionaires vs the 99.9%

I would just use a diff broker cuz fuck RH
These hedge funds control the media. That's the narrative they want but corruption is *actually* the true story. They need to be punished. They took away our rights and intentionally manipulated the system and cost us our hard earned money and completely violated the idea of a free market.
You’re fine with being told when you can buy and sell or when options are afforded to you or who actually controls your money?

There are plenty of places to go to be a eternal bootlicker, we’re trying to make The West not one of them.

I mean, the fact you even ask this is kind of sad, but GameStop has been a member of the SP500 for over 10 years, so yeah. It does affect you.
I'm holding 5 CME and I'm too old to need to sell it.  I'll take with me to my grave before I give it up to cover Marvin's shorts and I'll be doing it in your honor.  Your family is lucky to have you.
I did the same, gradually sold on the way up so I still have a small profit but I’m out. The fuckery is running so deep in this trade I just don’t want to be involved.
That one was honestly rather easy to see since Europe tanked well ahead of NA and sensibly speaking, there was 0 chance that huge corps like Tesla, M$, Uber, etc would fall just based on 1 day stock dip. If that, literally one day, was orchestrated to facilitate some rich farts shorting or just dumping their shares to other rich farts since no one else could really afford it back then..... well, it still didn't really touch smart, long term investors.
Hedge fund greatly overextends themselves betting that GameStop (GME) will go down.
Deepfuckingvalue let's people know and people start buying stock. 
Stock price goes up
Hedge fund is basically on the hook for buying those stock at the inflated price until their bet is fulfilled (as I understand it, buying the same number of stocks they bet on going under the percentage, which was over 100% of the actual stocks available by GameStop.)
Because people are actively buying AND not selling, the hedge fund cannot buy the stocks at a beneficial price. 
Robinhood(app broker company, alongside apparently others) prevented ALL purchasing of GME and some other stocks, depressing the price so that the hedge fund could at least have some of a break, likely breaking the law and DEFINITELY fucking over their customers who used their service to purchase the stocks.
Basically, and always has been rigged, but I'm dead-positive that there shortings are NEVER really aimed at your average Joe who might consider buying like, 10 shares of a downhill burning company because it seems like such a great investment.
I think CNBC was saying that.
I understand your decision, as I said in a previous post this got political and many are holding for 'revenge' against Wall Street. I will HOLD and HOLD, but at this point I have no idea what can happen...it's not like we can just say: 'We want 1milion per share', at some point even the people who lended the shares will say: ok keep them and let's find a deal
Not anymore
This
Dude RH is limiting trades tomw on GME to 5, how is that helping after what they did today. It’s helping their backers, not their clients
>boomers or whatever insulting term you want to call us

That's literally just the name of the generation. If it feels like an insult, maybe that says something about your generation.
One of the biggest entertainment on WSB is the massive “loss porn” that’s frequently posted. 

They may joke about it but no one who spends more than a day in that sub believes stocks only go up.
[deleted]
Oh cmon man stop thinking everyone is a victim, maybe they liked the research and decided the risk was worth it.  The stock market is inherently risky on speculative plays but its not your business or mine to take that opportunity away from people.
You’re just mad because you lost three out of your four summer beach houses, if you ask me they deserve the fucking loss
I don't think you get it. Redditors aren't buying because they want big bucks or they really believe in GameStop (tbh, the store sucks). They're buying because they know they might be out a couple hundred dollars by the end of this. But the ""elites"" will be out billions ($70B currently). And a LOT of people would happily sacrifice $200 to stick it to the man.
No one believes only stocks go up. High horse much?
[deleted]
Oooo I like this
I don't see how this applies to cash accounts. Margin yes, in which case just disallow margin trading on volatile stocks. But if you buy stock with cash, there is no backing out or risk to the broker to hold your bag because you bought it with your money.
Just look for stocks that are shorted by a large amount.
Well, perhaps 401 isn't such a sweet deal to use as primary tank for retirement since it sits on volatile stocks.
You can try to buy back in when markets open, as RH is unlocking the stocks tomorrow. But quantities may be limited. Sorry to hear you got burned like that. I hope you came out ahead in real dollars, even though you got swindled out of serious potential gains. It's not your fault.
Your choice was not stupid, anything could happen at this point. After yesterday I wouldn’t be surprised if they delisted GME at this point it’s crazy.
They also closed stone accounts positions without their say so. This was a coordinated attack to protect the rich.
Agreed. What other stocks do you like? GME from an investing standpoint is tapped (though I’m still in favor of holding cuz fuck em).
They didn’t shut it down because of 401ks. They don’t give a fuck about regular peoples 401k plans, they care about their own bottom line.
short % went up today not down,  float wasn't enough for them to cover.  misinformation
If that happens, it will be a wonderful opportunity to buy!
If you really doubt me Then ask yourself this. Of the 300,000 worldwide people that have access to Bloomberg terminals, how did the people at WSB have access to them? How did WSB find out that GME was shorted to the hills? 

WSB is playing both sides against the middle and everyone in the middle thinks they're going to get rich and they're not.

The point here is that no one went to jail and no one lost their bonus in 2008 though many ordinary folks lost their life's savings. So I understand where you are coming from but basically I still say eg them. Consider this a long overdue punishment for 2008
This morning I had a CME market buy order paid for with cash on RH that they accepted and confirmed and put in the open market queue.   Two minutes into market open they sent me a message telling me that I had cancelled my order which is BS.  Liars lie what a surprise.
Can you link me said  articles I’m interested In hearing the other side
Well said.
Lol why would they go bankrupt from that?! The alleged issue was they didn't have the immedate capital to cover buys as required by regulations, it was never going to result in them being insolvent.
We down big over here
you talkin bout last march or the gme thing?
When someone makes errors like this I can't take whatever they are saying seriously at all.

Particularly when someone writes ""loose"" instead of ""lose"".  I see that a lot on reddit, and it always sort of depresses me.

So shorting a stock 140% isn't a coordinated attack to crush the value of said stock and profit?  Sounds like they screwed up big-time and now they are begging big daddy to bail them out.

Yes, but that would’ve been on their own trade/accord...today they were cut out as OP said. Today was scary.
Large part of the shorts expire tomorrow eod you know so there are still chances for the squeeze to happen
Go lick their 20k boots then.
It is, it showed that if your ""stock of choice"" is all of a sudden doing well ""we"" will make it so you can't buy any more of it and manipulate it into poverty and at most all ""we"" will get is a smack on the hand for it while ""we"" ruin your holdings and life.

There is no free market, the free market is controlled and a joke now. Corruption is everywhere and your 401k's are only allowed because some rich people said so.
It's hypocrisy.
I lost $10,000 today others lost over $100,000 to million today yeah it was serious and they should go to jail.
I mean yea its market manipulation by the top 1 percent
Lol
Yeet the rich!
want to bet?
I am thinking long term, if in 5 years they will talk about this when they talk about this period in books you will own me your wife.

Now tell me what you want if you win, but consider that i am pretty broke and that my future wife will have at least two boyfriends
Yes. It’s literally market manipulation by the top 1 percent. It’s all over the news. I don’t see how it wouldn’t
These morons are definitely a lot richer than your ass.
Barred from investing? Sounds pretty unconstitutional. 

You don’t like their decisions of what they do with THEIR money so they are dumb and you’re a genius. Got it.
It's already up 3,500%... no thanks. CCL is the stock to target.
Reddit is so fucked.
Freezing trades and allowing hedge funds to ladder trade the price down via minimal volume protects the users. OK.
Oh yes, a broker that only allows you to sell during a panic sell, and prevents you from buying the bottom!  What an AMAZING trade!  You must be a buy high sell low kinda guy!  Their favorite!
Yes. Absolutely, in theory.
The common number I've always heard thrown out is a million dollars assuming an 8% annual return in something like an index fund would give you $80k a year to live off of. Some years the market would be shit and you may only get 3% (30k) and others it may be booming and you'll get 11% (110%). You'd probably need more when you consider things like healthcare, if you have children, etc.
Chamath mentioned CashApp, Public, and Sofi as alternatives.
WeBull also blocked out GME today - am culling them as well after GME moons.
Eh, it's actually the other way around. By banning purchases, they've cut back demand. As demand falls, so does the stock price. It's really terrible because everyone can sell but fewer can buy, so you get this great deluge of selling action to drive the price down. 

But I think your general point stands. It's not like Robinhood is the only broker. People will move funds and find a way to purchase GME again. Could just take a few days.

My concern is that they say they'll allow ""limited purchasing"". Like, wtf does that mean? It sounds to me like they'll allow the price to move up but not enough that it'll actually hurt the shorts any further. It's totally illegal and complete bullshit.
And most of their fuckery is also amongst themselves. The working class, let's use a great example of a good few disgruntled GS ex-employees who have been uprooting all the malpractices going on in the burning-down company - do you honestly think THEY were the ones who gladly bought those shorts? Who were the imaginary numbers of stock were sold to? Who was actually losing money on this one?
Sadly it isn't just a RH thing, I use an European broker (eToro) and they fukd up as well
Fidelity never closed trading. I don't think Schwab closed trading either.
[deleted]
I am putting another 1.5k in GME as soon as the market open, my prevision is that this got out of hand and RH and other brokers will reabilitate users to buy soon.

That's when we will fly to the moon.
They want us to sell though right? How do they benefit from restricting GME sales?
Keep it, I have BB also and gonna buy even more. BB Will go to the moon🚀🚀
Yup. Election wasn’t real. Stocks don’t help businesses. Rich vs the normies.
few days ago I would have said to buy and hold shares (no CFD or options) but at this point I am also afraid that they are going to find a way to save the hedge funds anyway, so I am not sure...

I will still buy some more today at market open, but those are money that I am ready to lose in that case, btw I am not a financial consultant, blablabla, I just like this stock
I liquidated BB to get even more in GME, but you are right, wish you the best tendies
On the flip side, that means you couldn’t sell while you were down either tho lol
You meant hodl, I guess.
Please do that.

That’s because it’s not capitalism. The only time in history that we’ve seen free-market capitalism was the first 150 or so years of America. You know, when America went from being a barren wilderness to the greatest superpower on earth—and its’ free citizens gave the world electricity, the power of flight, and a myriad of other brilliant advances. 

Now we’re yoked under the burden of a government Mafia bleeding us dry and blaming the extinct notion of capitalism for the harm they’re doing.
Nokia
What we seen here today is a great example of how these guys get to do whatever they want to make a buck. These hedge funds and their brokers would have went bankrupt today if it wasn’t for buying being halted.
I had something similar happen to me: my mortgage escrow went up $20 while I was out of the country and I didn't notice, so my auto payment was $20 short each month. My auto payment was being *received* by PNC, and they were depositing it while issuing me a refund check for the *full amount*. After 4 months of this they put my house in preforeclosure and when I returned in month 5 I only had 2 weeks left or I would've lost my house to foreclosure from underpaying them a total of $80.

From my view of my bank account, it looked to me all along that I was paid up and my brother in law who was checking my mail never told me I had scores of notices from PNC, but it's still crazy that they can make this happen over such a small amount. Cost many thousands of dollars to get it out of preforeclosure.
[deleted]
The problem was their losses were in the billions, and the legal penalties for what they did will likely be measured in the hundred thousands or millions.
Well... considering how many contracts have fine print saying that paying a loan off early means you get penalized, it's not that far fetched.  Everything about the financial system sucks.  I stay as far away from anything to do with it as I have to, other than the 13% my company has to put in my 401k, and my health insurance portfolios.

I truly have become the ""money under the mattress"" type as I get older.  Don't have any faith in any aspect of the markets, or financial contracts, or anything.  Been straight up lied to and then ""lol should have been a finance lawyer and read all 250 pages of that loan agreement in excruciating detail"" when I pointed out the terms weren't what they said, months later.

Everything is a scam.  It's legal robbery.  Capitalism's a joke.

Edit: I am -somewhat- pleased to see there's at least an actual backlash going on, but having seen enough financial debacles and how not a single one has ever resulted in meaningful change, not holding my breath.
This is a really good analogy of what's happening! Thanks for that! Another question, maybe bigger than just this singular event, is how many times has this happened in the past? Has this short a stock and then manipulate the market to force the stock to sink been done before? When it comes to making or loosing billions, you can be guaranteed they have been doing this for a long time!
They stopped it because what happened with GME is market manipulation.

The fines and even prison sentences they could get are a fraction of the punishment that losing tens of billions of dollars will be.

They don't care anymore, and are increasingly desperate.
This needs some legislation, this isn’t very cash money/laissez fair of these brokers...
Actually.... yes.  They can.  If you sign a loan to payback a loan 1 year out at 30% and you want to pay it off early, they do not have to take it, if they want their 30% return.
These people have homes in the US. I say we go ahead and just start occupying their houses.
Did we just time travel back to March again?...
RobinHood has been doing this crap forever.
Fucking rigged game. I'm one those people who lost as OP described.
Look at what’s happening today. No one is selling at these prices.
This is the hedge funds manipulating the price.
I would really like to believe this is true, but I’m sure there’s something somewhere that says they are allowed to. All these users probably agreed to it when they accepted the terms of use.
I want to have have the confidence that people will be held accountable, but I doubt it. Cohen has been fined $1.8b before for illegal activity. They’ll get some fine, pay it, and be back to their same ole’ shenanigans is how it’ll probably go. Expect next time, they’ll make sure the average American has absolutely no chance of beating them.
Yeah, I wouldn’t say I’m spewing hate speech or propaganda by any means. Propaganda is biased and meant to mislead...these are facts. They are manipulating the market, it is undeniable. Whether or not they are found guilty is another topic. It is just very concerning. This has been going on for a long time, but not at this level.
Yeah. I would defend the argument that they will never be bailed out again. The American people are not going to allow it to happen in the future.
They arguably destroyed market confidence as well. They are having to use all the tricks in the book to try to minimize loses. Just look at what they’ve done all week and today.

Narrator: It wasn't.
The 🚀  launched bud. That how so many ppl got rich. All the people buying at 380.. they are literally pissing their money away. You missed the moon launch and now there's a buncha dumb 🐒 holdin the bag thinkin another ones coming. 
BUT. I think once wall st covers their shorts. (And they will btw, thats what all the manipulation and cheating is for) the stock should shoot up again just on sheer volume of ppl buyin and holding. A handful of ppl will bail as soon as they break even. But this cult of 💎 ✋ will miss that boat too. 
There are alot of ppl losing their life savings on this. And they are too dumb to get out. I predict an uptick of suicides in the next few weeks. 
Im just a retard. This isn't financial advise. Full disclosure:I still hold 4 shares.
Someome on WSB mentioned they could only issue a maximum of 1 million new shares (something with a contract of the new board person). Anyways, 1 m shares is NOTHING. They need 15mil  TODAY. They are super giga fucked and doubled down on it, using scare tactics, short ladders and even shutting down trade platforms. 

Price is showing 340 aftermarket :) it didnt work and they know it. Payday is coming. These crooks should be in jail already.
Why would they
Had GameStop reacted in any way yet? Not sure how prudent that'd be on their part.
Wondering why they didn't protected funds from shorting more than 100% of a stock.
Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/4RS4JIEVyXM) of webull exec explaining why they had to stop allowing trades. Essentially the clearing houses told them they had to stop because of huge liquidity issues
Total fucking bullshit. I am an option seller and volatility is how I make money. Today I am literally staring at GME option chains and their juicy premiums but sitting there and can’t do jackshit
Wondering why they dont protect my dumbass with 0 investing experience when i buy a NIO option that drops by hundreds in an instant. Where was my protection then?
 we did this to protect ... 

our friends from losing money
exactly! where was the 'protection from volatility' back in March when lockdowns were announced...
I couldn’t believe it when I seen the word protect. It’s been about my only holding that’s been green since Friday. If I want to buy GameStop at 4, 40, or 400, that’s my problem. 

But go ahead, you can buy doge at .07 cents currently a 500% increase today alone, 1500% on the month as well, and it could go back to .0025 in an hour and nobody would be the slightest surprised and it certainly won’t be stopped, it’s moved half a penny in the time of writing that. Go buy tons of crap penny stocks, or nikola.
Fuck that. They don’t need to “protect” our money, or in other words, dictate how we spend our money. If this were true why only impose limits on specific securities and not all? 💎🤲🏽 THEY DONT GET TO MAKE DECISIONS ON OUR MONEY 🚀
Hi guys. I am seeing a lot of information flying around accusing brokerages of blocking retail traders from buying with the express intent of screwing retail investors. Here's another, more rational take, coming from an associate of mine who works on Wall Street:

* In the US, there is one central securities depository called the Depository Trust Company (DTC).
* When you buy a stock on Robinhood, they take the order to DTC. DTC fills the order by finding a seller. The same thing happens when a hedge fund wants to buy securities, or a bank.
* However, there is risk associated with matching a buyer to a seller. To mitigate this risk, there is something called the ""settlement cycle""
* The settlement cycle is a 2-day holding period where the buyer (in this case, your broker) puts down a clearing fund deposit to collateralize the transaction. After the two days, they get the deposit back.

So what's happening here?

The clearing fund deposit that buyers have to submit is adjusted based on market volatility. Because of the volatility surrounding $GME, $AMC, and these other stocks, the clearinghouses/DTC are requiring firms to front excessively high collateral in order to buy shares of these companies.

Many of these brokers like Robinhood simply just may not have the cash on to front the collateral to fulfill the massive influx of buy orders incoming for these stocks. So they suspended accepting buy orders for the stocks. They kept the option of selling open, because they have a fiduciary duty towards their customers. Their actions are a byproduct of not having enough money to fulfill the orders.

Why can hedge funds and big banks buy then? Because they have plenty of cash lying around! And if they don't, they can borrow it from each other. Because of this, they don't have to worry about being locked out of the markets due to volatility.

In summary: please don't jump to conclusions and assume bad faith before it is proven. There are lots of people here and on /r/wallstreetbets who have been ""investors"" for less than 2 weeks and don't understand how everything works. Let's keep a cool head and not make accusations which we can't prove. That goes for everyone, including those in the media. Thanks.
To protect us, bull. Not a single person that had bought GameStop had lost money, or was going to lose money (unless they chose not to sell). EVERYONE that bought in at any price was up until they pulled their stunt. The only people they are protecting is themselves.
I'm trading with a small percentage of my portfolio on gamestop. Why protect me when Im Already doing that

There's so much irony here. Their attempt to protect us ended up hurting us. Look at Deepfuckingvalue. Are you trying to fucking protect him by making him lose fucking 14 million? Fuck you robinhood fuck you greedy wall street fucks
Robinhood didn't step in as you lost your retirement and livelihood last March. They'll let you wipe your whole account with options. But if you dare to buy GME then they'll ""protect"" you from volatility?
I’ve gotten my ass handed to me on stocks that were shorted and manipulated into oblivion by the MM. I feel no sympathy. Where’s the broker when I’m losing my tendies then?
Yeah I should ask them why they were cool with me blowing $140,000 on a single options trade but when I’m suddenly getting filthy rich they have to “protect” me.

What fucking joker pieces of shit. Fuck those guys and I pray to whatever fucking god is out there that all of them rot in jail.
I don't know how all of them handled it, but Robinhood stopped buyers. Anyone that has already bought GME could still sell and keep their profits.

They were protecting users from buying the stock right before it got dumped.
“It’s for your own good,” is a really popular statement among abusers....
Wait - did you get a 1k bonus too? My account got one for about an hour and then they took it away.
They let people buy bankrupt companies and now they are concerned.
If anything they increased volatility letting short ladder attacks to beat down the stock while retail could not provide buying pressure.  What a joke today was.
Or like over shorting a stock doesn’t fucking increase volatility
The brokerage is not our fucking dad. They provide a service, end of. That shouldn't be allowed to change on a whim.... ESPECIALLY when the stakes are so high
On Robinhood they had an outage during the COVID madness in late February. The outage cost me 8500 and almost cost me a full 16000. A nice portion of money I used to trade. They said I couldn’t prove I was going to sell it and offered me a 50$ gift card for their mistake. (They forgot to program the leap year)
Right?? And you can get throw your entire portfolio into an option expiring tomorrow if you wanted to but they’re “protecting us?” I just hope this isn’t resolved by paying a measly fine. I’d like to see prison time
Wonder why they let me waste money on options if they're so concerned
Rh closing users positions on their own is the craziest part.
The recent reduction in short interest is rather revealing and damning. 13% reduction in short interest shares. I expect it to be much higher tomorrow morning prior to open when all trading resumes apparently. 
Tomorrow it’ll be “Hey everyone, it’s all fine and well. Come on back and give your money to us since we’ve closed our positions! It’s okay little guy, we forgive you and were not going to bite you...but try that again and we’ll just have to see” 

https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=GME&submit=Short+Quote™
Maybe we now have an argument to be able to sue them whenever we incur any loss.
Now they’ll say “look, the stock dropped, so we were right to protect you from it”. But it’s like a self-fulfilling prophecy. The only reason it dropped was because they decided to “protect” people.
You already have to sign off on a bunch of agreements to invest saying you know that the stock market is risky can lose a lot of money blah blah blah, and they have no problem letting you invest in trash stocks most of the time.
Exactly! They never cared when the “dumb money” pissed away a few hundred dollars here or there (and paying through the nose for the privilege), but suddenly they’re the guardians of the simpletons...? This stinks to high heaven and beyond
Yeah did you protect me when I was losing money? Or are you only trying to protect me from gains now?
where was IBKR when I lost close to 100K shorting in March-April... Why didnt they stop me! in buying PUTS! lol
Exactly, when I was hemorrhaging out my ass a few back because Twitter banned Trump, nobody turned the system off to save me from volatility. 

Assholes.
It's also in the TOS that if you lose everything, they're not liable. They said they  were only trying to protect the buyers and the firm. Vlad is a lying pos.
It’s a donation.

""protecting you from volatility"" Jesus Christ that's the biggest bullshit I've ever heard.
During AOC's livestream today, she had a guest say something that really stuck with me. He said (and I'm paraphrasing), ""So I can get denied buying stock in the name of 'being protected from volatility', but I can walk into a casino and bet all my money on red without repercussions?""
What about 3x levered oil or gold? I can do a market buy right now on 3x oil etf and no one is going to save me.

That pisses me off immeasurably. They are not at all considering my own risk profile. Why does retail have to be restricted so often? Like from making day trades?
I listened a bit on the AOC stream when she was talking to Alexis Ohanian and they mentioned to good point, brokers were protecting us for volatility but we can go use those same funds and put it all on red 19 at the roulette table. It's our money, as retarded adults we should be free to gauge our own risk.
They didn't care much about protecting retail investors when they are the victims.

The difference between this and 08 is ordinary people didn't get a say in what happened when the economy tanked in 08. Now we do get a say. If people want to risk blowing their savings to send a giant ""fuck you"" to wall street then that is their right to do so.
They robbed me of money actually
Freetrade app said they were blocked by US firms. Trading 212 lets you buy now both GME and GS2C (european GameStop stock), just dipped in £100 on GME, had £300 in FT but that was blocked
I keep reminding people, but brokers are actually fully within their rights to cancel a trade to protect the user from volatility *if the trade is being made on margin*, like a short sell. It's *very common* for brokers to pre-emptively call in short sell options if the seller is too far under water.

They didn't do that. They took the unprecedented step of preventing the numerous buyers from buying, to protect the very few hedge fund managers whose careers were on the line over this. It's textbook manipulation.
They'll stop you from buying stock to ""protect you"", but if you wanna go tits deep in selling naked calls they shut the fuck up. Its wild
The “we did this to protect you” line is such bullshit. They wanted to protect potential buyers from volatility and losses, so the forced volatility and losses on previous buyers??? Fuck that. I hope there are real prison sentences for the way this happened so blatantly and so proudly.
It’s so obvious too - GameStop closed Tuesday at 146, closed Wednesday at 345, dipped to 264 on open on Thursday at 9:30 am before exploding to 469 at 10 am. Guess when the shit show with restrictions started lol. Tell me the hedge funds weren’t shitting themselves when they saw that and immediately shut it down.
I used Soros because he is famous by his risky trades.

I dunno any other trader that would fit lol
Same. I was like, ""oh no where is this going?""

This is what happens when you are a brokerage and don’t charge for trades.  The broker becomes the market maker and it is they who take the risk for trades.  CNBC today reported that Robinhood had to tap all their emergency lines of credit today to avoid bankruptcy.  Who do you think loses?  It was Lehman in 2009 that was the market for mortgage backed bonds that initiated the waterfall of losses that caused the banking collapse in 2008.  Tomorrow and over the weekend everything will have to settle from the options expiration.  Then we will see who wins and who loses, and what the blowback will be.
I wouldn’t doubt that. I’m just saying for the first time since Occupy Wall Street people are standing up to these major hedge funds. This is our first chance in a long time to make some real change
Just been watching this from the sidelines.

RH fucking everyone over today does not sit well. I'm buying gme shares on vanguard at open and deleting RH.
Question, how do we know it didn’t work? Could a large percentage of people sold and those stocks be bought up by the fund?
yea, this didn't help them at all.
not trying to scare you dude - trying to stay in business
I agree, this dip has created a better buy in point for traders and we’re unstoppable now, GME to $4206.9
1. It had already spread to the rest of the market the past few days.  Notice how red the market was as GME was surging and how green it was as they were falling?  These funds with theoretically uncapped losses have to liquidate other stuff to stay solvent and keep enough cash in their accounts.

2. They could, that's always a risk, but things are so volatile right now that I don't even know what that share offering would look like.

3. Not before liquidating everything and using it to cover positions.  Then, whoever was backstopping them on these terrible deals assumes the liability.  This is why firms typically get margin-called BEFORE it gets this ugly, but they weren't.  They were bailed out by their buddies.

4. Also yes, but how will they sell shares they don't have?  They run out of ammo at some point.  If the price goes up higher, they could find themselves underwater no matter where their current short positions are.
1. The entire market is aware of GameStop. Its on the news 24/7. Its trending on Twitter and Reddit. Google Trends predicts interest will continue to grow via search results.

2. The share offering is capped at 100 M. That's less shares @ $300 than @ $15. We just need to hold those shares. They can only offer once every 3 months. The stock price and time is on our side.

3. No, because Citadel is their backstop. Citadel is worth 38 B. They can pay up. Melvin Capital will get sued.

4. They can try to take away the buy button again on robinhood, but millions of people are aware now and have shifted funds/ prepared to use Fidelity or Vanguard or TD Ameritrade.

5. You're welcome. Join the battle and hold the line.

Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀 and fuck CNBC.
You know that ""Bid"" and ""Ask"" thing you see?  Bidders are those who are willing to buy and askers are those willing to sell.  They each have a price.

If the minimum ask price is 2600 and all the shares are being gobbled up, it might reach up and very briefly touch some weird number.  It doesn't necessarily get reflected in the live price you see on Yahoo or Google; those sites are aggregating all these orders from different sources.  Your brokerage may be a little different than the next guy's.

Typically, a huge bid/ask spread is reflective of massive volatility (or really low volume).
TD Ameritrade did indeed have a buy price of $5,000 and if hovered there pretty much the entire time GME was selling for under $200.
I saw that 5000 ask, too when trading was halted.  Bid was 196.  I think that just means the spread was huge, not that the order went through.  Maybe due to illiquidity or just an artifact of the halt?
Can second this, I saw muiltple thousand dollar price points during the day. I was one of them at 1k before i retracted my order. 

I assumed the market was just halted again since the bid was like 200 and the sell was 1k-2.6k
So, if I want to buy some shares tomorrow, when would the best time be in your opinion?

Not asking for financial advice.
Can you explain what happens “at the end?” Do they have to pay whatever price it ends on tomorrow to exit their positions, whether they want to or not?
[deleted]
You have 5 grammar mistakes in your first sentence but think you're qualified to comment on the stock market?
That short started in Sept 2007, imo. Agree on the rest
GME and AMC have both popped up for me tonight and I've been able to put in orders. From the looks of it they're only going to allow people to buy whole shares. That is going to block out a lot of people
I’m wondering what that means too.
I really don't think there is enough at stake to wipe out the market here.  But, for certain players, they stood to lose tens of billions.
Nah, there's not enough money at stake for that. We are talking about a couple of hedge funs losing a few billion and maybe declaring bankruptcy or getting a bailout.

I think the US stock market is worth something like 50trillion by market cap, drop in the bucket.
It's very positive if your entire portfolio is GME.
i'm not a stocks guy, but i've seen a few videos explaining parts of this.  the ending explanation is a big grandiose.

when you short a stock, these are the literal steps:

- you borrow the stock now and sell it for $20
- you buy it later for $5
- you keep the profit of $15

if the time between borrow, sell, and buy is quick then it doesn't matter.  but if it takes a long time between and buy, the actual end of it, you have to pay an interest payment on it.  like you would any loan thing.

BUUUUUUT, what if you try to do a short and this happens

- borrow the stock and sell it at $20
- wait and............stock goes to $500?!??!?!? fuck what?
- ok so do i sell it now or try to wait more and see if it goes down to 5 like i thought it would?

so if you sell NOW, you lock in that you lose $480 per share.  OR, you keep the share AND you have to pay interest on this ""loaned"" out share that you got in the first place.

so all these hedge funds that shorted the GME stock, and have not sold the share yet, still have the loan, and are getting charged an interest on this loaned share.

so reddit users just sitting here owning this piece of stock, doing nothing the fuck else, is costing wall street tons of fucking money.  so as we saw this single bad overreach that brought down this one hedgefund already, it could have lasting affects on other funds too.  that's the big ripple effect he's talking about.
No, because eventually Gamestop will issue more shares and dilute the float.
I mean... this is like someone smashed all 4 of your windows, and you put trash bags on each one so you could drive around. What you own is a ""car"" in name only. And it deserves to be tossed to the curb.
Nobody knows how high it could go, and that's why they literally shut it down.  They got spooked by the prospect of zero liquidity in the market and all these obligations coming due (shorts covering, calls executing, etc).
Yay meme amounts... A ton of people had their limit sells at $420.69
For change so this never happens again. This is now more than making money, its a full on movement against hedge funds shorting more stock than exists and banks letting funds get away with it. 

I feel like they would have a better shot at halting the stock and paying everyone $1,000 a share. It will cost tens of billions but compared to losses in the ENTIRE market it will be a drop in the bucket.
Shorts are betting on a company's demise. They accelerate things like Toys 'r Us going under, costing jobs, and all the additional fallout from that. A lot of the ""bad stuff"" that Wall Street causes is a result of their practices, and so even if the market were to crash, it could still be beneficial to the average joe in the long run.

(I'm not smart and don't understand all the details about the causation of such things, this is just what I've contextually learn from other people asking the same questions. I could also be just plain wrong in my understanding, so take with a grain of salt.)
Yeah I really don't feel like losing my retirement savings because the entire market crashed. Few side bucks would be nice though.
Good question. I'd like to know that also.
We’re already in a recession, the market just doesn’t reflect that.
Absolutely.  If we get this thing over $400 tomorrow, it's blast off again.
And it is the reckless, manipulative, arrogant hedge funds who should pay the price (literally, financially) for causing that danger.

I'm perfectly comfortable with a, say, $100B settlement distributed out to all shareholders.
I’d say 1-2,000. I think they will halt trading on it indefinitely if it goes beyond that
You're good.  It's a small part of the plot and happens early.  Watch it anyway.
Nice.  Thanks!
Sure. But it's the same story of them bailing out people who should be pushed out of the industry and perhaps put in jail.
You will get it back and more if you hold. I say it goes at least to a 1000.
Did you hold like everyone said?  Check aftermarket prices.  Not that aftermarket matters much but play it out.
If you couldn’t lose it, you frankly shouldn’t have invested it.
It can prevent this from happening in the future

Make sure the 10k wasn’t lost in vain. Hit the brokerages where it hurts
You only lose if you sell.
The hands you had: 📄


The hands you needed: 💎
You played the game and lost... no one will do anything for you, just like no one should have done anything for the hedge funds. That’s literally how the free market works.
Did u expect to earn money from this? The people involved are ready to loose EVERYTHING they put in. Its the whole point. Some people will never sell because are actually trying to stop this.
was down $100k

bought more at 121
Yeah mine was jumping back and forth between 180 and 255 at one point for like 5 minutes. Never seen that before
[deleted]
The options just may have been rolled forward causing the same effect on price.  I never heard the options market was stopped from trading, only the NYSE.
That's good though.

They sold at 120-140 and now the price is $400. 

More squeeze.
This is why people need to go to jail.  They weighed the cost of SEC fines and customers to peoples livelihoods.  The only real punishment that will start making them think twice is sending them to jail when they do things like this.
Not like they have to worry about jail time.  Column A is how much they will make after tanking the stocks.  Column B is how much business they will lose + possible SEC fines.  Column A is probably a lot larger than B so fuck everyone else.
A couple million fine from the SEC is nothing compared to billions in losses
Gun to one temple (retail) bazooka to the other (shorters) they could avoid one.
I don't think professional traders were Robinhoods targeted customer base, were they? I would assume a large chunk of their users do lose money, but I guess it wasn't a problem until today
Ok but why American Airlines and Blackberry?
If they want to protect themselves legally from reckless investors, all they had to do was put up a warning like many other brokerages. 

Blocking the ability to buy shares and only allowing selling shares, especially when you own a position is extremely manipulative. 

I don’t own any GME nor do I use RH, but this is kind of power and manipulation should not be allowed in any brokerages. It’s well known that shares in stock markets can go up and down and can even go to $0. Put up warnings and educate investors about volatility and that’s all you need.
The hedge funds who shorted GME lost a lot of money.  Does that mean that they were not well informed and should be blocked also?
Blocking buying but not selling? Forced everyone to sell lol. How kind of them to protect us
Nordnet
This is the way..
I use Fidelity exclusively and did not have any issues today. Keep in mind Fidelity and Vanguard have large positions in GME and were the two larger platforms that did not halt GME buying
From what the hive mind at wsb says fidelity did not put any kind of restrictions in place today.
Fidelity is #1, period. Rock solid, been with em 10+ years, no complaints other than their UI is 10 years behind the competition :)
I invest traditionally though fidelity. Didn’t check my portfolio once through 2020 and made 15% gains and never lost sleep. I fucked with options on Rh for fun and would be up 4K from where I started then down 2k swing dramatically before losing massive sleep and taking a break.

Defeated attitude is actually the enemy, not Change.org
change.org is meant to soften outrage about the rela issues. People go there, sign, and think their outrage has done something positive.

change.org is a pacifier for the masses.
For a change.org petition? The only thing change.org does is mislead people into thinking they have done something useful for a cause.  In my opinion it is actually damaging because people might actually do something useful if they didn't feel they had already ""done their part"" by signing a petition that will have no effect.

It hit 492 in pre hours trading and then a minute later Robinhood suspended buying and it crashed.
It was 420 euro(yes) in europe mine got sold at 410 so it was not a gltich I guess.
It was up there for a minute before halving
I saw it hit an even 500 for a moment, before a massive sell triggered.
He means a 500 bump at 2pm, not in the morning when everything shut down.
HOW IS THAT FUCKING LEGAL
thats not a conspiracy, that literally how theyre trying to stay alive
Well maybe you're out of touch gramps
It's the most educated generation in history
You must be thinking of the boomers.
If you can afford it you should, they all have good potential. AMC and GME the most. I think this starting week will be very crucial
as of this evening, it would appear it's 121%...

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=gme&ty=c&ta=1&p=d
There’s 65 million shares shorted, only 50 million outstanding (in the market)
They should be making an exception here as it's not brigading. Everyone, myself included, probably thought pretty highly of Robinhood until today.
Pity reddit doesn’t ...
What are people going to do? Not invest?

You think I trust the health care system? No. It’s broken and in desperate need of reform. And I’m still forced to play their game by their rules. Same goes for the stock market
Do you want to screw over arrogant hedge funds who think it's ok to cheat to get out of the big red dildo of defeat rather than take it like everyone else who makes a bad call?

If yes, buy GME. The higher that stock goes, the more money the shorts lose.
Pro: You could potentially make an obscene amount of money, or even just a few bucks.   
  
Con: You could lose only the dollars you put in.   
  
This is not an attempt to sway you one way or another, nor is it financial advice.  This is just how my brain breaks it down when I’m considering buying a stock.
Sorry buddy. I can't give any financial advice.
You'll learn more and have more fun if you buy a share of any stock.

There's a chance you lose it all if the company goes bankrupt though.

And there's a chance you can sell for gains in the future.

If you have a 401k you pretty much already own some stock more or less.
You would be able to go to the moon
Honestly, just don’t. 1 stock isn’t going to do anything for you.

But try and follow and read and learn as much as you can from this whole thing.
This isn’t about The returns, none of what’s going on is about financial advice or strategy to  monetarily benefit directly, this is all about giving Wall Street a taste of their medicine. they need cheap shares of GME and if we love the stock and buy them all up they can’t get cheap shares.
it is like if we all buy and hold, hedge funds would need to pay us very high prices in the future to cover their shorts and to cover the loss they would need to increase the price even higher. but if we sell it to hedge funds they will have lesser losses. it's all about the fight and our profit, stay strong!
The thought is there’s more shorted stock than shares even exist. When hedge funds short, they sell shares they borrow with the expectation that it will go down in price and they can buy it back for cheaper to cover their loan. If everyone buys shares and holds them, the price is driven up and the hedge funds must either buy them back at exorbitant cost (1000s% loss) or atrophy billions per day under the exorbitant fee they pay for the loaned shares (26%+). At the start of this week Melvin Capitol lost 3billion in a day or 30% of their entire value. In theory they can lose infinite amounts and traders will gain infinite amounts if they buy and hold. In practice as more and more inexperienced traders are drawn to this stock, they are more prone to panicking and selling when they see the wild price dips. Furthermore many people are hopping on under the temptation of getting rich quick rather than sticking it to hedge fund billionaires. Ultimately many hedge funds are facing massive financial and reputational damage (fuck en imo), and many small retail investors (us) are indeed gaining 1000% of what we put in, but many more will ultimately lose everything we put in and the wealthy have far more resources to fight this war, demonize WSB, and potentially litigate restrictions towards traders (citadel hedge provides 40% of Robinhood’s $$$ so Rh blocked buyers to protect them). At this point major institutional finance firms are playing both sides, so this could potentially be ongoing for some time. Hedge funds have released false news that they covered their positions to trick people into thinking the squeeze is over but the evidence was strongly to the contrary so people doubled down.

POWER TO THE PLAYERS🚀🚀🚀
I am no expert on the memes, but I think NOK started as a joke after GME BB and AMC as part of the 90s ticker resurgence.   Then it popped a little on some good news and it was off to the races.  I think it also helps that NOK was/is cheap and hadn’t had a crazy run up yet, everyone was looking for the next GME BB AMC and wanted in on the ground floor

TLDR. I don’t think NoK meme was nefarious
That's interesting if that's true.
The QNX system thats in the EV cars and spacex is what got me interested. The reddit hype definitely put me over the edge. I went from being up 200, to being down 196.
I think it was an organic joke that came from BB success (90s haha) and everyone was looking for affordable next big mover
You son of a bitch... I'm in
Literally the same way people blame the rich for their own lack of knowledge as to how to become so themselves.
Aunt was a dummy too. That’s why she worked the line at a manufacturing firm for 50 years. Still doesn’t give me sympathy for bigfinancial institutions to flash crash the whole market, trigger every stop loss and then recover the whole market by eod
But the fact that that is allowed to happen completely mitigates any form of a free stock market and thus the trust people have within it.
No it’s the whole market, the system itself not just the hedge funds.
The stock market was the entire issue in 2008. Rating agencies, hedge funds, banks, government. It showed that EVERYONE that makes up the market and the system are full of shit. How bad is your memory?
Bad take on multiple levels. There's no evidence they paid anything. Where are you getting that information from? 

Robinhood is backed by Citadel. It's kind of like you don't want to piss off your dad when you're a little kid.

And yes, the stock market is very much the problem. If you don't think so read Dark Pools.

Here's a copy of

Was I a good bot? | [info](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/) | [More Books](https://old.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/comments/i15x1d/full_list_of_books_and_commands/)
Okay.there was information floating around that they outright stopped trading gme. Guess ppl got it confused
That's good, but I had thought E-Trade limited buying gme.
I'm seeing so many murmurs around twitter etc blaming margin accounts, being able to trade before settlement etc, the stimulus (what a joke), greed, etc. Nobody would really complain about shutting off margin for small-time retail in the face of extreme volatility although they do get paid for it- but this is about the shorts. **He literally said it should be $17.** Why didn't the shorts cover earlier, they could have done so for far less $. Why did they short beyond reason. No risk apparently. It isn't even halfway bright.  
""I shorted irrationally because I felt like it.""  
""I didn't cover because I didn't want to, it would have cost money.""

Nice, I'm using those. Rationality is imposed on longs but a free for all for shorts.

It isn't even a market for them, it's a bank account.
How did hedge funds make billions today?
You want to unwind millions of transactions? Manually?   

🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤔🤪🤪🤪
My thinking is this isn’t an exact science, the other side is throwing everything they can think of at the wall to see what sticks.  Stopping trading and stopping people from buying shakes out enough investors to at least lessen the blow. And if there’s one thing the angry mob is, it’s ADD. They are desperately hoping enough people lose interest and wander away.
Ah, sure enough they are listing the real-time price there.
Apperantly it works if you use the website and not the app. I'll find out tomorrow morning
I did but had way more of my own funds transferred in than I was using margin so it's freaking me out.
Find a broker that allows in-kind transfers too! That way you can transfer securities instead of buying/selling and creating a taxable event.
I went to go look up reviews for other brokers' mobile apps so I could do just that but Schwab's was bombarded with 1 stars for restricting trades as well. So was TD's app. Reviewers were saying they did it after robinhood started restricting.
amen
Thank you. ✊
Exactly. I am under no illusions of the media being honest. I hate the media as a rule. I don't trust either side,  and your goddamn right they need to be punished. This shines a light on the inequality gap in this country for starters, but also on the different sets of rules that we play by vs the blue bloods. They need to be made into an example.
That’s so nice of you. I’m likely to buy back in tomorrow, obviously not in high of volume. 

I’ll do what I can to freeze some shares.
This is evil.

I don't recommend it tho if your trying to buy low and sell right away as the scheduled sales are iffy as fuck.
The only thing funnier than the loss porn is the fact that you will be held to your promises and the community will expect video proof and ban you if you don't follow through.
WSB has gained over 3 million people in the last week.

I'm pretty sure those people know nothibg
The shorts who put themselves in the position hold the bag - as it should be.
Then they fuck off out of business. I dont know much but I have easily learned that shorting stock can potentially lead to infinite losses. If it was easy for me to learn that then they knew that as well. So basically they were being greedy fucks shorting a stock into oblivion and lost how is that anybody issue other than theirs?
Dont worry. I am not crazy enough to bet houses on mania 😅
Hope you realize that the CEO will still make their money. Analysts are the ones that will get screwed by this, and they are the ones listening to their bosses. Many of them make less than Silicon Valley guys. 

Not sure where you got that everyone in a hedge fund is rich.
Why not get a bull
Fostering takes years to get approved, cost just as much if not more and since we are not married yet im pretty sure we would not get approved (Or maybe I am thinking of adoption), but that is the back up plan if this round does not work.  If SQ pulls a tesla and doubles, splits and doubles again in the next 100 days we will do both.
The issue is shorts can't keep their commitment to buy back shares because of the 140% short interest. The broker will liquidate their positions, but the broker is still on the hook for buying back these shares. 

So, if they continue to allow a short squeeze to occur by allowing people to place share and options positions (even with cash accounts), the share price would continue to increase, which they or clearing houses are on the hook for. This would go on until the brokers fold or the clearing houses fold unless they stop the increase in the share price. 

A continued short squeeze worsens the losses for retails as well, as people will be bag holding at a higher price when this eventually ends. 

The only realistic options now is to liquidate the shorts at a reasonable price.
Yes, but this activity over and over again would continue to drive the price up, which they don’t want obviously.
And you think much of that is going to remain after another day or so? Especially for broke folk who just spent their last $600 silly on 2 shares of GME that they'll possibly miss selling and end up taking a loss from?
they aren’t volatile stocks, robinhood affected much more than just meme stocks today
The market sell off fucked pretty much every fund, only survivor I have is BRK  B
5 shares

Homie isn’t going to get far. And that is a total limit, so if you already hold 5 shares you cannot buy more. It looks to most anyone like fragrant, blatant collusion to manipulate the market.
Any stock with more than 100% of the float shorted is a candidate.

Shorters are now being watched and system vulnerabilities are being exposed.  System vulnerabilities that hedge funds took advantage off are now publicly known and can be used against them.

I see this situation spawning Congressional Hearings for years to come.  There eventually will be system changes.  But the topic needs to be debated to death.

A word of advice to all, try not to be holding the bag when the music 🎶 stops!
>In the last generation most of the people thought about the stock market as something abstract and only reserved to the richest getting richer, only having a clue about what Wall Street is thanks to movies.

I know I was kinda gearing my comment towards this comment. I consider 401K to be retail money, but I could be mistaken.
short went up because its easy to borrow shares to short. IBKR lending rate not even that high. Old shorts gone, it's new shorts now. People shorting an obvious bubble.
Yes, I've seen all the 'we like this stock.  This is not financial advice,' bullshit that people are using to cover their ass so when they're accused of market manipulation they can say, 'Oh who, us?  We're just some idiots on Reddit who love gamestop.'

Here are two to start. There’s a third one that is really boring describing liquidity and how long stock trades take to actually settle in comparison to the immediate response we get on platforms like RH, but I can’t find it for some reason.
Here is a well articulated explanation from the Webull CEO of what goes on behind the scenes of trading a stock that caused brokers like them (and potentially something similar for Robinhood) to have to halt buying those specific stocks.

This is a great conversation. If you hear a term you don’t understand, pause the video and read up on it. 

Evil billionaires are mostly a meme and everyone should be more informed than the Reddit hive is allowing people to be.
Last March
No need to loose your shit about it ;)
so what is your exit strategy
:) 👍
There never was a free market. It’s always been this way. Hopefully this sparks some change...the cynic in me thinks no and things will only get worse for the average person. Hope I am wrong 🤷🏻‍♀️ rich people always tend to find a way since the beginning of time 😞
“Doing well” in the context of investing is typically defined as 15 or 20% gains in a year, not 300+% in a single day.  Do you complain about the free market if you’re not allowed to drive 300 MPH?
hope it was money you could afford to lose
You make it sound like this is over.. you do realize tomorrow / Monday, shit is going to hit the fan?

You really think the idiots buying meme stocks today, have amassed more wealth than I have over the corse of the last 15 years investing in emerging markets aimed at long term growth. Right. And your SURE of that? It’s almost funny to see you entitled teenagers pretend to know a single thing about legitimate investing.
Lol. Yeah arrest me for being ‘unconstitutional’. Dipshit.
I can’t trade GME on Cashapp.
5 total shares in GME and if you already have 5 you can’t buy more. It’s disgraceful
Hmmm I wonder what the fallout from this will be then. Its getting a lot of publicity so they definitely cant just ignore it
Wouldnt that be worse than 2008 then?
So you're thinking it's gonna spike up again?
Yeah that's very true. We have since been allowed to sell again but not buy. I'm not sure what benefit they would get from stopping us from selling, still pretty scary when it happened though.
So by some GameStop today and sell when? I genuinely am not not worried about the profit.
That’s funny? Trading is not just about buying. It’s selling and often when it’s necessary to prevent a loss. Apple tanked as institutions tried to cover their losses when the brokerage companies crashed. You ever hear about the Great Depression?!! Losing money is NOT funny. I own Apple in my Robinhood account and it’s down now much more because I was not able to get out of it before it tanked. The war between WSB and ROBINHOOD and Reddit did not just hurt WSB or hedge fund traders. Grow up
It’s got some problems right now for sure...
Ty
This just proves once and for all that the rich people truly are our fucking enemy.
And then any American whose retirement account was held in one of those brokerages would have been fucked like they were in 2008. Don’t you see taking down those companies doesn’t just hurt them, it hurts our parents and grandparents.
Absofuckinglutely!!!

These fucking hedgehog fucktards deserve to get bent da fuck over!
The rich have convinced us to be poor for over 20 thousand years when they created the first empires.
Never escrow the TAXES AND INSURANCE. Pay them both quarterly!  This will always save you in the long run. In 17 years of having a mortgage my home and windstorm insurance WERE NEVER EVER renewed on time!  So glad to be mortgage free. Hey CHASE FU!  Rant over.  I feel better. Thanks for listening.
In Austria we have a law that states ""Willingness to pay"" so if you pay any amount for a contract, you do not break it, even if it is to little. The reason is that you can say: ""Yeah you did provide some services but we need to talk"" and that cannot be held against you in court.

Is there something similar in your country?
Similar situation with Wells Fargo morgage. Three payments worth of money sitting in the mortgage account. They are refusing to apply it to the payment. Showing the account as delinquent
And this is exactly why when I bought my house I refused escrow. 
This just confirms it
Those are the sorts of things that appear in terms that you agree upon up front right?
Ya I think even artificially slowing trades would have the same effect, especially if multiple brokers are in on it.
No. Halting the trades was the manipulation that shouldn't have happened.
“When things I don’t like happen, it’s manipulation”
Hey would someone whose losses are capped at criminal penalties of a certain size be desperate?
I can’t tell you how many times on RH my limit buys were crossed and the price dipped lower than my limit buy by often $5 or so and went back up past it and the order never executed.

Their support tried to feed me some bullshit like “the price is the midpoint between the lowest bid and the highest”. Yeah, I KNOW so how in the hell could the mid point be BELOW my bid? 

They closed the ticket saying that’s our explanation, oh, and “limit buys aren’t guaranteed to execute”.  Uh, they are if the price dips to your bid, that’s how exchanges and order books work.
R.i.p.
I hate to be pessimistic, but if nothing happens I really think shit will turn violent soon. People across the globe are fed up with the lack of repercussions for Institutions, and they felt left behind and taken advantage of. 

After the capitol assault, I really don't see things staying the same, and remaining peaceful if nothing changes. People are reaching breaking points.

People are literally calling to eat the rich. It's the French revolution and let them eat cake all over. Income inequality historically has always either resulted in a police state with an authoritarian regime  or complete revolution.
If there was any doubt they were manipulating the market, there isn't any now. They're just playing and are willing to do whatever it gives them profit. Even if it means destroying people's lives. 

If holding means fucking over wallstreet, so we do it, but I'd hope President Biden and his friends to do something, just so foreigners don't keep the impression that their ""free market"" it's just free when they're winning.
😂😂😅. I’m doing better than yesterday and we still got some time to go.🤞Lol.
Thanks for clarifying, I really was clueless to what would happen in that given scenario
To raise capital.
Yeah their customer base isn't the billionaires so issuing new shares to help them would only piss off their customer base.
exactly. Some asshole on Bloomberg saying they had to stop trading to ""stop the losses"" - of course they don't mention that by stopping someones losses they also stopped someone elses GAINS. Like oh how convenient, you dont intervene when they're shorting over 100% of a stock but you will when regular people start buying the shares and holding them? This is such a blatant crime that it's ludicrous.

Edit - and of course they don’t actually specify WHO was suffering the losses. Imagine if he had said “we had to do this to stop the short selling hedge funds losses”. They wanted to make it seem like they were protecting losses from the retail investors.
They should have gotten called on it, they didn't want to play by the rules. Also, the supply (sell) and demand (buy) determination of price per share only goes one direction if you remove the demand. It's price-fixing. RH didn't halt trading, they halted buying. And in some cases illegally executed selling.
Fucking facts. Then they are bring up how hedge funds are using retirement accounts to over short this stock and it will hurt retail. Mfers. Dont look at us, look at the mfers gambling with retirement accounts.
Or better yet why didn’t they halt the stock completely this was market manipulation to drive the stock in one direction 👇
I assume that shorting limit and transparency will be the long term conclusion and regulation coming after the 28th Jan 21

At least the one we deserve
Because whatever the rich does is  A-OK.
FFFFFUCKING THIIIIISSSS!!! OMFG.
And no one talking about how shorting the stock to crush gamestop during a pandemic would have cost employees of gamestop to lose jobs, or wages. But fuck the little guy amirite bloomberg?
Exactly. The volatility didn’t come from us. It came from lack of risk management by the hedgies.
ok, but who accepted the shorts at 138%? Did they not think this could happen? These companies bare the risk because their business involves ACCEPTING risk. How is it our fault when they failed to analyze risk and properly prepare for consequences?

also, just because he explained how it worked, it doesn't mean it wasn't just intentionally steered that way to trigger that ""response"".
This is the most important video you will watch. You did it you glorious bastards, you broke wall st. Now you need to stay strong and get your pay day. This is complete validation that youve got the hedge funds by the balls.
This was a great listen.  This is also what the robinhood ceo interview on CNBC should have been.
I can understand that, but I think that they should cover the high point of stock (i.e $500), this is just billions we're talking about, not trillions.
Somewhat informational video, worth watching, but the Webull guy keeps referencing not being able to cover a sell, when many of us wanted to buy the dip but could not, as many of us had no intentions of selling.  If you can only sell the last day or so and not buy, that disputes his whole argument.  If at all, they should have stopped both selling and buying, to stop the panic selling that obviously happened anyways!
Good, then they should go out of business for their idiocy. If the entire system collapses then it was going to happen eventually anyways.
by liquidity you mean there simply weren't any more GME stocks to buy? so very few sellers?
I'm more curious why Benzinga, a supposed big name in trading news, have a boomer holding his phone up to his computer mic so people can hear his guest?
Do you think it is a fair takeaway from this interview that one of the final results of this whole situation may be the increased value of blockchain as a potential answer for the future?
Holy fuq
Indeed, most people interpreted it as them protecting us, but NO, they wwre protecting the whole system (which might still crash tomorrow,  or the day after, etc)
Huge liquidity issues = we don't want to pay fair market value for stocks we're trying to short sell. 

These assholes really just want a lower launchpad. That's it.
I wouldn't be so mad if they stopped everyone from trading it.  But the hedge funds and big investors kept going
So how is it that the liquidity issue was only a one way street? They had no problem processing selling the sales of GME shares (which were all bought by hedge funds). Again, no problem of liquidity for the hedge funds when they were buying thousands of shares for $150 after crashing the stock.

This excuse is BS. If you have liquidity issues, you stop selling and buying, and for everyone. Not just buying for retail investors.
TD Ameritrade locked me out from selling GME contracts yesterday. I tried to call - 3 hour wait time. Sent an email, and then tried their in-account messaging. No response whatsoever, even the next day. 

I still have three 2/5 40p I wrote a week ago, not selling those til they expire worthless. I could have easily made 10% of my account value yesterday. 

TD Ameritrade is festooned with assholes, BTW. In case anyone asks for your thoughts. Please, by all means, quote me.
As an options seller, can i ask if you know any other stock prices that have shown this kind of volatility in 3 days?
Where was my protection when I put 90% of my portfolio into options and then lost it all?
Not volatile enough!
What I don't understand is this is basically manipulating the market to stop Gamestop's share price from going up.

A struggling company is improving its financial health and investors are blocking it to make more money of their demise.

Doesn't GameStop and their legal team have something to say about that?
There were a fuckton of outages and stops. RH the worst offender
Didn’t robinhood shut down during that time too?
Get the DOG TO THE MOON
If reddit comes together to make doge go nuts I will be the happiest motherfucker of all time
[deleted]
So it's manipulation with a decent cover story.  The fiduciary duty can't be brought up to excuse allowing sales only.  I was on Robinhood this morning and had 25k in BB call contracts.  Where was their fiduciary responsibility to me when they allowed the underlying that I had long interest in only be sold, only allowing the stock to go one direction?  And why was BB even included in their sweeping blocks?  There isn't a short selling issue with BB.  No, they went too far and used the wrong tools.  You should not have the option of running out of clearing funds and the solution to that is only allow one way trading on stocks that you pick and choose.  Insanity.  Halt all trading on the stock if you cannot process the transactions.  And then you should be thoroughly investigated and need to change your risk management to be allowed to continue to be a broker.  

All of these crazy special rules and scenarios are all popping out of the woodwork today.  I've never heard of a hedge fund having to jump through any of these hoops or have any such restrictions put on them.  We wouldn't be here if they had.  It is their UNLIMITED losses that they exposed themselves to, and were allowed to expose themselves to, which has put us in the position that clearing houses might run out of money trying to pay off their mistakes.  And they are still allowed to trade?  How has Melvin Capital not been completely frozen from the market at this point.  If they have put one single penny back into GME in any shape, form, or fashion, they should all be arrested immediately.
Firstly, thank you for attempting to bring reason amidst chaos. What you explained is perfectly reasonable and very likely that the likes of Melvin were aware of this and as a result, have been stepping up their attacks to drive the price down.

That said, do you sincerely believe buy action will resume in 2 days time, since absolutely _none_ of the brokers communicated anything even remotely alike to what you wrote?

The rhetoric is ""This is for your own protection.""

So then what? I two days' time, they'll send emails to all their customers saying, congratulations, you no longer need protection?

Really curious to hear your thoughts, given your level-headedness.
Dude, the very definition of short squeeze is making the shorters going broke by having to honor the buyback/margin requirement

Do you see any big broken company here? I don't because they changed the rules to prevent it
Just because this makes perfect sense doesn't mean I'm not still salty about it happening. But ya I guess not having enough money in the brokerage to back these trades is a pretty big issue. I still need to redirect this unbridled anger somewhere though.
This is explained in the interview with the Webull CEO also. It is a little bit of comfort, what’s going to happen tomorrow though? Open up again now that there has been a breather?
Same. Was like “oh god please don’t drag us into this”
Other way around, mon ami.

The (racist) tin-foil loons hound the guy so much and use his name as a dog whistle, that as a Jew, I can't help but wonder ""why do they hate us today?"" when George Soros is even mentioned, let alone criticized.
Can't bang on about lunatic conspiracies without people looking at you like you're a lunatic. Coincidence?
Why does Robinhood need to tap credit lines?  All they have to do is not allow margin buying or shorting.

They choose to offer margin and then they want to use it as a BS cover to manipulate the market.

There's no SEC rule that forces RH or other brokerages to offer margin or allow their customers to borrow stock.
It will at least spread some *class consciousness✨*
**\*\*\*SAVE SOME AMMO FOR THE END, IMO\*\*\***  

On Thursday, they manipulated the price under the magical $200 level in the final 30 seconds (as a test run for Friday?)  Remember: if the price moves too much within 5 minutes, there is a *mandatory 5 minute halt*.  Strategy, troops.  It's a financial battle they know they can not afford to lose.  Let's outsmart 'em.  Make sure you log into your accounts extra early in case the login pages magically go down again.

**\*\*\*WATCH OUT AT 3:56 PM EST\*\*\***  

TL;DR   🚀  at the end
Go ahead. Any firm with that much GME exposure would likely do something similar. Part of being a broker is managing risk and protecting clients assets.
Don’t have enough free cash for gme so bought some amc. I wonder if everyone selling their positions on robinhood will drop the market
There was basically no volume. If people were selling, the volume would have been very high.
$1000 and then $5000, you probably wanted to say
What I don’t understand is if all this is so dangerous and close to wiping out the market, why is short interest on GME still so high even today?
>It had already spread to the rest of the market the past few days.  Notice how red the market was as GME was surging and how green it was as they were falling?  These funds with theoretically uncapped losses have to liquidate other stuff to stay solvent and keep enough cash in their accounts.

I think the correlation here isn't causaution. Early in trading on Wednesday stocks were up while GME was at 300. We only saw the sell-off (only 2% which is ./shrug) after the Fed released disappointing news.

There is certainly some profit-taking to cover but I don't think it is a -10%, -20% bomb waiting to hit the entire marketplace right now from this debacle/drama/awesome.
Thanks for your quick reply. 

On Point 4, I'm finding it hard to believe that WSB and other retail ~~degenerate gamblers~~ investors hold enough stock now to really block them and set a price. Don't institutions have enough stock to to sell to these shortsellers (albeit at a higher price) to get them out of this hole they've dug themselves in?
Holy shit #1 just clicked for me and that’s fucking wild. 

I’m just a boring vanguard investor and I would have seen a huge portfolio devaluation.

I kinda wanna see it happen, but I kinda don’t.
Why would Gamestop want to drive down their price?
I'm quite new to all this, trying to understand all this linguo when English is not even my first language. Your contributions are appreciated and have helped clear the situation. It's passionating. Now, I have a question that might speak of how noobish I am but, if all those investors are selling their long term held position because they shorted too much on GME, is it a good time to buy those other positions? We would hold more shares, and if they need money this bad, maybe they sell for less?
Again color me ignorant, are you saying someone executed a trade of GameStop stock at $2,600 a share today?
So, question. I was trying to buy on TD Ameritrade today when the buy was  ~$155 and the ask was $1500. When I went to submit, it was wanting me to *pay* $1500 - not the $155. BUT WHYYYYY.
> or really low volume

You mean liquidity?

I'm unaware of the effect low volume has on spread.
Can you still execute other orders with the stock if you have a minimum ask price? Or do you have to cancel your minimum ask before you do anything with that same ticker?
Someone could have accidentally sent an order for that 5000.  Might be how we saw the 2600
While it was halted a massive order could had come in on the offer and thrown off the COP making it appear the offer was much higher than it actually was. Most systems mask the book with the COP when stocks are halted
Oof...  I plan on buying some in the morning and playing the trading game if it keeps going up and down.  If it goes down, I'll just be holding then probably buying a few more right at the end (if they don't shut it down 1st)  

Brokerages may also restrict trading later in the day, so I'd lean towards buying *some* earlier, IMO.  Not financial advice; just strategy.
yeah Anthony sounds convincing, but these days convincing argument needs real scrutiny by the public, so I just want to know if this guy is not giving us bs, sounds like he is probably speaking half truth?
>You have 5 grammar mistakes in your first sentence but think you're qualified to comment on the stock market?


I never claim I am an expert, in fact I admitted I am a layman, thats why I was hoping people can provide some more insight since its always good to fact check 

Feel free to correct my english also, I am always trying to learn new things and correct my mistakes !!!
better than not being able to buy at all though
They all ready lost 10s of billions man.  
If this shit would hit like 10k$, they are looking at losses close to 1T$.  
It’s not about wiping the market, it’s about a domino effect of people not having the funds to actually pay up.
[deleted]
Man you are wrong, we aren’t looking at a couple billions. They already lost 10s of billions.  
A price in the 2-5k would mean 100s of billions of theoretically losses.  
Coming in 10-15k the losses would be close to 1T.  

They shorted that stupid stock at like 12$/share man
[deleted]
Would hedge funds going bankrupt affect ETFs or Mutuals?
Only the active shares are relevant when the war starts
Based on....
Not gonna happen, 250% float currently. Also adding stock volume will just increase the stock value further from their price point for their short positions.  Also GameStop prolly wants nothing to do with this firestorm. They them selves have a dog in this game why would they help the people trying to bankrupt them
The global community needs to just accept that WSB owns all the money in the world now and deal with it with a little grace.
This is exactly it. They legit didn’t have the money if this thing really rocketed high enough
After market level 2 shoes a bunch of people had more 420.69 sells haha
**That's not how any of this works.**

If the market crashes the big corporations will be bailed out. Then big corporations will buy the assets of those who didn't receive bailouts, and this will all start over.

Except they'll regulate the market to prevent this from happening again.

Retail traders will win/lose depending on where they bought in and when they sell. Retirements will be wiped out. Cascading effects felt in every sector. . .
whose fight is this tho? i don't get why trader joes would really care about such a technical issue as short floats etc. seriously! now, i can see professional traders caring greatly, but have trouble seeing how wsb seems to have inspired a bunch of literal amateur traders to go to war over a very technical issues that shouldn't affect their amateur buy/hold strategy anyway. buy/hold good companies fucking works. always has. its true what happened in 07-08 was criminal, but not really buying the 'it happened to my parents but no more!' narrative.
Shorts give people an incentive to unearth malfeasance. People will do a bunch of research and digging on a company and if they find out the fundamentals are worse than they appear or that they are straight up doing fraud, those people take out a bunch of short positions and then publish their research.

Shorters are basically the neo-liberal privatization of business regulation.
It’ll always bounce back unless we head for apocalypse. If you’re farther than 6 years out from retirement you’re fine and if you’re less than 3 years out from retirement and still mostly in stocks you’re financially illiterate and maybe don’t deserve retirement
You are right, I meant depression.
What is reckless? Shorting GME? Ughhh I think already  are paying the price for a bad trade. What danger?

I just don't get what you think should happen here. Not trying to be a dick, but they were not even close to imploding brother. 30 seconds? No.
I’ll cry about that later or never. We had a good option in 2016 and we chose an orange billionaire over a lifetime public servant that owns 3 houses. We don’t deserve justice as a society. But I deserve the 800% gains I made on gme today and the infinity squeeze I will ride from tomorrow into next week.
The amount of shits I took today was insane. I say this because the only time this happens to me is in extreme fucking stress and anxiety. Happened ONCE before. 

Didn’t sell tho fuck em 💎🙌
I had BB contracts expiring today.  What about me?  There's no holding for me.  I wasn't even a part of this GME stuff today.  Why did they lump BB in there too?  There's excessive short interest in BB right now.  But they fucked me good anyway.  What's my recourse?
[deleted]
I was watching this guy MeetKevin livestream, a bunch of news and stock updates on Bloomberg. At some point the stock tracker went nuts, it looked like it dropped really low and was going between red/green. 

No idea what happened, but you know there is some shady shit going on. They blocked our access, then initiated a bunch of tactics to drive the price lower. 

They all need to answer to congress and be restricted from trading.
[deleted]
Is that what this is?? https://twitter.com/rageagainstcake/status/1354909794461569024?s=21
We need to go Iceland on them ultimately. 

Jail them and restructure the system so they can never have that sort of power and influence again.
Its funny because what ur describing is literally what china did to jack ma months ago
Robinhood has a history of removing trading features that they deem too risky. This isn't anything new. The app appeals to entry level investors and they've probably saved a lot of uninformed investors from throwing away their life savings by limiting what they can and can't do.
American airlines and blackberry were being pumped in the same way. If they weren't actually being pumped then their value will return to what it was before buying was cut off.
The hedge funds that did naked short selling of GME should absolutely be prosecuted. But they knew exactly what they were doing. They weren't uninformed, unlike the mob of first time investors that were throwing their life savings on a stock that was up 20x in a week.
Do u have to pay for any stock? Like stock fee
>Generates publicity **and** nothing else
[deleted]
It could actually be hurting these causes. People sign these petitions and then think they have ""done their part,"" when they might have otherwise actually done something useful.
Defeated attitude? I have nothing for or against GME or any other stocks being traded this week. I have not been playing them because I'm not a FOMO sheep. I'm a shit trader, but at lease I'm not buying GME at 500
Already signed I mean someone should make a post with a list of all petitions related to this so we can advocate for transparency
[deleted]
I vote for charlie day. I missed this whole chance but Im intrigued how this person showed people how much power they have.
What?! There’s a face to the user? Holy shit. I thought it was someone who would forever remain anonymous.
I wonder if they have guts to do it again before the day ends on Friday with everyone watching. Perhaps they will do it after market closes at end of day.
there's no way in hell thats legal.
I see, got exposed for skim reading
If you measure it by high school completion and degrees, yes. If you measure it by what those things are actually worth (hint: not much), your couldn’t be further from the truth.

An eighth-grade education in 1940 > a high school diploma in 1980 > a degree in grievance studies now.
No: they’re selfish and entitled, not ignorant.
Interesting. Look at AMC. Float 107.7 and outstanding is 106.6, but float percent is like 41. How does that add up?
I just looked this up, I’m not sure you’re right. 

65 million shares outstanding are all shares.
50.65 million shares float are shares not “closely held” 

At least according to definitions of these terms 

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062315/what-difference-between-shares-outstanding-and-floating-stock.asp
I had just written a handful of blogs praising them. I loved RH until today. Webull abut to get so many new investors.
Yeah. Gave they a 5 star two years ago. Changed to one star today.
It was brigading though. There were threads telling people to go give them 1-star with some copy-pasted message.
Sure, I'm not saying they won't invest. We don't have much choice. I'm just saying they can't trust it. We all knew it was rigged but not to what extent. Now we've seen a glimpse behind the curtain.

Tbh at best, we **possibly** might get some tighter regulation on this sort of manipulation, but I highly doubt it'll change the game. Still, with people on their guard coupled with more information-sharing  (like what happened with this stock), MMs will hopefully have slightly less power.
Gotcha, thanks for the response.
People were looking for the next GME but also one that has some Fundamentals. NOK have won a bunch of 5G contracts and a NASA deal to put phone towers on the moon, so there is some basis for investing as well as being a meme-stock.
No, the problem is that billionaires are able to illegally manipulate the market without major repercussions.
Nope. They restricted naked calls and put the margin requirements at 100% but that’s it. Buy and sell just fine
They had eliminated market orders entirely. I had no problems buying with limit orders though
This is a great point.  Margin calls exist to limit risk, yet the very people who should have been margin called when the problem was manageable doubled-down again and again.  And they were backstopped by the SAME PEOPLE WHO CRASHED THE MARKET today.  Robinhood and Citadel go hand-in-hand.

How is this legal?  I don't know.  Everyone should ask his or her Senator or Congress-critter.
By shorting on the way up and selling on the way down.  Some are suggesting that they actively colluded to short at the top, then kneecap the retail trading apps.
No, I want this to play out naturally with 100+ billion in wealth transferred to the shareholders from the shorts.  That's my first preference.

However, if the argument is that what happened today was acceptable because ""Think of the markets!"", then fine, I would accept some sort of structured exit that sees everyone getting paid peak value.  That's a less worse outcome than allowing hedge funds to escape by using their clout to rig the game (and even profit from the rigging, as they surely did).
There is a $75 fee for transferring assets out of Robinhood. Honestly, I don't have that much, so I'll probably just liquidate.
[deleted]
I totally agree. Yes they are and I have no idea why they do that. Do you know? Perhaps it's just not built to be live? It is good for the slow and steady.
So you mean more accountability than Wallstreet.
[deleted]
Don’t care as long as wallsreet suffers
We only have about a 0.25 acres and you need more land than that for livestock.  But on a more serious note; I got my side chicks knocked up a couple of times so it's doubtful that after that and all the testing they have done on my swimmers  it has anything to do with me,   that's it's probably some issue with her eggs.    Other than that, my girl is pretty perfect so maybe she deservers a bull on the side.
Fostering you can get approved for in like 6 months max. It may take some time to get a placement, but ultimately it’ll be cheaper to adopt through foster if you wish. It’ll also not be much of a gamble/waste like with IVF, since foster system needs quality parents badly.
Bullshit. They should have froze all trading and forced short sellers to close positions if that's what they were worried about. Force a such and reasonably small squeeze, resume trading and watch it all fall down as they buy back market orders
Yeah, the *5 total shares* limit is a real kick in the privates to pretty much everyone interested in this entire situation.  RH put out a deceptive statement to cool people down so they would think, ""oh, they changed, it's OK now,"" but it was really another lie.
Yep some very normal people are going to get stuck holding the bag. I found a few I’d like to make a bet on (because make no mistake, it is gambling -and you should only bet what you can lose).

Can you recommend a platform? Obviously in and Robin Hood are out. (I’m American and in america so that should help). Thank you.
not enough volume to cover old position
Youre one of the first people ive seen to also see that what they are doing is markey manipulation in itself.  I also dont get their hypocrisy with eat the rich as they themselves are trying to become what they say they are destroying
Yes
Why didn't they just restrict all trading?
Thank you ill watch
That was, for a good most part, 1 day-1 week or so at most after which everything started to steadily bounce right back. That's definitely not a proper crash.
looks like they won't be able to afford them since you guys took 'em down.
You must have not dabbled in penny stocks. People constantly pump and dump these for over 1100% gains all the fucking time.
Lol hedge funds make that shit daily. You think they’re making 15-20% a year you’re naive as hell
So you're arbitrarily setting limits on how much profit an investor can make? This is a bullshit argument and a false equivalency.

You should delete this and feel ashamed for being an idiot.
So what percentage of daily gains do you feel people should be allowed earn?
I do if the speed limit is based on how nice your car is. Sure, the 40 I'm allowed to drive at is probably more sensible. But letting hedge fund managers drive at 300 while plebs have to stay at 40 is actually even *worse* than just letting everyone go at 300. And prentending there's no speed limit until you fine the poors for speeding is just bullshit.
It was but hoping to make some of that back since Robinhood is allowing those certain stocks to be traded again tomorrow
Oh I know this isn’t over, I expect everything to go parabolic tomorrow and back fire on them suits.
I'd bet you some GME stock but I'm not allowed to buy it
Why do you sound so salty? I wish I was still a teenager. Let them have their fun. I don’t understand the animosity towards them. I thought like you and missed out on the run. But I’m not bitter about it.
""They won't make in a day what I made in 15 years"" is an awkward argument. And barring people from investing isn't even an argument an at all
Insecure douche
First Happy cake day!

Second: it is impossible to make an exact exit strategy, if you want to see people that are making 6 figure per year working for Melvin Capital start looking for a job at McDonald or GME you can just hold until that happen (most of WSB, including me is doing this), another thing, a little bit smarter, is to keep an eye all day on the price and try to sell after the peak, but once again, we will not know when the peak is until things go back to normal.

Good luck
Of course they are! It's only called 'class warfare' when the lower classes do it but in truth the war is constantly being waged by the rich.
Yeet the rich.
Yup makes ape buy more shares!
The fact that I cannot up like this post makes me even more pissed!
Maybe the funds shouldn’t have played with those accounts like casino chips then, throwaway shill
And if you were actually confident about your opinion you wouldn’t be using a throwaway account, it’s almost like investing in stocks is risky. You want to fuck around and short a hedge fund, you don’t get to change the rules in your favour.
If your grandparents retirement fund was being YOLOd in GME stock, they were already being scammed for everything they’re worth. That’s why you invest your retirement primarily in stocks when you’re young and bonds when you’re older, because the stock market is risky. If this system allows your family’s financial future to fall apart over a fucking WSB meme, why in the smooth brain fuck would you be defending that system?
Can 401Ks invest into option trading? 

Also, what you're saying is that these companies are now beyond reproach. That because we are tethered to them with our retirement funds that they don't have to abide by the same financial standards we all must follow which is to never over leverage yourself or suffer the consequences?
Uhm yeah retirement funds can only invest up to a small percentage of their worth, so no.
Sorry that happened to both of you, that's ridiculous.  I have a mortgage escrow acct in the US for property taxes and home insurance. They have always been paid on time. And at the end of the year if there's a balance left over they send me a check (more than $50?).  If the estimation for the next year changes, they up the monthly payment amount accordingly - I also have auto-payment from a bank account setup.  So far, in over 10yrs, it's all worked flawlessly (knock on wood fingers crossed), even when the loan was bought/sold to different banks. I just re-setup the auto-payment the next month for the new bank. I highly suggest it.  I have friends who have this and they all love it too.   

But trust me, I do get where you're coming from, if the system doesn't work then don't use it. lol  And if your bank sucks, then don't trust them, agreed.   What's weird too is I swear the same bank company is OK in some areas of the country and not as good in other areas, I can't explain why.
Yep. SO TRUE. And most people, like I did making my first home purchase, will do whatever is put in front of them from the lender. Sadly mine was the perfect storm of timing, no one really checking my mail like I was counting on, and even the people renting my home not letting me know they were also getting notices (a navy guy who actually checked with navy ""legal"" who said not to talk to me at all during this... What?). Just a crazy situation. If I just had my notices on email alert I would've known. Live and learn.
I’m 27 and all of this is completely foreign to me. When do I grow up?
Wells Fargo almost caused us to lose our house. When they bought walkalloverya. They messed up the account. We were paying every month at the bank. They kept taking our money. When 2 guys posing as working for the insurance company was caught by me taking pictures of the house, I asked them what they were doing. They lied l, we called the cops and the truth came out, saying our house was in foreclosure. Luckily we paid by check and had all the evidence that we paid. They were posting to the wrong account. Then they tried to make us pay the interest on past due payment. Fuck wells fargo
Sounds worth looking into. I've been told recently by another lender that I should fight it being on my credit history, so I may look into it. Thanks for the thought!
Sorry friend. :/ Seriously screw these idiotic companies.
A little different but same premise- my dad got a medical bill from the same group my mom works for, he made payments every month on time usually $50-$100, $31.41 left & they sent him to collections because he didn’t call & set up payment arrangements. 🤦🏻‍♀️ smh they refuse to pull it back from collections-he refuses to deal with collections & keeps sending any money to them. Lol
That's not the point. The point is that it's bullshit for lenders to be able to FORCE someone into paying interest even if they can afford not to.
I hate to say it, because I’m attempting to have faith in America, but I am siding with you on this.
Peacefulness has gotten us no where, year after year. Look at 2008 and what came of it...twelve years later, and we’re in the same exact situation. People are starting to get violent. BLM, capitol raid, etc. People are getting more and more irritated
*I am not supporting this occurring, I am merely stating it may.
Yeah, it puts a sour taste in my mouth because other media outlets in other countries are reporting the story (from what I’ve seen) and it puts the United States of America in bad light.
Stupid narrator.
That “asshole on Bloomberg” was the chairman of interactive stockbrokers.

He’s not just an asshole, he’s a crook.

These are the gatekeepers folks. Remember that.
it's absolutely fucking criminal. I could certainly use the money but I'm buying in more GME in RH at premarket. (moving my portfolio asap too)

I'm so disillusioned and angry. I'll ride GME into the fifth pit of hell and fight Reagon mono e mono before I sell my gamestonks.
They directly caused me to lose money. I bought in at a higher price of around $350 to lend my support with a very reasonable stop loss at $140. Trading apps closed and the stock obviously tanked. Insanely low volume allowed institutions (market manipulators) to create a short ladder down below that and it sold off. This whole thing honestly just feels criminal. Prevent losses my ass.
STOP THE COUNT
Unmitigated losses is fine if the hedge fund can't pay, but is really bad if the brokerage can't pay. It's technically not their fault either - the SEC allows for shorting over 100%. What happens next if nobody can pay, a bunch of positions get liquidated and the whole stock market begins to crash.

Every brokerage today was trying to cover their own ass.

The real issue here is that the SEC put everyone in a bad position with allowing an unlimited downside risk to exist. You couple this in a hyper connected world and bad shit will happen.
Hmmmm and whose gain was it???? 🤔
“Massive hedge funds are making money, this is ok” 

“Normal people are making money, meaning massive hedge funds aren’t making money?? This is not ok”
Shit BBBY was only shorted like 65 or 70% and they still stopped the buying for that. I had both on Tuesday. I'm fucking furious for the people like me getting boned because they wanted to hold for more gains. ESPECIALLY after all the bs talk of US manipulating the market.
They said the last part out loud on the financial times podcast. We are not reckless. We stand strong together like a colony of motherfucking 🐜🐜🐜🐜 building a 🚀 bridge to Valhalla. Don’t fuck with us. Apes all in. Apes have 💎🤲🏼.
I am very free market and I normally cringe when people say eat the rich. But after this? EAT. THE.  FUCKING. RICH. This is the most blatant aggressive theft of market and free trade I have ever seen. I hope they all go to prison for the rest of their lives
How are hedge funds and clearinghouses not monopolies? Maybe there should be an antitrust case with nyse.
You can't even buy AMC stock right now. Try to. Whoever has any will make big gains.
Stop the losses? The stock was going up? So if the whole stock market comes crashing down 75% in a single day that would be a good thing?

President should brag look how low the stock market got today!
It's literally a zero sum game. Economists don't like to use that to describe an economy but the stock market absolutely is a zero sum game.
Bruh robinhood, webull, and td were suffering the losses. They have to pay for every transaction and the gme volume +volatility was simply too high. They had to get a cash infusion just to be able to offer shares tomorrow...
https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM
And you don’t stop losses by banning only the purchases of the stock like RH did - but what do I know, I don’t own a hedge fund.
https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM
FrEe MaRkEt

Everything this country is built on is a sham.
They end up in prison. 

There will be many class actions, some sharks will go even after their houses and secret funds.

No fucking way they will leave from this for cheap. 

Next step is create block-chain based market 2.0 where we trade and fuck them.
There're a lot of retail on the short side, it's how the squeeze is inevitable.  The vw situation was only 30%. At 140,  with retail piling on over 200 at one point.
Alot of you people on reddit need to either go back to law school or start reading the fine print, because there was nothing illegal about what they did and they will face 0 legal ramifications despite being unethical and immoral bastards that choose to side with their venture interests
They are gambling with someone else's money...they usually get paid handsomely anyway
Up until  now,  the scale of the risk has been absolutely hypothetical for them. An individual trader might fuck up and cop losses on a position or they have been taken down to a point by a competitor,  but they have not faced a concerted effort from large numbers of people from outside the game. It is fucking with their perception of reality. 

It would seem other parts of the world are taking enough interest to get on board. Apparently Europeans have getting into to this for a couple of days and now Asians are bringing war chests.

You Seppos seem like you are ready to  break shit and everyone wants in
I mean that’s like saying they saying it’s their fault they’re getting raped by the gang of serial rapists cuz they were dressed like a slut and didn’t hedge their position with a pimp.
Now it's time to make lists of the talking heads on cnn and msnbc who went out of their way to be snide and dismissive and figure out what they're short on.
Maybe, maybe not...? 

I'm not an expert or anything, but it looks like they stopped buys but they didn't stop sells so they were giving the hedge funds the opportunity to get out of their short positions.
It’s a required listening. Amazing overview how it all works. 

In the end you understand why things did get shut down.  There was no cash left to settle stocks.  At least my take on it.
Yeah, he keeps saying people can't sell, then proceeds to explain why the clearing firm can still take sells. A sell doesn't need a collateral, 'cause the clearing firm just gets the stock. There is no need for a collateral on something you have. So the clearing floor just needs to hold the stock. Well, okay then. So why does he keep saying clearing floors can't take sells and that the clearing house can't pay the sellers for them, yet retailer apps are still allowing sells?

Edit: And for that matter, how is it decided who the sold stock goes to once it has cleared? Whether it gets sold to someone who needs to payback a short or a new guy buying in?
From what l understood though the sell isn’t a problem because it doesn’t require the broker, such as Webull, to ‘put up’ the money for 2 days while the transaction takes place in this DTC clearinghouse, the buy does, and they don’t have the cash with the high volume. In my extremely amateur understanding of this, it should mean once they open it up again the pressure continues on the squeeze right? Thoughts?
No. There was a real risk of running out of money to cover all the sale transactions. This is a circumstance no one ever predicted.
You need cash to clear trades
Absolutely!
Switch to fidelity with me son. Fuck TD they can eat a dick. The interface is not as bad as I thought.
That sucks. I sold some $5 to $20P expiring Feb 5th yesterday before Interactive Brokers locked me out as well. Those contracts have an annualized return of more than 450% to 1000%. Insane premiums but we are not allowed to open any new positions. Free market my ass
I haven’t had any problems at Schwab. Totally free and great customer service.
It’s IMPOSSIBLE to reach them by phone which is how many of their transactions have to be completed (setting up regular MF purchases for example). If you want to stop or change a transaction good luck. They suck.
SEC has charged Robinhood; Congressman has demanded the Dept of Justice investigate the hedge funds and Robinhood; NY Attorney General is investigating Robinhood. Excrement is hitting the whirligig.
Did they shut down selling only?  Because that would be what happened here.  Could you imagine not allowing any hedges or other funds to sell during a market crash to protect the little guy, only buy is available while the market is in turmoil, we don't want these retail investors to go broke!  That's what they sound like except in reverse in this situation.  You don't halt one side of trading.  They don't have volatility halts that only allow the other side to trade so the stock goes the other way.  They just halt all trading and let everybody catch their breath.  Today was unprecedented.
ya I think that was from an ""outage"" per this [article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/robinhood-app-down-again-during-another-historic-trading-day.html)
I already feel like it was nuts. 

Got a screenshot of being up 2100%, my whole 35 cents of doge may just be the best return I get in my life.
I'm no math major, but I can see what the volume on GME is, and I can read 3-digit numbers and do some basic multiplication.  GME volume is in the hundreds of millions, and the stock is in the low hundreds.  So we are talking tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars going both ways throughout a trading day.  Even if all of that was in one direction, the market moves trillions of dollars back and forth every day.  I don't understand how this one stock can cause such an issue.  It's trumped up and this is their excuse for participating in coordinated and public market manipulation.
I don't know what will happen as I'm not sitting in the boardrooms. I think that clearinghouses will continue to demand high amounts of collateral until the price stabilizes. Brokers cannot use customer funds to pay this collateral so the money has to come from their own funds. As a result, while the collateral requirements are high, brokers will either i. decide they can't meet the collateral requirements and bar purchases and/or ii. brokerages will borrow money so that they can meet the collateral amounts demanded for the trades. For instance, Robinhood has just tapped its credit line.

In short, everything depends on how much the parties involved are willing to compromise. Given that politicians are starting to get involved and poke their heads in things, I think the clearinghouses, brokers, and banks will try to find a mutually agreeable solution to resume purchases as soon as possible to avoid negative pressure from Washington.
The CEO of RH said they had plenty of liquidity.
[removed]
No, what actually happened is that Robinhood couldn’t afford the deposits it has to give to the clearing houses that actually process everyone’s stock orders. This is a Dodd Frank regulation. Search NSCC stock clearance if you wanna learn more
How does the company make money?
Explain I’m stupid what happens in those last 5 minutes. I got to buy at 205 the last minute but didn’t get what what happening at all
Because backing out now is suicide so they might as well double down and pray for a hail Mary. Maybe the SEC shuts down trading, maybe every single WSB person spontaneously dies, maybe a meteor hits Japan.

They don't care about the market, they care about themselves.
In the current situation, they go bankrupt

If they make it worse, they still go bankrupt
> What I don’t understand is if all this is so dangerous and close to wiping out the market, why is short interest on GME still so high even today?

The market will be fine. The NYSE's size is something like $30 TRILLION, the nasdaq is $17 Trillion. 

Back in 2019, when the market lost 33%...something like $12-15 trillion of value disappeared...and it came back. A handful of fund managers losing Billions? It's a rounding error. 

>why is short interest on GME still so high even today?

As others have said...they are all in now. If they get out now, they're done. Their fund, their career, everything. At this point they have nothing to left to lose. Either they fold now and lose everything, or they stay in the game long enough to mess with the rules and maybe salvage this. The fact that they traded those stock down so efficiently, means they likely will do it again. Do it 2-3 more times, they may be able to unload their position, breakeven/make some money...then watch as all the diamond hands money evaporates when the stock eventually craters. 

I'm obviously not DFV, but he should seriously consider walking away at some point. $13 million is great, but $50-60 million is still private jet and house in the Hamptons money. Yeah, he might make $100-200 million if he holds, but wallstreet just showed how far they will sink to rig the game and prevent that.
Because it’s now the safest bet on wall st - the higher the price goes the biggest upside for the short. it will eventually crash.  We don’t know who has what shorts or when they will need to be covered. But if it’s new guys getting in to replace the old shorts, it becomes a war of attrition. Can the momentum from retail outlast the bleeding on short interest? Who knows.
Check Chamath's twitter, he has a 12 part breakdown of why the market was blood red. Tl;dr hedge funds sold out of their long positions in the broader market to rescue their short positions.

Everyone should read this. A large prime broker claimed this was the largest de-grossing he had ever seen. 

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Es2ABlnVoAQ3OTB?format=png&name=900x900
It’s just a matter of who owns what and how much they’re selling, if the guys who own a large amount of shares sell the demand and therefore price for those stocks drop as they flood the market.
If you think that its just retail that drives everything around GME then you are wrong. Do you really think other funds just sit there doing nothing letting retail earn $$? They're probably more into all this than anyone else, well maybe except DFV - he's the god.  


So to answer your question whether us, degenerate gamblers, hold enough stock, well I guess it is enough to keep price above 300 after hours!  


P.S. 100% agree on ""the hole they dig themselves""!
For a normal short, the broker will have shares on hand to complete the transaction.  But because the shorts of GME called for more shares then existed, it was impossible to quickly and easily satisfy the demand.
Doesn’t matter they’re 140% short. They have to buy the entire market then again 40ish%. At whatever we’re charging. Everyone’s stock will have to change hands several times before they can close everything out. Game stop spent the last year or so buying up their stock at rock bottom prices and cancelling it, reducing the supply. The shorters didn’t care because they thought like so many others that it was going to die so it was all going to be worth 0 anyways. And no one, of authority, stopped them.
Vanguard owns 7.43% of game stop shares right now, you'd be fine.
It was a very small amount.  A fractional share.  The total paid was $180-something, but at price per share of $2600.
[deleted]
Because the only seller available was asking $1500.
The answer to that is the type of order you submitted. If you submit a market order, then it looks to pair you with the lowest seller - being 1500 because no one was willing to sell at the time. If you place a limit order you set a price, say $155, and your broker will only fill it if they find you a seller at $155 or less.
No, the 2600 went trough
Dodd-Frank requires volatility scaled deposits  by brokerages for clearing. It's very likely that the massive volatility on heavily traded stocks like GME was pushing some brokers to insolvency.

Robinhood is going public soon. I would think that admitting they are poorly capitalized is harmful to that goal and is a good explanation for why they didn't come out and say this directly.
To be blunt...is English your first language, or are you young enough that you're still learning proper writing in school?
Why would they take losses that high when they can just declare bankruptcy?
I can take other stocks as payment if that helps...
Yup. I'm gonna pissed if I see that. 600 dollar stimulus checks is too much, but hedge funds that go balls deep into stupid ass positions with no pull outs get saved.
That's when we storm the Capitol.
I guess I’m confused, what stops them from just declaring bankruptcy? Their losses would be capped at the size of their fund.
Lol it's way more than that dude, apple alone is worth 2.3T (market cap)
Look at me.

I'm the hedge fund now.
I want to upvote but you're at 69
Oh no.

It'll be gone in days.
> Except they'll regulate the market to prevent this from happening again.

Kind of the point of the movement?
Seriously. It’s starting to feel like a bunch of people found a nuclear bomb and are excited to set it off to kill the rich who all have nice bunkers.  Blowing out a large load-bearing pillar of the stock market can’t end well.
And zero institutional fund managers will see the inside of a cell, that’s a certain.
What? People did due dillegence on this stock, look up Roaring Kitty on YouTube where is explaining in extreme detail on why this is a incredible buying opportunity and strategic trade, that was nearly a year ago. This is just the works for people recognizing the strategy and jumping on board. Yes - it has reached meme status but dont down play the fact that this was strategic on the part of many, many investors who called this a long time before then. Investment firms look for and take advantage of ideal situations all the time. Retail investors are not all stupid like people try and paint them as.
Shorting GME well above the float is absolutely reckless for this exact reason.  It is insane that we allow so much short-selling, let alone for the same share to be shorted more than once.

It is absurd that anyone should want to defend hedge funds and their predatory practices.  News flash: the only reason they can beat the market is because they can control the market, a privilege the rest of us don't have.
Name checks out
Please take care of yourself and mental health! I’ll see you on the moon 🙌💎🙌
So, uh... are you gonna tell us how many?
Same. I though I was going to have to lie in order to ditch my part time job in food service. Nope. My anxiety has given me diarrhea. Free pass.
You should have sold when you had profit, somebody has to be left holding the bag, and its usually the people still holding
You have option contracts that expire in Thursday?
Tons of people got shaken out. Damage was done. Only thing to do now is to buy again and hold. Shares this time.
Well if you bought a 1/29 call instead of shares i think it screams that you don’t know how calls work.  Even if gme rocketed theta would have eaten you alive.
Lol it’s at 312 right now, why would you sell at a 10k loss?
I mean, that's your fault for not knowing what is going on
Lol it’s at 312 right now, why would you sell at a 10k loss?
You’re fucking enormously stupid then.
Hey retard the stocks at $312 is after-hours and tomorrow is 1/29. You don't think the stock is going to raise 3% one what will be the most astronomical gamma squeeze?
No it’s not.
This absolutely did not happen to Jack Ma.
So you think they did what they did today to protect their user base? Has nothing to do with the hedge funds losing their asses? It's cause they're ""morally sound""? Lol come on, their actions today literally caused their users to lose a shitload of money
Maybe a bit but I didn’t see them rising like GME or even AMC.
What stick isn’t being pumped right now? On YouTube, discords, websites, emails etc. American Airlines?? I’m sorta sketched out on even adding to my LT portfolio now if they can just do that. The stock dives when people can no longer buy. Why don’t they do it to ARKK or ICLN or Ford on Monday? Seriously. I’m sorta worried and want to hear the some rational reason why I shouldn’t be.

What about TSLA? One of the biggest meme pumps of all time....
Uninformed or not, it kinda goes against the ""open market"" ideals we proclaim to have
How do you know that?
There's a one-off buy fee when you trade stock of 7-10 dollars, otherwise it's all free.
Harsh, but true.
I wouldn't call change.org ""the media"", and no the media has not unilaterally picked a side at all. And even if they had, what are you saying?
The comment isn’t about you
I’m taking about petitions
Defeatist* attitude, talking* about petitions 

There are indeed some movements that gained awareness and traction through Change.org

Not even talking about stocks here, just about how petitions work. I’m sure some on there are not taken seriously, but not all. It’s better than sitting around literally doing nothing but bitch on Reddit.
Their are suitable investment strategies for pension plans that don't require hedge-fund middlemen. A lot of people do well enough with managing their own retirement/pension wealth in passive strategies. 

The status quo is negatively impacting retail investors (see current investment climate), who could do a better job managing their own finances, without fees, if hedge funds weren't actively working against them (buying order flow, enabling and brokering a gray and sometimes black customer data market) or didn't exist.

There needs to be a force that balances the scales of economic justice more fairly between the 99% retail investor class and the 1% hedge fund class.

Is it hurting the ETF industry to list their daily holdings? Both the passive and the active ones?
He's been keeping people up to date with livestreams. :)
It's not, it pretty clearly falls under the SEC rules about manipulation the volume of stocks, in this case allowing sells but not allowing buys (and only applying this restriction to peasants on Robinhood and similar platforms) but not the hedge funds should absolutely be both class actioned by anyone invested in the stocks they suspended (not just those who use the platform) and also charged by the SEC. People should be in jail for this.

Fun fact, Citadel, the company that likely gave the order to RobMeHood to delist GME and others, is the same company that bailed out Melvin Financial (one of the hedge funds balls deep in GME shorts) earlier this week.

Heads need to roll over this one if the SEC even wants to try to pretend they care about the average investor getting screwed by the big players hwo call the shots.
Couldn't tell you - I'm still learning a lot every day here and in other subs.  That's probably be a great question for r/investing - some of those folks are much more advanced in their understanding of these types of things and could illuminate the math
Yeah you’re the one who’s right. It occurred to me in an epiphany while at work today that I was definitely wrong, but got too busy to go delete it haha. Thanks for the correction, I knew I had no business trying to recall the meaning of undergrad finance vocab at 5am lmao
Webull also suspended GME. They arent any better.
Gave em a 1 star today as well.

I'm sure it was deleted.
no worries :)
I bought into NOK last year because of the whole Huawei ban leaving only Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung to build 5G infrastructure. Sold half of my position on Wednesday when it went up 50% so I could plow it into GME.
Ha yeah, but where's my money. Isn't that the way.

Amazing hypocrisy.
Taxes would cost you about as much if not more. Quite a few brokerages will cover that fee as well, though it isn't a sure thing. I have heard that both Fidelity and Etrade have covered it in the past.
Ah, I guess that still pissed a bunch of people off. That's good to know though, appreciate the info. Been scrambling to find a RH replacement ASAP.
in the morning they blocked us
Some shit is happening I been trying to sell my scheduled sell and rebuy for like 45mins it still stuck. These people arent letting you sell when I was negative it would sell right away
So I found out cashapp is the same clearing house as robinhood and all the other ones. I changed to fidelity it clears its self.
Basically
The sooner you grow up and realize that every industry is evil, the better you will be. Tech companies are selling our data, medical companies are jacking up the prices. No industry is holy, and you will not change anything by pumping DOGE and GME. You do not realize the capital that is takes to crash these markets. 
Change needs to come, but it is not done by these actions.
Black rock will definitely suffer, considering they and other hedge funds made a fortune of being long on GameStop already. You are clueless if you think hedge funds are only playing one side of this, and are not profiting from the run up.
When the hedge funds were covering, it showed up in their favorite long stocks.  GVIP indexes that. It outperformed the market 3x today, yesterday it was way down, they finished the covering they were going to do:

&#x200B;

Lots of shorts now, but they are other entities. Shorting a bubble that has reached maximum reach is a pretty good strategy if you can hedge, and they can with $500 c
It’s a strict numbers game. More stocks exist to be traded on RobinHood than just GME, AMC and others. 

Imagine, you have 1000 customers a day. And 900 of them want nothing to do with this crazy sale you are being forced to reckon with, but the sale causes all of your supplies to be wiped out. Would you close your store so the 100 people going nuts over the sale that’s no fault of your own can still participate?
Yes, and it should be called “cheating”, “manipulating the market”, “stealing” or “exploiting other investors”, not “doing well”.
Crazy the jealously of the ones that missed the trade.
Math is not arbitrary, it’s exact. At daily 300% gains you can get from $1 to $1 billion in 19 trading days. At some point things will cease to function. If that is the goal that’s fine but it should not be presented in terms of a right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness which is more idiotic than anything I said.
I’m not going to bitch about it if someone cuts me off at 300%.
> But letting hedge fund managers drive at 300 while plebs have to stay at 40 is actually even worse than just letting everyone go at 300.

It’s not worse if you want to drive on that road in the morning to go to work. That’s kind of my perspective here. I am in favor of the hedge funds getting their own medicine for once but I am also in favor of halting trading on out of control stocks to keep the market functioning.
GME afterhours is up 61%... tomorrow is a whole new day
But did you hold the line? 💎 🙌
I just wish I had the balls to buy more, but I don’t have that much expendable money. Life sucks sometimes. Best of luck
The dipshit I was replying to said the children buying meme stocks were ‘richer’ than I was. Do you have a problem with reading comprehension or are you just dumb?

Thanks! I also had no idea it was my cake day so thanks for the reminder.
Yup. And the reality is, we lost the class war prior to 2008. America is a plantation, now. Only the extremely wealthy should ever be proud to be American.

Launch them hundreds of feet into the air.
I've used this, my only reddit account, for years. It's throwaway because I believe reddit is throwaway social media. Most people come here to share memes and argue anonymously. Hence it's full of throwaway relationships.
Don't worry, I'm 33.  We don't get homes.  If you ended up with kids somehow, they also won't.  Maybe their kids tho.
That would be bullshit if they could force people to pay that interest. But these are terms of consensual agreements, so there is no forcing.
Specially in leftist countries like me with anti capitalist tendencies...
There will be massive class action lawsuits after today
He sounded so bad. Corrupt, sure. But also fundamentally not understanding how ILLEGAL his statements were.
he was being honest, just his loses
Lock him up.
That interview screams ""someone is going to go bankrupt if the gamma squeeze happens and we don't want to lose our ass along with them."" For anyone broadly in the market, when you hear the words ""we are concerned about the financial viability of intermediaries and clearing houses"" sit tight on your cash for a few days because you might have a helluva dip to buy.
Let’s hope he has figured out a better explanation on what happened than he said on TV today, or he’s going to prison.
I dont wish death on many people but thia fuck deserves at least influence death, go live in a shitty social security paid old person's home for the rest of your life.

I still remember his ad during the 2012 elections about leaving socialist Hungary and fear of the US becoming the same, and he was voting republican because socialism forces the poor to become poorer.

Genuinely curious as a Canadian holding that is appalled after IBKR's actions today who in Canada can I trade with that doesn't have absurd commissions but isn't absolutely corrupt
The next asshole was the ex-founder of this sub, community over profits!
He said on CNBC while live ""We are doing that to protect ourself"". That's said a lot
100% that guy annoyed me so much.
Are there any trading apps still allowing the purchase of those stocks?
I just heard him on my morning news round up.

""Its really stupid to buy a stock at 300 when you know that the company is not worth that.""   Well shit its not illegal is it? So why ze phuck do you interfere? ""A lot of our customers are on the short side... "" zere ze fuck it is; you are manipulating the stock market to protect your rich customers from further losses.  Sigh...

the most sickening thing is them saying they did it to ""protect"" people - yeah protect them from making money off of greedy short sellers. And the old fart that said ""we had to stop the LOSSES"" - no, they had to stop the gains that the stock holders were seeing. It really is so blatant and so deplorable that I can't even process.
YOU GO BROTHER.  I only have 20k in my investment account.  I could have made 8k yesterday.  I can still pull out now for a 100% gain.  Am I selling?  FUCK NO.  this is my fund to bleed the fat cats dry.
Should move away from Robin Hood, they let It happen. RH was supposed to be retail’s champion. It’s literally in their name. They were fake, sell outs.
That's if you can. RH said they would allow limited purchase of GME tomorrow. I'm hoping this just means you can't buy on margin but I wouldn't put it past them to limit shares per a user.
Man, I wasn’t in but was watching the ride (bought AMC already), but watching this unfold I am committed to buying tomorrow even if it makes these assholes sweat just a little bit more. Fuck them, fuck wallstreet, let’s take it back.
Fuckers cucked my bb Nokia and pltr it felt awesome getting to tell my sister I told you so


I WILL FUCKING DIE ON THIS HILL YOU WALL STREET CUNTS...IRON MAIDEN BLASTING AND ALL
Be mad then. You clearly have the money to afford it. As do all the other fucks involved. 

I absolutely cannot stand how this entire story is being portrayed in the light that “anyone can get involved”. So far from the truth but who cares amiright
I know they did. I’m really sorry, and you’re right, it’s f’ing criminal, but keep in mind the squeeze hasn’t happened yet, so you could potentially get back in tomorrow - especially if there’s a dip - whether it’s to try and recoup some of yours losses, or to just stick it to the shorts and help the squeeze overall. But if you do decide to don’t put a limit sell
Lol exactly !!! Stop counting in the states where we are up!!! But not the other ones... lol the similarities are actually uncanny
Oops hehe, we didn’t know you guys would actually call us on our bullshit. Have to put the rules in place now.

Give me a fucking break.
I understand the sentiment is reductionist and overall damaging - but it’s where a lot of people are at right now. I along with countless other people in this country are begging for the ship  blown up, cuz it’s not taking us where we thought it was.
And that is why I personally don’t give a fuck about their losses. 

It’s called fucking Capitalism and it doesn’t guarantee you a fucking win every time just because you’re rich off others hard won earnings. 

It’s means sometimes you gamble and win but most of the time you lose.
I don't understand what you're saying.

Are brokers forced to put their own money in play when their customers buy or sell stock?  No.

Brokers can, but are not required, to offer margin or let customers borrow stock to short.  

So the brokers ""losses"" are completely within their control.
[deleted]
The CEO from RH said they didn’t have liquidity issues.
The whole stock market crashes until the fucking people who just made money buy it back for a steal cause they’re still valuable. 

Just cause they’re about to lose everything cause of their greed doesn’t mean they can just stop it. This was an mutually agreed upon bet, it happens to regular traders all the time. Derivatives always have and always will be a zero sum game when left uncovered
The real issue is that they closed CASH positions and arbitrarily let margin positions stay in the game. They didn’t want to close on the people making them interest, they closed on the people who they won’t have to pay this week. So it wasn’t even designed to reduce risk. It was designed to buy at a half off sale, give the shorts a hand job, and get a free float on the money until next week.
REGULAR people are making money??? STOP THE MARKETS!!! SHUT IT DOWN!! SHUT THEM ALL DOWN
Here’s what I’ll say - IMO, the idea that many of the capitalists that run this country want a “free” market is bunk. They want a free market when it’s convenient for them, so basically as far as it allows them to make money, then they’re totally on board with a free market, but when they LOSE money, that’s when they want regulations and rules (but not for them obviously, for us). So, basically it’s kind of a myth. They all say they support it but it’s bunk, they don’t, they just don’t want to have to play by the same rules.
Yep. Of course the other shitty thing is that when they say ""losses"" they imply it's like everyday retail traders, instead of greedy short selling hedge-fund douchebags
We've spent the last year trying to break shit, and we've finally found something we can all agree on.
Except rape is a crime and what we're doing is completely legal. Don't pull a muscle from all that reaching.
Let's be honest. Its mostly CNBC.
If half the people on WSB actually understood the Webull CEO's take they'd be very upset.
They said this just happened in 2008 so it’s not a complete surprise
Does this imply a preference of buy over sell, or vice versa, or is the only thing implied is volatility?
Lmao I put in 6 dollars at like 0.003 or something absurd I'm at +96 or something now. I want to be a millionaire on a meme dog though let's get it to 10 hahah
Looks like that's exactly what happened. :)
I received an ""all restrictions have been lifted"" email from my broker here in Germany (Trade Republic). It's shaping out to be a history making day for the markets, GME and society as a whole.
I'm sure your mom thinks your ""6 million wasn't enough"" shirt is real edgy, you antisemitic fucking troglodyte.
yawn

selling trading data to hedge funds and bundling partial stock orders with their own orders on top to get a slice of that sweet, sweet arbitrage.
The sell order flow to a clearinghouse- citadel
They'll probably try and manipulate the price under $200 in the final minutes.  Thursday it went from $237 to $193 within 5 minutes, and it closed under $200.  If they can drop it enough and get it under $200, trading could halt and we couldn't be able to get above $200 closing price, which would mean they would win.  

They could be saving some short selling for the final minutes to push the price down, or they could also dump a ton of shares on the market to double drive the price down.  We need a few more bullets to outsmart their game and buy into any price decrease right at the end.  If we win, people can exercise their options to force the market makers to purchase up to 20 million shares, which would push this to the stratosphere.  Not financial advise; all IMO
To add to what the other guy said. The 200$ mark is important cause it would mean all new options release till Monday are In The Money.  
This could trigger a gamma squeeze (forced buy from people exercising calls) that would make the price skyrocket even more.  
They are trying to suppress a gamma squeeze by closing Friday low

Wait sorry how would it be suicide for them to back out? Can they still even ""back out""? How would that even happen?

I am in Japan. Please don't wish for the last one. At least until I see Papa Musk take over the world.
This is correct. They are doubling or quadrupling down
Oh no! Anyway
What happens to the stock people are holding when they go bankrupt?
If Tesla can be worth what it is then I do have faith that it will keep going up.  Publicity means people will buy it without thinking, people who would have never considered it otherwise are now in the pile.
So we actually need more people buying. Every citizen needs to buy a share.
So is this implying the degrossing that happened due to this stock is almost on par with March 2020?
Can someone ELI5 what de-grossing mean?
It’s a wild ass theory that a short squeeze on one stock is going to break the entire stock market like a twig.
Thank you! Chamath explains things so well!
Twitter is great but frustrating. Great cos less anonymous, frustrating cos so many more dumbass tweets
Keep in mind that even DFV's options are controlling a tiny amount of shares compared to the bigger picture. He is just mooning because he got in so early.
You can check the biggest owners of current stock quite easily. Yahoo names the top 10 investors in the shares, it currently includes blackrock, vanguard and morgan stanley
> DFV

So I just googled this and the Wikipedia disambiguation page says that DFV is [""A man on a rocketship to the moon.""](https://imgur.com/a/g5baplm) This is hilarious.
Ya you are right, I actually saw that watching roaring kitty’s stream from last week.
That was me who posted that. I tried twice uploading a picture of proof to wsb and i can go see the post with my one upvote if i click the link the automod sent me but i don't see it on the subreddit or on my profile. But yeah, it was .07 of a share for $181.87 at an average price of $2598.14. I still dont believe it. I tried to sell a whole share immediately after but it sold for regular market value at like $230 at the time.
Any idea why your post got taken down?
What are your thoughts on my thought on this. This situation seems like a feedback loop with an increasing chance of infinity.
Just wanna say I’ve been following your posts for a minute now. With the huge influx of members it’s been harder to find people who actually know what they’re talking about. Thanks for providing some really useful info
... oh. thanks.
Speaks volumes
Yes but that still doesn't answer why they didn't halt ALL trading...rules for thee not for me
Thinking about this you can’t inherently base someone’s intelligence off of language, writing, or grammar abilities.
When you short you tell your broker, that you can pay up, if you can't than your broker must pay instead.

If they go bankrupt, than their brokers must pick the tab and buy the shares instead and if broker goes bankrupt, than the bank behind it must pick the tab.

This is why normally broker will Margin Call you.

Margin call is broker going: ""I think you will run out of money so pay up now or get more money to your account as a guarantee.""
But then what happens to the shares they HAVE to buy back? That’s the thing here. The shorts have to be covered, that’s how the market works.  

They should have been force to close their position days ago
Lmao. Just learned a ton reading through your comments bro. You the man!
Gotta start somewhere on the way to 420.
Y'all are so dramatic. A stock offering would quench this whole thing.
Again, proving a point. The system is rigged. If it blows up because everyone has been betting against the retail investors maybe blowing it up is not a bad thing?
I think you’re giving a handful of shitty hedge funds too much credit. A pillar?

A handful of hedge funds also made a fuckton on this stock exiting this week. Part of the fame
Please remember that if the stock market does blow up, it is 100% the rich people's fault. They got richer off the risky and illegal shorts, just like in 2008 crash. And now they want to blow up the bomb so they don't suffer the consequences of the risks that made them richer. They will try to paint the retail traders as the villains, but this is not true.
Half those cocksuckers don't even beat the market, but they take advantage of whats in front of them. I agree it's dumb/advantageous, and these idiots still fucked it up.
I am not defending them. They are grown ass men, and they're getting their shit pushed in. I will argue that we allow too much short selling. Just because of some blowup doesn't mean we be done with shorting.
You close deep ITM options on Thursdays as a rule?  I am now supposed to modify my risk assessment of a position to include being removed from buying by multiple brokerage apps but to still be allowed to sell because another stock that was criminally overshorted is causing losses to hedge funds?  That's the new model you are saying I should have to be a savvy investor like you?
You do realize that a new day starts at midnight every night?  I posted that at 1 am.  If I had said tomorrow, your dumb ass would probably say ""You have options that expire on Saturday?""
What happens if GME issues new shares? The whole fucking short squeeze is over ?!!!
How did people lose money because of what robinhood did today? If someone sold their shares at a time when no one could buy then they're probably too dumb to be investing in the stock market anyway. Someone being stupid and selling their stock at the worst possible time isn't robinhoods fault.

And if the price never returns to where it was before the sell off then, again, it's not robinhoods fault. That just means that the stock was overvalued. Which it was, because this has become a massive pump and dump.
I legit did not expect him to be so well read and studied...I mean just based on the culture of WSB.
his GME YOLO updates are my daily beacons to hold harder
Whelp looks like it’s all fucked then.
Wait till all the furor is over. Then you'll probably be able to change it without it being deleted.
This is a risky business to be in without the revenue for Robinhood of charging for trading.  According to the article they may now not be in a position to go public.
""it's a numbers game"" is a meaningless statement, you shouldn't use it.

It's not a matter of what I would do, if they are running low on cash and can't cover trades like they promised, simply restricting all trading is the correct thing to do, especially when your largest customer (no, app users are not RH's customers) holds a short position in the stock you just restricted buying of
If you think they're getting in trouble for this other than a paltry $10 million dollar fine I've got a bridge to sell you. I'm sure you've seen the Cramer video where he explains how hedge funds actually work. There's a reason he calls long position holders ""moron longs""
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH GOING FROM $1 TO $1 BILLION IN 19 TRADING DAYS, AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS PLAYING BY THE SAME RULES.

You seem to be under the illusion that you get to decide what is fair and what isn't. A free market allows for anyone within that market to have a profitable day. You would probably block the Lakers from playing game 4 of the NBA Finals, if they were up 3-0 in the series.

Sometimes you just fucking lose. You don't get to ban the other players. Get with it.
OK, so what about the people that bought some right before the INTENTIONALLY tanked the price? Is that worth bitching about to you? I have no skin in this game, but they screwed some people over today. I don't see why anyone would defend that
Yes it is. I'm driving at 40, someone else on the same road, in the same lane is going 300? And their car won't get damaged if it hits me? Actually hitting me will improve their situation because the first person to get to work gets the job? And nobody willl even really punish them for getting my splashed remains across their windshield because I 'should have been more careful'? That's *terrifying*. And it appears to be the situation here.

The out of control stock *wasn't* halted. Certain people were prevented from buying (but not selling) it. This gives those who could still buy it with the sudden downward pressure on price (from lowered demand) a competitive advantage in what is, ultimately, going to end up as zero sum game. In other words, it allows those who can trade, and can be confident they won't be stopped, to extract value from those who cannot.
I'd have assumed they were wrong if it were not for the rage it sent you into
Wow imagine being you.
I’m not genZ you fat single retard
The US is a slave colony. It’s staggering the volume of unjust predatory laws that only affect the poor and middle class or communities of color. Even if you have money, look at what we’ve let our major cities become! Los Angeles probably has more homeless people living in tents on the sidewalk than are actually renting or owning their own home. Not to mention that you can’t get anywhere because of the insane traffic. It’s a prime example of big business coming in first priority at all times and fuck everyone and everything else. The Good Year Tire company and Standard Oil worked together in the 20’s or 30’s to scrap all the EXTENSIVE train and trolly lines and cars that ran throughout the entire city. You could get anywhere in the whole city riding a trolly that likely had a local stop close by to where you live so you can easily walk there

There are epic photos online of the trolly cars stacked up 20-30 high being junked and they look brand new. The LA transit system would actually work for everyone in the community that doesn’t have the luxury to purchase a private helicopter to beat the traffic on the 405 or 101, or any of them a good chunk of the time.
Well I’m glad you decided to enlighten us and truly work to make this world better with your throwaway take.
Tight! Nah our grandkids will just end up in the ocean
How is the lender not requiring you to pay interest on a loan in this scenario? The only harm that comes from being able to pay that loan off earlier is in the form of the lender's profits if anything. Am I missing something?
I think these are the things that really need be brought up when these lawsuits go down. It’s not just the citizens of the US that get affected, but it also causes people in other countries to lose faith in our economy. It’s a much bigger issue than what they play it out to be. 
If the economy crashed due to COVID, that’s unfortunate. However, when the economy almost crashed Thursday due to these hedge funds doubling up while attempting to call the bluff of WSB...that’s a different story. They caused it in 08’ and nearly caused it again. It’s time for some serious regulations to be put in place. Both to protect the economy, and to protect the retail investor. Something like this should NEVER happen again (and not because Wall Street figures out a loop hole to protect themselves again). We’ll just have to see what changes occur, if any.
I'm now wondering what kind of regulations exist for brokers, can they halt all trading like this on specific stocks they want to make money on?

Surely there must be some regulation in place to protect people from this?
They are the rich...do first ask for forgiveness later.
The first was filed today but really the lawyers will make the lions share
I suppose stopping the trading saved them more than they'll ever have to pay out.  Apparently, Wall Street hates being punked by the cool kids.
His arguments are laughably stupid. ""Protecting the market""... This is a tiny fraction of total market volume. He doesn't like where the money is flowing. This is unbelievable.
my firm filed a bunch of them. let me know if youre interested
What will come from this? I was gonna sell my PLUG this morning to buy into GameStop and got fucked over by it. 

I understand that something may be made illegal or something, but will us commoners who bet on
this and lost today receive any kind of reimbursement or anything?
A few were filed already today
Class action lawsuits that will be held up in court by the best lawyers in the biz until a time which the hedge funds have made their cash and are already knee deep into their next irresponsible play. You think itll matter in ten years?
can we actually do something about that ? they kinda own us from the open account agreement doesnt they ?
I have nok from about 3 years ago and would have began selling it off but now I'll never be able to calculate what my losses are from this. I know it wasn't gme but I think it would've gone up a lot
I fkn hope so
yes the same billionaires that manipulate the market and also lobby politicians and own media conglomerates will certainly suffer consequences just like they did in 2008
The class action will probably cost them less.
But first they'll promote some poor schmuck as a scapegoat
There should be mob violence
I’m counting on it.
I’m sure “consequences” isn’t a word in his lexicon.

Money does something to a person, I can’t imagine what billions of dollars does.

These guys aren’t like you and I. They think they know what’s best and they have the power and influence to exert that will. Of course it’s only convenient that what’s “best”, is best for them.

Let me put this in no uncertain terms. THESE PEOPLE ARE MAKING THE RULES WE ALL PLAY BY.
This is where we find out the Republican policies of gutting regulations on the financial industry made what they did totally legal. Just a thought. Someone with more time can find out whether this is fact or not.
He? He is not a lone wolf making decisions. He was ordered. He discussed it with advisors, mentors, stakeholders. He is one, but many have caused this!!!
These are not shadowy figures, a simple google search will provide you with that information.

I won’t be participating in that sort of behavior and suggest folks be weary of what they post online, but do what you wish.
It’s such a fucking cop out. Them acting as if we don’t understand the risks of trading. It’s like stopping a hockey match in the third period while our team is up because maybe the other team will score a couple goals and we’ll end up losing. We’re not god damn children and we know exactly what game we’re playing here, but clearly the game is rigged.
And during a pandemic where a little money to us little guys might not be a bad thing.
seriously, it is so transparent too. where was this protection when people were literally buying worthless Hertz stock from a company in the midst of going bankrupt which was issuing more shares to dilute the already worthless shares.
Thank you. We will win this war and be rewarded.
This is literally the same angle michael burry came at refusing to sell until the last minute
I lost 2k csuse of their bullshit yesterday an it really should have been 5k. Luckily i made some good moves and recovered some. And they still didnt scare me off i loaded gme right back up and more of it yesterday just to try to get back at these fucks for messing with the free market
I opened three new broker accounts I just don’t know who will verify me first...
Steve Cohen and Ken Griffin literally established the NYC charity organization “Robin Hood” off of the money stolen from Robinhood investors. 

Fuck Them.
It’s like when Miramax film studio was created and billed as “more indie, for the people!” but if you actually looked into it, it was Harvey Weinstein’s creation and was sold to Disney. Everything that is done is done for money. Marketing manipulates many people who don’t take the time to question anything.
They are a form of controlled opposition.

A honey-pot to lure in people who wanted to trade freely and take their shot in the market with a greater sense of control, once so many are there they can shut down so many of the retail traders in one move.
Are people really moving out of RH? Sold my stocks and starting over at fidelity
I withdrew my funds from Robinhood this morning. Moving to Fidelity ASAP.
Agree!!!
I’ll do whatever I can.
It appears that you are able to purchase the stock again on RH. Just checked my account and the buy button is back. No partial share purchasing though, only whole stocks.
RH does have the buy button and options button back right now.
From what I've read on other threads, they are limiting the amount of shares you can buy.
Someone posted something about the limit being a five share limit.  Have a backup plan incase RH changes it’s mind again suddenly right as the stock prices start to recover.
So they can see the lines!  It’s literally giving away our position to the enemy.
I’ve seen comments that they’ll have a share limit. And if you already own past that limit you still can’t buy. I jumped on the band wagon late and with small money and the buy button is back for me.
ETA: only whole share purchasing.
I just tried to order another couple for opening but was limited to 2 shares. Nowhere enough money to even think about options.
They will be down when the markets open tomorrow.  How convenient..
Wha?
Thanks. Yeah that was my mistake. I thought I was being responsible with that since I knew I would be working and couldn’t have fathomed that they would go to these extents. But that’s my own fault I suppose.
Regardless of what you believe here, please avoid this comparison. It will be used to discredit retail traders.

I'm just explaining the situation to you. You can be pissed at whoever, doesn't matter to me.
There’s only capitalism for the poor. Socialism for the rich. Socialism of the loss and privatization of the profit. Your taxes save their asses and your savings line their pockets.
Buy YOU aren't a RH exec with a bunch of important big red buttons on your desk. :(
If the person/fund can't cover their losses then the brokerage at the time has to and sue later.
Except that shorts have an unlimited downside. And with the sheer volume of shorts that would come due as hedge funds closed up shop, brokers had no way to know where the line would be drawn.

Along this line. I believe the brokers who were continuing to take orders this morning were the ones who reviewed their clients’ positions and were not worried about their stock’s solvency in the event of an upside collapse.
Your words are Speaking to my soul
Government prioritizes max employment because our social safety nets are too thin to afford any truly major shocks. 

I mean honestly we are in a boiling frog scenario. A million things can happen to between now and when you turn 70 that will drop you destitute. Disease, car accident, wrongful conviction, splitting the seam of your pants in full view of a preschool, misunderstanding a roided up cop's contradictory instructions, buying a house in the wrong neighborhood, having a ridiculously autistic kid, etc. 

Where I was born in North Africa the village left no one behind. Whether you worked or didn't you got tea in the morning and loaf of bread. For lunch you got bean water and bread. And we were content. My family was rich and my cousins weren't and I elected to spend all my time living with them. Everyone was invited to every wedding, funeral, and naming. We all prayed silk shoulder to tattered shoulder. This capitalist rat race is a fucking construct. 

This ""land of opportunity"" comes at such a sinister hidden cost... I honestly didn't understand what suicide even was until I came to the US. A girl killed herself in my hometown once over a singer spurning her and it was the talk of the town for years. 

We have to reevaluate this economic system that literally puts price tags on absolutely everything. If it weren't for the fact that existence cost money we wouldn't be working meaningless jobs to begin with.
Go read this post, he explains it

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7fw0x/i_used_to_work_merrill_heres_what_likely_happened/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
They need to understand it. His explanation is valid. This is potentially an infinite loss outcome for the hedge funds and it could wreck the system and a lot of people won’t get paid what they’re owed. 
I’m not defending it but no one predicted a trading scenario where the losing side can’t escape. That’s where we’re at and in essence that’s what he’s admitting.
Volatility. In essence the institutions that keep the wheels oiled were worried that the sheer volume of potential money that may move in these trades could collapse the system. They had to let it breathe and catch up which involved taking a day or two to let trades settle. That has now happened and things should open back up. It could easily happen again in this environment..
So everyone knows what retail is doing but retailers do not know what hedge funds are doing except quarterly, in retrospect.  The price of free trading.
I can’t wait for a documentary on this in the future...  

Some economist: so these id&@ts and ret***s on Wall Street bet, or thats what they call themselves....found a “dying” game company known as GameStop was being shorted at 140%...
So what you’re saying is... wait until the final minutes of trading on Friday, and if/when it dips down under $200, buy more shares?
Might be a beginner question, but how exactly would they try to keep the prices low? I assume if everyone is exercising their call options and buying, especially after today, it could lead the prices to skyrocket and shoot even higher. What would cause such a dramatic change of direction?
Yeah I'll gladly take $69420.69 a piece for my shares!
And we love the stock! 

I keep seeing boomers talking about the fundamentals, and all I know is that my hands are fundamentally composed of diamonds.
I mean why would you. You like the stock.
Best stock on earth. I cherish each of mine in the 6digit range.
""Backing out"" of a short position means buying the stock back to cover and close it.

It's suicide because that makes the price go up, which isn't good when you are trying to buy stocks back.
Why, if they want to lose a ton of money thats their right.  High risk, high reward and all that.

The people halting others from buying on the other hand should probably go to jail, that is definite market manipulation..
Yes according to the data
Hedge funds collectively selling long positions across the board to cover their massive short losses. The intensity and volume of this was so big M-W this week it tanked the market for 3 days.
Gross means margin. They closed a bunch of margin positions en masse.
It's not going to break the stock market but it can certainly produce quite a dip as we saw.
I think this exposed how over leveraged the funds are
And Norway, which has (or had) more shares than vanguard.
I love that little funfact.
WSB has helped save my pension.
Oooh that's the real reason why Vanguard didn't shut down buying orders of GME like TD, RH, and CS. They want the share price to remain high because it's what's best for their bottom
Yahoo provides the data from Sep 2020. On FT, the data is from 31 Dec 2020 to 12 Jan 2020, where it says that 63% of the shares were in hands of top 10 holders, of course all institutionals.
can you link us some proof on imgur?

Same  thing happened with other people who set their sell order at $5000 and it was half a share sold automatically . I think they’re piecing shares together yikes HOLD
Sounds like someone tried to buy fractional GME and messed up the price they’re willing to pay by inputting their anticipated price for the stock and instead of buying $187 worth they put an order for .07 for $187.
I have it up in other places as a comment.  I dunno, the mods there are dealing with so much spam now.
Absolutely, and one feedback loop was about to trigger the second, bigger feedback loop today.  Until it didn't.  Because criminals.
Nice wordplay.

That's the comment I was searching for. Thank you for highlighting that.

So yesterday came probably very close to a worldwide crash caused by the domino effect you mentioned?
Why do they have to be covered? Are they not allowed to declare bankruptcy?  The shares they have to buy back don’t get bought, and the person who borrowed them money, doesn’t get there money.
Yes, the system is rigged.

But this is like poisoning your own water supply, because the bad guy owns it.

We all lose.
Do you think some glorious new fair system will emerge?  I think it’s more likely a ton of people will lose their life savings, the gov will give bailout money to the big boys, and the system will start back up with new tighter restrictions on retail investors to prevent this from happening again.
Close at least half when you are in profit, I did and I'm still green
Hey I'm a retard. what do you want. 

&#x200B;

If they expire today you'll be in the money
Not really. Without advance notice, I believe they can only sell 500k shares right now. That's not enough to make a real dent in the squeeze.
Because robinhood (and others) directly caused the price to plummet. Who's fault is it then? I don't see how you could possibly even be arguing this
It was a massive pump and dump, yes. Pump and dumps happen all the time. Usually it's the hedge fund managers doing it, and those never get stopped. However, the retail investor finally starts making money on a measly 3 of them and suddenly it's a problem?
I know what you mean. I only joined wsb a month or two ago. On the outside it all looks crazy, but I've been reading their stuff, and there's some amazing knowledge and smart people on there. That plus the fact they don't take themselves seriously, support each other and have genuine fun with stocks makes it a really great sub. 

Hopefully all this attention doesn't ruin it. The powers-that-be will want to be undermining or overthrowing them after this.
What do you mean “culture of the WSB”?

We are pretty culturists
From what I hear Vanguard and Fidelity did not pull any shenanigans.

I'm getting an account with Vanguard next week if Fidelity can't recover my already existing account that was somehow set up by a job I had like 10 years ago (don't have the email, phone number or password) if they won't let me sign up a completely new one, vanguard it is.
Cramer says “Own Apple, don’t trade it” just about [every day](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/12/cramers-lightning-round-i-would-own-apple-not-trade-it.html). I think “moron longs” refers to people holding the stocks being aggressively shorted, like holding Macy’s as I moronically did for awhile. Hoping for 300% gains is why people hold stocks like that. Better just to hold Apple.
I don’t see how nobody retail investors like ourselves are the NBA players in that analogy. They wouldn’t allow the Wall Street Stonks team to jump into the playoffs out of nowhere to challenge the Lakers in the first place. We’re on the outside. It’s not a free market for us because we’re not even allowed in. If the stock market were as strictly regulated as the NBA the current scenario wouldn’t be happening.

In that context I’m not “under the illusion that I get to decide”. I am in fact under no illusions that I will ever get to decide anything. I have some opinions and that’s all. Don’t let them bother you.
I don’t agree with how it was done because it was a move to protect big money. Ideally there should be more concern about protecting the money of people who have less. I was just objecting to the free market framing above. I think bad rules should be replaced with good rules, not no rules, and not my rules.
At what point did I display rage by explaining my investing technique? Shit you redditors are dumb.
Are you bitter because I share truths you aren't ready to accept, or is this just your personality?
I don't think government will do anything. The american government have too many interference from companies. Heck, americans call them liberals and sh** and they let companies fool around with their government. This isn't liberalism it's something else entirely. Biden must be doing something or he will be just like Trump letting the US just die.
No financial expert but it's my understanding that they *can* stop all trading for a specific stock but in order for that not to be illegal it must be all trading (buying/selling) and for everyone (not just retail traders). 


This is why what is happening here is blatant market manipulation by only preventing purchasing for retail traders.
They aren’t legally allowed to do that. Only the SEC can legally do that.
Surely you jest.
“They’re a private company, they shouldn’t have to provide a platform for ...” is the typical argument for such things these days.  

We really need to have a conversation about companies that are acting as marketplaces, and what that means for individuals’ access to markets.
The clearing house that ordered it will essentially get fucked.

The brokerages were just doing what they were told. The problem is they weren’t transparent about it and they look like weasels.
The halts were in clear violation of the RH terms of service.
Vanguard has done it several times to me
Pay a $300k fine after making $300m
this time, no forgiveness. During 2008 most people didn't even know what happened. This time we ALL know what is happening
The fine will be less than potential losses, as always. Jailtime or revocation of corporate charters are the only penalties that will actually make a difference
There are already class action lawsuits filed. In a couple of years, you will get a postcard notifying you that you are a member of the class and need to go to some website to certify your claim. A year later, you will get a check for $8.56 after attorneys fees and splitting the $46 million pool with 5 million WSB retards.

That'll teach them!
There will probably be some settlement out of this, but how much is anyone’s guess.
They make the rules for us, then ignore them when they please. This whole strategy was just playing to the rules, but of course the rules don't matter if they're losing.
Reminds me of Gilead; ""what's best isnt always best for everyone.""
Okay, you scared me more than I should be. I asked for who they are. I didn't suggest anything more than knowing who are these people that make these decisions. But I will delete the post since now I'm concerned.
Yep, absolutely. I do take at least some pleasure in knowing that RH is fukt after this. Bye bye IPO
its a lie, everyone knows when you invest you can lose every fucking dollar you invested. bullshit.
Breh, Wall Street gets hammered by a ""totally unforeseeable Black Swan"" once every 10-12 years like clockwork and this could have been it. Someone is short all those GME calls. I haven't seen anyone here or WSB saying ""Look at me, I just went long 1,000 shares and wrote covered calls"" or ""hey, what color of lead paint chips taste the best and oh by the way I just wrote 100 naked calls on GME."" Some institution's computer wrote most of those calls and the algorithm missed the price by a country mile and someone is going down if GME moons. This is way beyond the shorts.
Opened three here too, just gotta wait for the funds to fully deposit before I can play
Which three did you open with? I hear Fidelity, Schwab and Wealthsimple were all mostly smooth during this.
I hope so. Your vote counts!
""Ugh, okay fine, we'll just limit it to whole shares to keep the *really* poor people out...""
Don’t be hard on yourself
Same exact thing happened to me. Kinda forgot about the stop loss since I watch the markets often and have always said “if it triggers, no big deal, I can just buy right back in depending on sentiment”. Imagine the horror of it triggering at $150 and watching as you can do absolutely nothing. I’m seething.
huh??
This guy societies.
Liberty, equality, fraternity!
5 sociopaths pissed they got beat once!  That’s 1 time of the 1000s of time they’ve successfully robbed retail users.  Psychopaths should be locked up
Wasn’t attacking you, was also just explaining the position. :)
The brokerage is financially incentivized to make sure people don’t take on positions that are too deep. That’s what margin is for, and when you get margin-called you have to pay to lower your risk. That should have been happening when GME started rising and instead they continued to short. People think this has only gone on for a week, when the signs were clear to a good portion of WSB three weeks ago. 

The fact is people got greedy and bet that it wouldn’t last this long. Well here we are. Pay me my fucking money.
Brokerages have the power to restrict trades/options strictly to what cash the user has in their account.

They dont have to offer margin, or allow users to short/borrow stock.
I can picture that Weasel rolling his greedy little hands together every time his short pressure works.  “Haha fucked over another million people”.
Yes. They need better risk management. And the brokers that didn't have it should fail declare bankruptcy work out the debts so we can all be their new owners and put in better managers. That's how it works for the cafe down the street that is how it should work here.
But the losing side COULD escape and they DIDN'T because they have never lost to retail in their lives and they're greedy fucking pigs.  If it break, then it breaks.  Put these fucks in JAIL.

There have to be consequences.  I would rather the government have to bail out payments to retail investors than infusing cash into these oligarchs like they did in 2008.  At the end of the day, it's GME.  The market has trillions of dollars flowing through it every day.  GME is a large drop but in a very big bucket.  Liquidate every short in GME right now, halt all options trading on the stock, let the squeeze happen and get everybody who held paid.  Then charge everybody who tried to manipulate the stock instead of get out of their losing positions.  Burn every fund to the ground who jumped in on this thing even after it was obviously a loser.  Fuck them all.  I don't believe their doomsday scenario anyway.  It's all scare tactics to let them win as they hold a gun to the head of the entire economy and stock market.  Their gun is shooting blanks.  Take it away from them and lock them up.  Let the next batch of wannabe billionaire hedge funders take heed and proceed with more caution.
They could have escaped at any time by covering their shorts. They would lost a lot of money but they could escape. Just like owners of any stock can escape when the stock is tanking.
Who's still short this thing? I mean if today wasnt an olive branch for shorts to exit positions and regulators to get their shit together what was it?

The Webull guy was the only common sense I've heard all day and to.me it didnt sound like he was predicting a monstrous liquidity issue it just sounded like a response to the limitations of clearing firms. I could he entirely wrong and this could be the tip of the iceberg but hell at some point the selling is going to start when the constant speculation stops
This isn't quite the case. The losing side can always escape by closing the short positions. They are choosing not to in hopes of minimising losses if the price goes down. They are still trying to play it, and prohibiting buys in this case helps the shorts and hampers the long.
If that was the case, why not suspend all trading in the shares, buy and sell? It was to protect the big guys instead of the retail players, plain and simple.
Exactly, if you're a retail trader, you're trading blind against someone with perfect 20/20 vision.
In the future this entire process could be handled by software.  

You get a certain number of people to pledge that they’re in an when sufficient market strength for maneuvers is achieved the system recognizes that, tells everyone it’s starting, and just runs this same scheme.
My guess a institutional investor or whale might be convinced to sell enough stock at the very last moment to drive the price down sub 200. I don’t know if people need special permission or a heads up to sell that kind of volume unexpectedly since that’s definitely sounds like market manipulation.
A lot of calls are naked calls, AKA people who sells calls that don’t actually have the shares.  

They are hoping the calls will never be in the money and that the people won’t exercise them.  
Now at 200$+, all the calls would be in the money and a lot of people would be exercising they calls.   
If that happens, everyone who sold naked calls HAVE to buy the stock no matter the price.  
This create a gamma squeeze

They would try to keep the price down by any means lol.  
Stopping people from trading on Robinhood.  
Ladder sales of stock after halts.   
Extra shorting of the stock.
What happened to ""there is no free meal""? This sounds way too good to be true. I mean I still bought 10 shares to say I participated but since everyone is being greedy right now, shouldn't we be fearful? 

I'm so confused this is against everything we're taught. Maybe that's how they want it? Shit..
Sure, if they weren't the same people that halted buying. 

But they are. Citadel owns robinhood (who canceled buying) and also a big portion of Melvin Capital, the hedge fund with all the shorts. They claim to have a wall between subsidiaries of their company such that they don't collude, but that's pretty hard to believe.
[deleted]
Thanks! That's wild.
Don't forget who will get the money. We do. And what do we do with them? Invest so we might as well just buy the dip. Hell, shorters could exchange their shares with ours. I'll take 10 TSLAs for mine or 20 MSFT.
 https://imgur.com/gallery/MwkIoSu
Good idea thanks
Maybe someone messed up some mundane detail, like putting the decimal point in the wrong place.
From what I have seen it seems like a glitch. Other sell order from 750 to 2000 were never executed for whole shares
Gotta put in limit orders for fractional shares
wsb gets some 60k threads per day and 300k comments.

1 mil people are actively scrolling that subreddit right now. Second highest is 36k. It's absolutely understandable.

Also I'm gonna use this comment as pin for your 2.6k sell order, don't mind me [https://imgur.com/gallery/MwkIoSu](https://imgur.com/gallery/MwkIoSu)
Yeah I get that they were having liquidity issues and to stay within regulations they had to freeze trading. I work in finance. What we bull ceo and that explanation doesn't cover is why this wasn't like previous trading halts where the entire order is halted rather. By doing this shorts were still allowed to ""buy"" which they did right before the option to buy was killed creating a false drop in demand even while large order were placed under market value driving the stock price down concurrently. Then if people panic sold those shorts bought right before at high 400s are covered beneath 200. Pure and simple market manipulation using the liquidity issue as ""cause""
Well something like that. Melvin is fucked. They don't have the money. They would go broke at about 170 and we are now around 400. The problem is that no one Margin Call them in time. 

If you believe news articles than the Shorts on GME already lost more than 70B. If you liquidate Melvin you might get something like 13B and the price is still rising. If people hold than it can skyrocket to over 1000.

If it gets over 1000 it will cost 100s of billions. At that point brokers are also fuck, because they don't have the money to cover that. 

And if the price gets to something like 10000 it will cost about trilion and the interest alone would be staggering number.

Wall Street panicked, because they don't want to see that shit train get to them thrown the chain of interdependency.

And the shit train starts moving, when the first line folds. When Melvin and other big shorters can no longer afford to pay interest and go broke.
There is a chain of liability in the stock market that means when one institution can't cover the next one in line is obligated to. When the Hedge Funds fail to make good on their short, their Broker is on the hook, when the Broker fails, the next man up the chain is on the hook. The shorted shares BELONG to someone else, and when that someone wants to do something with them the Broker must oblige. The shorts are in so deep now that the stock has risen from $15 to $300+, that various long positions (like massive amounts of everyday stocks and ETFs) in the hedge portfolio's are at risk of being liquidated by their brokers to come up with sufficient collateral to cover the potentially infinite losses on the still not covered short position. The rest of the market's value is currently being tugged on by the *insanely* buried short positions some various hedge funds have.
It's more like burning down a skyscraper or 10 with no one it because the bad guys own them. Some good guys will be inconvenienced, my parents and myself included, but fuck it, YOLO 🚀🚀🚀. If nothing changes then nothing changes, homie.

The financial collapse in '08 really happened, so fuck them and your and my retirement.
The elite have us by the balls and so we do nothing out of fear for ourselves? No sacrifice no victory. They can clench my balls hard and ill gladly jump off a cliff, taking them with me.
[deleted]
Robinhood didn't cause the price to plummet. People dumping their shares that they had pumped caused the price to plummet. Why would someone sell their shares for less than 200 if they thought it was worth more than that? Did robinhood do anything to actually change the intrinsic value of their customers' shares?
I heard the same. Vanguard has always been solid, and fidelity is great.
Sofi, too
Yeah that’s the bullshit he pushes out on his show to feed the masses. He literally says in the video he would and I quote: “I would never say this on television”.  https://youtu.be/gMShFx5rThI
Gotcha, agree with you there
I hope your week improves
Alright I’ll bite, What truths are you sharing? Because all I’ve seen so far is someone who thinks they are above everyone else without even explaining their point or backing up their claims.

Oh wait, who could of guessed. The throwaway account is just a troll. 🤔
A year ago, I would’ve disagreed with you, but I agree now. It’s not a liberal/democrat vs republican stance. This is just right vs wrong. What these people are doing is illegal and it’s affecting America. Maybe all countries are like this, who knows? Either way, America has just shown that they are DEFINITELY corrupt.
The guy literally admitted that his brokerage helped “premium” members close out their positions, many of whom were in a short position. Literally manipulation on live TV.
They had to halt it so they [stopped losing money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secfee.asp)
IBKR blocked all Pullush Positions, Buying stocks or Bullish Options plays.  
Although you could Sell or do any Bearish Plays. IBKR CEO deserves to go to jail
Prison time if they even get it, or whatever slap on the wrist they get later, was worth the price of covering themselves.  Not to mention the SEC is more likely to crucify WSB than HFs.
And a week later, absolutely nothing has been done about it.   Just like 2008, the regulators wrong wrong their hangs and wail about the unfairness after the little guys are hurt and the hot shots cart away the money.
More like pay the fine to avoid losing $3 billion+.....
Can you ELI5 on the 2008 protests? I know that there were protests against corruption among the wealthy, but I couldn't get downtown to the protests before they were just booted off. No time to ask questions.

&#x200B;

I've had this month explained to me a few times, got a good handle... But 2008? I'm retarded on 2008.
How will they find out who is part of it? I signed up today because I’ve had Robinhood for quite some time... went to buy GME today and couldn’t. So I found the lawsuit and joined. I have my screen shot proof
Why do you think the lawsuit will win? What if they end up coming up with a non market manipulative answer as to why they halted the stock?
I sure hope so. Though I think Citadel is their underwriter? Either way, a message needs to be sent that this shit is just blatant market manipulation and we’re not going to stand for it.
Lawsuits are flowing in against RH. They are toast.
Fidelity has been wonderful to me. They were fast and did every trade. At one point I called customer service for help they were great.
Go with Schwab.
If anyone has Ally they approved me pretty quick. Commission free too
This is currently a bipartisan issue, in fact it's the most bipartisan issue in like 10 years. If you compare it to the vote, the retail traders' plight will be dismissed by one side.
[deleted]
I'll be over here with my knitting....
This is the correct answer.
But there is no limit on the potential loss in a short squeeze.  The stock can just keep going up.
The signs were there a year and a half ago.
Prolly gonna downvote but remember to get some money out of this when it's all said and done. Not what you want to hear but there are going to be plenty of bag holders eventually
Exactly. Give us our bailout if the brokers can't cover. We learned the system is corrupt and tilted in the rich's favor! They'll get bailed out to cover they're losses while we have to hope we don't get left holding empty bags!
Because it was actually to let hedge funds cover
Because suspending selling would be way way worse than just suspending buys.
I think that's what HFT algorithms manage to pull off at the present moment... for the hedgefunds who own them that is
Thank you for the explanation. It makes sense to me now.
Nice sounds like it, the Robinhood story happened yesterday and looks like they'll be lots of lawsuits, not sure they'll do that again. I supposed the ladder sales and extra shorting is going to potentially add even more risk to even greater debt, since it'll pump the price 1st before dropping in value, so that's probably more a timing thing now.
This is a once in a lifetime situation. This almost never happens.

There's a reason we are seeing unprecedented corrupt, cheating behavior from the hedge funds right now. They are more scared than they've ever been. 

99.9% of the time I would say this is a pump and dump scheme and you're missing some piece of the puzzle. But short of really illegal shit or being completely bailed out by the government these funds are *fucked* if people keep buying and holding Gamestop. Since the funds are the ones short *they* are the ones obligated to buy back shares. *They* will be the ones left holding the bag this time. Their risk is literally infinite loss. 

They are fucking terrified. This just shows how right we are.
markets don't make any sense once there's manipulations.

sure be fearful when others are greedy, but with 140% shares shorted means that if we get the prices high enough, they will get margin called and liquidated and will have to buy back GME at any price no matter what even if that means selling out all of their other good investments.

this is no joke an infinite money glitch. espeiclaly if they double down.
There is never a free meal. This meal is getting paid for by the hedges. Theyre the greedy ones because they shorted more stocks than actually exist, which is illegal.

If they back out of their positions now then they go bankrupt trying to cover. So remaining in is their only choice.
The rub lies in 10-15x margin ability of hedge funds. So every dollar they have is $10-15 of buying power in a position. When the risk model blows up and these funds get margin called, we get massive degrossing. Over leveraging has been a problem since the beginning of the stock market, and no rules from the debacle in 08 have ever been implemented to combat this. OverLeverage leads to overexposure ala the MBS market. Lehman wasn’t trading on a cash account, they got margin called and went bankrupt because of massive leverage on positions that lost 80% in a day.
I like how you explain things. What would happen if the ""folks"" in a short position cant cover the cost of their position? Would a bankrupt hedge fund just go ""lol sorry bro, no money"" and the retail guys be stuck and not get paid?
DEPLOY THE UPVOTES FOR VISIBILITY
Jesus they truly are royally fucked. My position at 15 for 188 per is looking really nice rn.
ARE WE BLIND? DEPLOY THE UPVOTES
I gotta admin, this $GME moon mission beats those Eve Online mega battles that go down in history, the $$$ are slightly more real here but with all the plotting and drama.
Holy fuck this needs to be on the front page.
Options boys.....take some time to learn about them
Holy snap when did this happen!? I'm looking at the graph and nowhere does it show $2,600 per share as a price of the stock today, unless there's another graph I should be looking at. 

Edit: Added an Extra 0 to the end of $2,600 lol
*”OH...well this is not a mundane detail, Michael!”*
The price is about right for a full share
Because this isn't an exchange driven halt. It's literally an individual broker running out of money to conduct their business because of a select few high volume, high volatility stocks.
Sorry, but why are they obligated to do that?
They stopped people from buying it so the price could only go down! Are you trolling me right now? Lmao
Whatever helps you sleep at night. You ready to throwaway this relationship yet? Or would you like to scratch that itch to have the last word?
Yeah all countries are just like this, but the US is the beacon of the free world and when you beacon it's fucked up, the entire world is going to suffer. This WSB thing it's much bigger than someone ever imagined, every side of the political sides are agreeing: Wallstreet must pay for all the wrong they're doing and they've done. Getting away with 2008 was too much already.
He even said that he's protecting themselves by not letting people buy. That's straight up market manipulation.
Not them but shitadel
TLDR of 2008 Crisis:

1. Fat Pigs were very greedy and caused the housing market to crash by giving out 0 Rate loans and mixing them in with Iron Clad AAA+ loans.
2. The main protests happened because no one involved in the crisis was punished. So people revolted that no one was held accountable. But the Government didn't care and brushed it away lol

The 2008 Crisis is a lot deeper than that, but in essence people were fed up
They'll just pull a list of account owners. In the case of RH specifically, anyone with an open account was technically impacted. A wider net would be to include people with closed positions in GME that took a bad beat today through the market manipulation and collusion. I don't really expect that to happen, but it would be nice. They screwed a lot of us today, not just RH account holders.
There isn't one though, they stopped trading except for selling. Basically meaning they absolved any possible claim that they had motives beyond trying to help hedge funds and fuck retail investors.
WE LIKE THE TOAST
I tried Fidelity, but every time I tried to purchase it said I wasn't allowed to on an account that has an employer based retirement account, which mine does, so that's fun.

E-Trade seems to be working best for me so far, I just need to wait on the funds which I'm hoping happens before the main squeeze.
I agree this is a bipartisan issue, but what I'm saying is the way the HF's and short sellers said ""stop the losses!!"" is akin to you know who saying ""stop the counting!!"" - the HF's 'losses' are someone else's wins, just like the non- Trump votes were someone else's wins.
How is it bipartisan when AOC basically told Ted Cruz to fuck off when he agreed with her about it being wrong for RH to stop trading?
If there were any rules at all criminals like citron and melvin would have been forced to start covering shorts when their losses lost the first 200%. Instead they were allowed to double down. And when that lost multiples, they doubles down again. These fucks ARE STILL SELLING GME SHORT
There is a limit. It's whatever the share price is. Its not a single person. It's millions. I have sells in palace at $1k. They can pay me or they can declare bankruptcy and work it out with us as a debt class. Such is life. What they can't do is cheat.
I cashed out all of my GME positions on Monday.  I don't have the stomach for that rollercoaster.  But I am buying back in 100 shares today just out of spite at this point.  I don't even care if they go to zero.  I want these people to bleed.  I'm up 400k since Jan 1st.  30k in protest is acceptable to me.

Regardless, they still got me.  I had call options in BB that were deep ITM expiring today, 50k worth.  And they are going to expire worthless or I'm going to close them for a huge loss today because they decided to lump every single popular ticker into this GME thing as their great chance to tank specific stocks that most benefited them, even as the market surged as a whole.  BB didn't have any outrageous short interest that was going to cause problems.  It was just a popular stock on WSB, so they lumped it in under their blanket GME crimes.  The audacity on display yesterday was stunning to me.
No problem man, this shit is prime lockdown entertainment lol
Yeah, there is also the possibility that they massively covered their worst assets yesterday when it crashed to 150$ ish
next up, claims of financial terrorism/foreign/antifa interference by retail market access being too accessible.
>infinite loss

I guess the limiting factor is how fast the selling is when it starts. If it were really slow people could literally sell for a million dollars a share, right??

What's the physical gate on this ""infinite loss"" disclaimer I have to dismiss in my broker app every time I buy an option?
At what price are all calls in the money?
They’re fucking terrified that they might have to get jobs?
But they cannot remain forever. At one point they must return what they borrow.
[deleted]
First it drains the broker then the clearing house then some insurance then the banks then it hits the fed. There’s several hundreds of billions, possible a trillion or more, to plow through before we hit the fed.
Ayyy brother 15 at 212 checking in here.

Diamond hands holding from here
I had an avg. of 80 on my first 10 orders, and I picked up 2 more at 380. I think a lot of people are taking profit, but the smart ones will be patient. 

I can always sell the 2 when it jumps to 500+, and hang on to the rest.

If Wall Street would have just taken their loses and allowed the squeeze to occur whenever the stock hit $60/s, none of this would be happening. They wouldn’t of had to show their illegal tendencies, politicians wouldn’t of had to get involved, and all the other stuff that has come out such as counterfeit shares would have never been discovered. However, they tried to battle the underdog and got themselves in a bad position. Now they are trying everything, no matter how illegal or wrong to win. This is arguably one of the last times Wall Street will allow themselves to get caught like this. This is the government’s one chance to finally fix what is broken in this country. Hopefully they do so.

Anyone who was holding GME or any of the other stocks or bought them early in the morning was also affected, though. I bought GME early in the morning (on Schwab) only to have the price crashed when Robinhood got locked out from buying. It recovered somewhat pretty quickly but I still ended up cashing out at a loss. I’m not expecting any compensation, though.

If the shares they need to buy are all held by people who refuse to sell those shares until it reaches X price, then that's what they need to pay. 

The limit is infinite. We could all ask $999999999999999999999999999 per share.


Buying options is always a capped risk so I don't know what you're seeing. The max risk when you buy an option is the premium you spent on that option when the option expires out of the money. Max gain on a put option you buy is if the stock goes to 0. So that's capped. Max gain for call option is again infinite because there's no limit on how high a share price can go.
Any price. But the higher the price the *more* calls that are in the money. Call strikes range from like 1 to 570? now I think. If the price ends at 400 today everything 400 and below is ITM. If it ends at 600, every single fucking call will be ITM.
When you have the Treasury and SEC run by alumni of wall st, plus the millions of dollars of donations towards Congress from banks and hedge funds, I simply don't see it. If the worst recession in decades didn't result in regulation against this, I fail to see how the current situation could.
Well we put in Dodd-Frank after the 08 crash, but over the years that got eroded away, and the fuckers went back on their manipulative bullshit anyway with (unrelated) CDSs and their other shitty white collar criminal tools.

There you have an explanation: https://speedtrader.com/stock-borrows/

TLDR: 
The hedge funds borrowed stocks from they broker to short them, but that broker doesn't have this stock, so they have to borrow them from someone else, who has them. If they want to borrow that share from someone, they had to promise they will return it with interested.

And now that broker is at risk. Even if the hedge funds don't return the shares they borrowed. The broker still has to return them to the one he borrowed them from himself.

This chain of borrowing shares can be pretty long. And everyone in that chain is now shitting their pants hopping someone in the chain before them will pay up, before it gets to them.

>Either everyone stakes, no redistribution happens, and nothing is gained for anyone through staking.

I think this misses an important point: that staking is a voting mechanism to help secure the network. It doesn't lead to centralisation if your piece of the pie remains the same compared to those who stake and only becomes larger compared to those who don't stake.

Having a reward for stake pool operators and rewarding quality staking pools is desirable in my opinion.

I like Nano's solution with ORV but there's still a few things I would like to see improved. Since the only incentive to vote is to secure the network it requires these elaborate social campaigns to get people to vote to upgrade the network and stuff like paying transaction fees for people to take their Nano off Binance.

As a node operator your incentive also isn't to provide a quality node but to have it just good enough and as cheap as possible to reduce cost which comes with both good and bad.

There's more to this than what I present here. Maybe I'll dive further into it later.
So OP would prefer proof of work to mine?
I can say I never thought of it this way, but it makes sense. Great write up.
The problems accociated with delegated pos (the type of staking described here) and not knowing anything about that node operator you are delegating to is one of the things that Algos Silvio Micali talks about as well. And must be one of his motivations for creating pure pos, instead of choosing delegated pos.
What are your thoughts on something like Algo or even Cardano that  don't require you to lock up your stake? So you can earn your rewards on your balance but still transact as normal without issues. Seems similar to an interest earning checking account to me.
Thanks for this post. I never thought about staking this way.
Interesting points. But isn't this based on the assumption that everyone will hodl for a similar long-term period? The two scenarios you describe could happen if everyone were holding for as long as possible - which I don't think would be the case because people still need fiat. And even if you think fiat will be one day obsolete, people might still cash out to transfer to other, better investments.

Edit: Basically, your end scenarios seem to assume an eventual market equilibrium of some sort, which i don't see as a strong possibility, with so many people actively trading and seeking alpha.
This is why IOTA. Nano is cool, too.
Not everything is pointless. You should research more such as aave or compound platforms (lending). And for staking check waves exchange platform. Neutrino USDN can be sent to ethereum wallets as well. Check how interesting USDN works.
Oh no. Another Nano shill post.

On ETH for example you are missing out that huge part of the fees are burned, meaning the staking reward (dependant on usage) can actually be deflationary.

And worst case predict a 5%+  staking reward (if on a pool) vs an inflaction of 3%. That's the rough numbers worst case scenario. That's an (worst case scenario) 2% gain. Please someone correct me if I am wrong, but let's give people the full picture shall we?

And stop hiddendly shilling Nano k?
Tks
[removed]
I agree that staking rewards are a downside long-term. It's a cheap solution and mostly serves to attract investors. Nano shows that dPoS works without rewards and iota is working on a solution that doesn't require (or allow) users to manually stake.

Most projects that have big staking rewards are purely focused on an early market strategy. They use proven tech, tons of ico money and disingenuous marketing (staking, partnerships, tps limits...) to attract investors and start gaining market share after a short dev cycle. 

They don't want to try to do research, countless iterations and try experimental improvements. They want to be out there and spend that ico cash on marketing their mediocre tech.
I have come to most of the points you make by myself. But I haven't found other incentives or methods for the advantages of PoS
> Pointless staking yield

It isn't pointless. The theoretical supply doesn't matter. In PoW for example, there is no incentive to not throw new coins onto the market. While in PoS coins are tied up in the staking process and are **effectively** taken out of supply. The more nodes join (which can be taken from new supply), the stronger the network, the less coins on the market.

Your premise is based on a sort of supply fundamentalism that hardly matters in the real world.

> While you as a staker would be happy with the yield you are getting, users would clearly be happier if they could pay lower fees, and might look to cheaper and more efficient solutions.

Yes, hence solutions like sharding and rollups, where using the network will still be cheap enough to incentivize economic activity. It's like saying millionaires don't partake in economic activity, because they are already rich. If a project promises higher yields (and there will always be projects that promise higher yields --> already we have staking *and* DeFi), you would do well to fund it instead of a staking node. But your point is correct in principle I think: a staking blockchain needs to balance these to aspects.

> As a small holder, you might be okay locking up some of your tokens (longer-term savings), but you also need some tokens for usage.

So does the network disincentivize use now or not? Why do I need tokens for usage? I am certainly not obliged to pay fees if I don't want to. If that is so, then the rich do not necessarily get richer or the effect may at least be negligible. You throw out number 5% and 6.9%, but these are just numbers plucked from thin air. 

> At the same time, staking decreases decentralization & security

If my last criticism holds value, then this point is also moot.

> If you don’t have 32 ETH, which many of us do not, you have to join a pool to stake. Pools charge fees for this, either a fixed fee per month or a percentage (10–25%). This fee once again accrues to larger holders.

Not necessarily. You can have decentralized solutions that are supported by their own tokens and do not necessarily charge stakers effectively for partaking.

TL;DR: I think your points are without exception based on highly theoretical assumptions that - although interesting on an intellectual level - are by and large divorced from reality.

I think the sharp decline of capitalization of nano clearly shows that its incentive model is inferior.
I would agree with your assessment if the crypto is stable in price, but adoption is increasing and hence gaining value. Like a booming economy when asset vehicles return value (interest).

Personally, I weighed the option to run a POS validator to stake and instead opted for Celsius interest yield at 1% less, but I have the ability to move my crypto as the market settles on the leader over time.
In cryptos where staking is locked, you often get to choose how long to lock it for, which means those locking it longer also get more rewards. Yes, you're not able to use the supply you locked in a stake, but many stakers also have unstaked crypto and are able to use that balance.

I think delegated staking is a great way to encourage people to actually get invested in the system, learn how to use it, and prevent mass sell-offs that lower the price. In other words, by encourage people to stake, the value of the crypto is also likely to increase (I really like how Fantom does this)

ETH2 staking is a bit different, as only validators can stake (there's no delegation), so by staking you're actually securing the network, and it's not really different than miners getting rewards in PoW, other than the impact on the actual global environment.
[removed]
These are very fair criticisms of POS.  But,

Most staking chains also have or hope to have defi applications that promise higher yield than staking.

your main point that POW requires investment to continue getting a share of supply inflation does create a better/real incentive to acquire that power.  I believe Curve and Sushi (to be copied/combined by astroport on terra) have developed investment incentives for voting power.  

POS is suited for democratic/shareholder governance.
Great article, I was super wary of staking when I first learned about it but since then the hype around it might've made me complacent. I agree that PoW is by far the most secure and decentralized system. I'm near-certain Satoshi considered a PoS-type model for BTC at some point, considering it is so similar to preexisting financial structures, but he ultimately settled on PoW. I think there's potential for chains that use PoW indirectly, through Proof-of-Burn or Proof-of-Transfer models that secure the network using a different PoW blockchain.
There is no lock up on the platforms I mentioned.
\> You might receive a 6% yield on your tokens, which seems fantastic until you realise that the supply is also expanding at 6% per year.

This presumes that the entire supply has been staked, and the yield is 6% at 100% stake. I am not familiar with every PoS system under the sun, but I know Ethereum PoS. There, this is very much not how it works. 6.0% APR was at 6,700,000 ETH staked, and APR keeps declining as more ETH is staked.

As always with percentages, consider ""percentage of what"". 6% yield on staked tokens, but issuance percentage is for the total supply, not just staked tokens. Only when the entire supply has been staked, is the yield equal to the issuance.

Some figures for issuance can be found here: [https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/monetary-policy/](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/monetary-policy/)

The historical and expected future issuance chart is a good TL;DR under that link.

ETH issuance under PoS is considerably lower than under PoW. The current 2 ETH block reward in PoW is around 0.05 under PoS. That number is dynamic, and will both get increased a little in October, and decrease over time in line with APR decrease.

\> It might be that you gain 7%, while supply only increases by 6%. This is only possible if not everyone gains 7%. How is this possible?

In actuality, at a yield of 5.72%, ETH supply increases at 0.54%. This is possible because not every single coin is staked. My crystal ball expects ETH staking to find an equilibrium at about 30,000,000 ETH staked, with an APR around 3% and issuance around 0.9%. Actual market behavior might fluctuate either way of course - higher APR and less issuance, or all the way to 1.8% APR with 1.7% issuance.

Re discouraging the use of crypto: You are overthinking this. Usability encourages the use of crypto. Fees in Ethereum are not fixed, there is a fee market. PoS unlocks technologies to scale throughput (data shards for more L2 rollups, eventually statelessness/state expiry for some L1 TPS increase), which in turn impacts the fee market. If the roadmap has the desired effects - that is, lots of activity in rollups, and far lower fees there - then this encourages the use of crypto. This is hard to implement technically, and will take years.
I'd like to point out that staking isn't really the correct term for most of those networks. The original intent was that you'd lose your stake if you act maliciously and that you get rewarded for being honest. 

Otherwise I agree with staking rewards being pure marketing and a downside long-term.
https://youtu.be/qRRRIMmgwbs

What do you think about Harmony $ONE?
Well, you're missing the point that PoW has the exact same problems. If consensus power come from hasrate, it tends to concentrate over time, as the barrier of entry and the costs of doing business is rising to the small and new entrants. That's exactly why Bitcoin can't be considered decentralized anymore since you and me can't mine it anymore.

Network emissions and fees (either distributed or burnt) are necessary as way to keep the network self-incentivized, because miners/validators have to earn money to keep the network running. Show me a perfect way of doing that... There is none.
You expressed it beautifully, I want to learn more about crypto which don't offer staking.
In summary given two options to stake or not to stake, I would go with the option to stake. Besides, there are now liquid staking platforms available like StaFi Protocol where one can stake crypto assets and still get liquidity for those assets during the staking period, creating opportunities for more gains.
Which is why it's called redistribution, by not staking you're missing out and those who do stake are gaining at your expense.

IMO staking adds unnecessary steps and I'm skeptical of any coin that uses it just because it feels better. Simply burning fees should have the same effect, supply decreases and price increases therefore increasing the value of your wallet. With staking, your wallet gains tokens which increases the value but there is no deflation to increase to value of the individual token and that may decrease because of inflation. Ultimately I believe that whichever process is in play is already taken into account and doesn't affect future changes in value, but *all else being equal* I will choose a coin that I simply buy and hold over one that I have to buy, hold, and then stake.
Some people actually want to use the applications of those networks instead of just sitting and hoping for massive gains.
True Buddy, rather than not stake at all with zero earning, I'd say you stake and earn passively 
It's that Important that most projects now have a staking pool, including muse finance which is a new Dex that's yet to go live, but have Partnered with moonstake and has its staking protocol under auditing.
> In that case staking is equivalent to a risk-free rate, similar to government bonds that currently pay negative but used to pay 7% (unless the country default which is super rare).

Equivalent to a risk-free rate, but with supply increasing by a similar amount, right?

I think my broader take on it is that I don't see the advantage of this whole staking/redistribution/extra supply creation. It seems like it's just a psychological thing that complicates the protocol and leads to centralization. A solution without fees and without inflation/staking seems cleaner, no?

> On mature PoS protocols, there are a lot of ways to get more than the PoS yield hence stakers need to carefully consider the opportunity loss represented by staking at say 6% when they could yield farm at 15%.

Again though, that yield does need to come from somewhere, right? Would you say that this further plays into the centralization of supply?

> This really depends on the protocol, on Ethereum 2 those costs are negligible for small holders so small holders are treated the same as big ones w.r.t. to wealth creation.

Do you mean the costs for joining a stake pool are low? Would you say someone with 0.01 ETH, for example, has the exact same return as someone who is able to stake 100 ETH?

Either way, thanks for the input!
>cols, t

wow you just blew my mind, I cant believe there used to be a 7-8% return on us treasury bonds even though you just had to literally assume that the US would not go bankrupt. Wow our generation truly got fucked.
Exactly, staking is not a ""feature"", it's a means to an end (consensus & security).
> I think this misses an important point: that staking is a voting mechanism to help secure the network. It doesn't lead to centralisation if your piece of the pie remains the same compared to those who stake and only becomes larger compared to those who don't stake.

That's fair. I should take that bit out, to be totally honest, because no chain works like this anyway. There are no forms of staking without redistribution, in practice. There are still always fees paid, there are those that don't stake, and (unless you can name an example to the contrary) there is almost always delegation of some sort with the pool owner taking a larger cut and growing bigger faster. Right?

> I like Nano's solution with ORV but there's still a few things I would like to see improved. Since the only incentive to vote is to secure the network it requires these elaborate social campaigns to get people to vote to upgrade the network and stuff like paying transaction fees for people to take their Nano off Binance.

I think that with more actual usage and knowledge, this should get better. But you're right, that's one of the biggest weak points of ORV. It depends on people caring. 

> As a node operator your incentive also isn't to provide a quality node but to have it just good enough and as cheap as possible to reduce cost which comes with both good and bad.

I'd say that's fine by me, though. If you're a node operator, you are likely invested in Nano in some sense. You want transactions to happen quickly, if you hold Nano, or if your business relies on accepting Nano. Running a node that is not too beefy but can handle network usage so that there's always throughput available works well enough for me. But I might be missing something here.

Good points in all though, would love for you to dive further into it.
No. Proof of Work also has many problems. It centralises.

https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-99-of-cryptocurrencies-centralize
OP would prefer Nano. Doesn't matter that you can't do more with it than sending it from A to B.

Totally neglects the existence and importance of dapps and DeFi.
Does it?

Depending on the network, transaction fees can be very low. Doesn't really make a difference if our 1XYZ holder pays 0.0001 fee or our 1000XYZ holder.

The same principle applies to POW networks. Compare the fees for someone having 1000 BTC and someone having 0.001 BTC. Or even a bus ticket. OP makes it appear like this has only something to do with POS.

*Proof of Stake has two possible results.*

That's a classical black and white fallacy. There are more possible scenarios than just the two OP is providing.

&#x200B;

The entire post seems to have the motivation to promote Nano. Just because Nano is feeless doesn't mean all other approaches are inferior. Would be a sad crypto space with Nano only and no applications or DeFi.
Where does the interest come from, just crypto added to circulation? Transaction fees? What happens to the low transaction fees or interest if you have a supply limit? What happens to the price as you add more of the currency into circulation?    
You earned 10% on your Algo this year, but so did every other Algo owner. This dilution lowers the price and your Algo is worth the exact same as it was before you earned your rewards. Then they can't put any more Algo into circulation but people want their staking rewards. What do you do? Increase transaction fees?
I agree. This is the first time I've heard anything against staking rather than for it. It's usually one of the safest forms of passive income in crypto. I've heard of AAVE but not familiar with how it works, if you could enlighten me that would be great. I'm currently only staking DVDX on Unifarm cohort 25. Initially got into it for their hybrid tokens but had nothing to lose when they announced their staking so here I am.
> On ETH for example you are missing out that huge part of the fees are burned, meaning the staking reward (dependant on usage) can actually be deflationary.

I wouldn't say I missed that?

> Yield is paid from block rewards increasing supply, but supply is at the same time decreased through burning transaction fees.

> The second option is an option that tries to hide the centralization over time by not having fees accrue to stakers but rather having them burnt. This means that the fees are sent to a burn account, that cannot be accessed. As an example, stakers might get a 7% staking reward, which consists of 5% block rewards, and a 2% decrease in supply due to fees being burnt. While good for you as a staker, there is an obvious downside to both options.

So yes, the total supply can even decrease. That doesn't mean it's positive?

Thanks! If you're interested in reading some criticism on PoW as well, because I think that also centralizes heavily over time, I'd suggest the [article I wrote about centralization over time](https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-99-of-cryptocurrencies-centralize). Would love your take on it if you have the time.
I'm not missing that point, haha. [See another article I wrote.](https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-99-of-cryptocurrencies-centralize)

I don't claim that PoW is better. I claim that Nano's ORV is a better solution, also in that article I wrote, as the incentives are towards decentralization rather than centralization. Would love your thoughts on it if you have the time.
Also, if you are forced to stake to “keep up” then you face higher taxes from your government because the government views staking rewards as income. So it’s better to have an asset that you can just buy and hold without this built in “wealth tax” of sorts
I'd also say that even with burnt fees, there is some amount of centralization. It's an odd way to structure a chain, since it discourages you from actually *using* the crypto. Those using the crypto, even between each other, will end up with less and less.
""All else being equal"" is the key phrase here. Doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. If you're holding the coin anyways, staking only increases your share to more then what it would have been without.
[deleted]
*...and there is almost always delegation of some sort with the pool owner taking a larger cut and growing bigger faster. Right?*

What do you mean by pool owner?
I think that is just as true of Proof of Stake though. PoW centralizes around areas that can mine more profitably and PoS centralizes around those that can afford large amounts of tokens. One is geographically centered and the other is wealth centered, to the average person it doesn't matter because we can't compete on either playing field.
This thread is about the PoS consensus and related rewards. Nothing about that limits dapps or defi.
I do prefer Nano, and I personally don't see much value in dapps and DeFi. That being said - I'm not saying there is no value in it, and am happy that people find value in it. I'm not diving into that distinction with this post though, it's only about the consensus scheme.
>That's a classical black and white fallacy. There are more possible scenarios than just the two OP is providing.

Either everyone stakes, or just some people stake. ""Nobody stakes"" isn't a realistic possibility.
> Depending on the network, transaction fees can be very low. Doesn't really make a difference if our 1XYZ holder pays 0.0001 fee or our 1000XYZ holder.

Sure, they can be. The effect might be small, or large. Regardless, would you disagree the effect is there?

Additionally, there are many networks where fees are currently low, but would go up with more usage. Even in networks where individual fees remain low, the sheer volume of transactions would still need to additional centralization over time, right?

> The same principle applies to POW networks. Compare the fees for someone having 1000 BTC and someone having 0.001 BTC. Or even a bus ticket. OP makes it appear like this has only something to do with POS.

Apologies if I made it appear like PoW doesn't suffer from this. It does. I have a different article going deeper into PoW already, so I figured I'd focus more on PoS for this one as PoW doesn't have staking.

> That's a classical black and white fallacy. There are more possible scenarios than just the two OP is providing.

Hmm, I can admit ,i see Nano and I get triggered, after the shit show launch it was when they were still called Raiblocks.

So, to summarize, you understand that the inflation concern doesn't really exist on networks like Eth with a burning mechanic. Your really concern is that this way, the rich will be richer and this will lead to centralization of the staking pools.

On that , I'd agree - you have valid concerns, but data shows this will not be a concern at least for a  very very long time with the leading staking pools being far from being able to corner consensus.

https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-eth-2-0-could-resolve-the-long-running-centralization-debate-c416b394e54c

So while I understand the concern I don't think it's real right now.

I still can't wrap my head how Nano ensures security, and I guess that's on me. 
And on top Nano is on a very bare state regarding functionality.. I will give it , it's cheap and fast. But so is Algorand to name just one blockchain that on top offers smartcontracts... Also see other L2 networks.

On the eco-friendly topic... Won't go there more than this. What we need to really drive renewables are business cases where energy is the number one production cost. So mid and long term I believe mining drives sustainability.

As I mentioned in my other comment, I don't think Nano could scale for a smart contract platform; the costs of running the nodes which secure the graph would be too high.

I do love Nano for what it is though.
Personally I'm a big fan of Nano's consensus mechanism - I was super excited when I first heard about it. My issue with Nano is that its use cases are somewhat limited. It's a purely transactional currency, but I see the future of finance-only cryptos to be treated as ""cryptoassets"" rather than real means of transactions, and in that regard BTC has an insurmountable lead. IMO Nano's consensus mechanism could have huge applications in high-frequency, low-cost decentralized computing, aka smart contracts. Many tokens could be built on top of Nano if there was support for that.
I still don't see how Nano cannot be vulnerable to spam attacks being feeless. Seems to me that it's just a matter that not enough people are trying to attack it on a regular basis...
What was the average mortgage rate?
By pool owner in ETH 2.0 I mean whoever put up 32 ETH to set up the stake pool. In Cardano, it's whoever runs the stake pool and rakes in the fees (https://cardanode.com.au/fixed-variable-cardano-ada-staking-fees/).

Does that help?
For invesment purposes, PoW still seems to be better if one intends to hold coins. If you go proof of stake and hold and stake your coins, you will have a built in “wealth tax” for staking (at least in the US and most large countries) since every stake reward is taxed as income. And you must receive stake rewards to “keep up” your wealth with everybody else.
Nano is sort of proof of stake, just unrewarded proof of stake (so they don't really use that term). But the lack of incentive to stake is also what makes it unlikely that such a system could support smart contracts (validators need to take on the cost of running more expensive hardware and validating much more complex transactions).

So yes, Nano is great for what it is, but you do need some incentive mechanism to run a smart contract platform.
>I personally don't see much value in dapps and DeFi.

Why do you care about centralization in the consensus scheme but don't care about it elsewhere?
You are right. But OP attached his own assumptions to option B.

I can turn the same two statements into a new fallacy.

Either everyone stakes, or just some people stake and the network works as intended keeping it decentralized and used.

What is it, A or B?
*...would you disagree the effect is there?*

Yes I agree, the effect is there. For a meaningful discussion it's also important to evaluate the scope of the effect. Paying a fraction of a cent for using the network is no big deal and not unfair.

*Even in networks where individual fees remain low, the sheer volume of transactions would still need to additional centralization over time, right?*

Why would network usage lead to centralization? If your network can scale the fees will be kept low.

*Like what? I'd genuinely love to hear.*

C. not everybody stakes but it doesn't matter because some people just hold the coins to be able to use the applications of the network and others use the native coin for trading or speculation.

In this scenario small holders gain equally as large holders if they decided to stake. Gains are in percentage so it doesn't matter wether you stake 100 or 1 million.
I think DOGE will be the digital money. It brings everything to the table a successful crypto project needs. 

High brand awareness, 2nd largest community, increasing real world adoption, sound fundamentals, memes :)
> So, to summarize, you understand that the inflation concern doesn't really exist on networks like Eth with a burning mechanic. Your really concern is that this way, the rich will be richer and this will lead to centralization of the staking pools.

I didn't mention inflation as a real issue anywhere, I think. My concern is  centralization. Especially in the long run, as I think we're in this space for the long run and that issues that will become a problem in 20 years should be tackled now, or people will divest before that time comes.

> I still can't wrap my head how Nano ensures security, and I guess that's on me. And on top Nano is on a very bare state regarding functionality.. I will give it , it's cheap and fast. But so is Algorand to name just one blockchain that on top offers smartcontracts... Also see other L2 networks.

If you're genuinely interested, I'd suggest my [basics of Nano article](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-nano-why-its-such-an). Nano really isn't that complicated, it's just sometimes hard to find info on it.

Indeed, it doesn't have smart contracts and such. It focuses on being decentralized digital cash and store of value, and optimizes *everything* for that.
The most level headed anti-nano comment I’ve seen, respect. The majority of people hating on it just say one sentence about how OP is a shill and nothing else.

As for the functionality comment, I would argue that adding more features will always increase congestion on the network. Any system that allows users to offload compute to others (eg smart contracts) will necessarily require fees as no one wants to waste energy and the opportunity cost of their processors for free. Thus why nano has no intention of offering smart contracts as they want the network to be as lightweight as possible.
If anyone doesn't realize, this exchange is 100% spam and has been repeated across umpteen subs. Recommend a ban.
Agreed, Nano is pure cash. As a smart contract platform I'm not sure it'd work.

VITE uses roughly the same architecture (feeless) and has smart contracts, but I'm not entirely up to date on the tradeoffs.
What makes you think BTC has an insurmountable lead? I'd say that the centralization over time means that it loses its value in the long run, as there is a prerequisite to be at least slightly decentralized and at the very least secure for it to be a store of value, right?

I personally see very little value in smart contracts, in all honesty. I think the digital cash and store of value angle is far more useful to the world. But yeah, no smart contracts for Nano, so I agree with you that it's very unsuited to that.
Well, using this ([see article](https://senatus.substack.com/p/nanos-latest-innovation-feeless-spam)) for one. Second, because it's not about fees so much, it's about cost. If it costs much to attack a chain, despite it being feeless, that works as spam resistance. Say you had to run a marathon to make a single transaction. Impractical obviously, but it'd definitely work. That's what Nano is trying to do.
U.S. Census Bureau: ""the median sales price of a housein the U.S. in 1980 was $64,600. Given that the mortgage loan rate atthat time was 13.74%, a 30-year loan for $64,600 required a monthly payment of $752.15.""

This is mind blowing to me. Our generation got fucked, indeed.
It helps with answering your question.

No, not all POS networks have these pool owners.

Yes, there are networks where staking rewards get evenly distributed among all stakers, including node runners and nobody gets a larger cut.
Yet another reason PoS isn't so great
\> since every stake reward is taxed as income  


Yes, true when solo staking and receiving issuance.

There is an alternative: Stake with a pool, which offers a token that appreciates in value. Of course now you are paying pool fees, let's say those are 10%. In this case though, tax would be capital gains, possibly long-term if holding long enough before swapping back to native coin.
I don't think that's true, especially long-term. You can see other (permissioned) projects that require insane node hardware and will never make profit from it. They're either (partly) paid for by the crypto devs or the entity running the node has a clear incentive to do so. 

Those incentives will grow with the network, as every decently sized company/dev will want a direct access point to the network. You'll start with small businesses and weaker nodes like now, but if the network keeps growing, bigger companies, researches, whales and more can run really beefy nodes. The trustless network access will be far more valuable to them than a 200$ node + maintenance.

Apart from that, nano doesn't want any other features like dapps, because they'll just clog the network. Once the network is fully occupied, simple payments will have to compete against smart contracts for pow/time/fees and reduce the UX.

As you can guess, I'm not a fan of complex L1 smart contracts for a production environment. It's a great dev/poc sandbox, though. XLM, XRP, Nano, IOTA etc intentionally don't want those smart contracts on their L1 for this reason.
I personally think decentralized currency is important, and that this truly adds value to the world. A non-debaseable, self-sovereign form of currency is a great good in my opinion. I see that value less for decentralized apps, decentralized finance and such, simply because I see little use for it myself at this point in time. Happy to learn though.
It doesn’t have sound fundamentals. 

It lacks fungibility
I'd say that any DLT with L1 smart contracts will always be bad for small payments. There will almost always be a smart contract be more valuable than your coffee transaction. Tokens will almost only be used for on-chain services.

Unless they can somehow manage not to be bandwidth capped, but defi bots and similar will make sure of that.
That's true, I suppose even the biggest lead could crumble overnight if centralization makes a 51% attack possible. As an entrepreneur I really like smart contracts - I even turned to Nano as the starting point before being disappointed that it didn't carry them. I realize now though, since we all see value in different areas, it's possible there's a market for all of it. A dominant SC platform, a dominant user-friendly transaction system, and an anti-inflation reserve asset.
Well, anyway I don't think 100 tps is by far enough for real world mass adoption. Sorry, but Nano may be cool and inclusive, but not good enough for it to take over VISA or Paypal (which imo is the ultimate goal of crypto, at least the payments only ones). Let alone the lack of smart contracts capabilities (to take over Nasdaq and TradFi...). Or am I missing something?
Houses were also half as big and obviously u should adjust these numbers by inflation, or barring that, by wage inflation. Honestly it’s not as bad as it seems
Could you give me an example? Would love to look into it.
Mmm if you are an investor, probably not…

*long term investor
If the pool’s coin has value, then you still pay income tax on it. I haven’t heard of this method before though, so thank you for the insight. Additionally, even though the pool issues their coin, they themselves will still need to pay taxes on profits. So you will likely be double taxed like the current system of corporations and dividends.
Have you read /r/Superstonks/ at all?  Seems all the fuckery of Citadel and other hedge funds could be prevented (or at least caught) if trading occurred on a decentralized platform.
What is fungibility and what does DOGE need it for?
Agreed. Each use case has an optimal system architecture. I think any system promising to be able to do both at once is making serious sacrifices elsewhere.
Yep! I think the latter two might be able to be combined. If you're looking for a feeless smart contract chain, maybe VITE is interesting to you!
True, but this doesn't consider the fact wages have stayed the same, and the average person can no longer afford a house. The fact properties sq footage has risen with inflation, while wages have not, only shows that the people who are buying can simply afford to buy bigger and bigger houses. This is opposed to every decade up until the 80's, where the average wage could afford the average home.

If you think being young and trying to buy property today, is the same as it was in  the decades leading up to the 80's, you're not considering wages and the disappearing middle class. It has affected home buyers as well as renters. This is clearly documented, this article has a great breakdown: [https://listwithclever.com/research/home-price-v-income-historical-study/](https://listwithclever.com/research/home-price-v-income-historical-study/)

You're right, it isn't as bad as it seems. It's worse when you consider the direction of wages. Literally a major reason we need DeFi.
Radix. I'm sure there are more, this is just one I certainly know of.
Could Algorand be an example? They call there version Pure Proof of Stake and you have at least 1 Algo in a wallet you get staking rewards evenly distributed, as in percentage wise based on number of Algo. This is changing in 2022 but has been running like this.

You don't delegate to a validator or node you just get them in your wallet. It probably is a bit different because there are also participation nodes for consensus that anyone can run but you don't get rewards for running then there are relay nodes that are for communication that get rewards from a different allocation to the wallet staking rewards.

I'm definitely not an expert but would love to hear feedback or thoughts on if this is an example or not you were looking for
>If the pool’s coin has value, then you still pay income tax on it.

I am not a tax accountant, so take this with plenty grains of salt.

Afaik the way it works is:

I have 1 ETH and swap it for N rETH (to use the example of RocketPool). This is a capital gains event.  
rETH appreciates in value relative to ETH as the pool earns rewards. This is not a taxable event.  


I take my N rETH and swap them back to 1.x ETH. This is a capital gains event.  


And yes, you are right, the pool will need to pay taxes on issuance - that comes out of the pool fee taken.
Fungibility means one isn’t distinguishable from the other. It’s one of the requirements for a sound money.

Oh I get that housing for most of the world is out of reach. USA housing is actually one of the most affordable for our citizens.

Doesn’t mean we can’t do better. That being said I’m not sure how DeFi fits into this. I’m in the space as well, and I’m bullish, but I don’t see DeFi fighting the NIMBYism / zoning / globalization / automation and all the other reasons why our housing is becoming out of reach.
https://www.radixdlt.com/post/radix-staking-and-incentive-rewards-guide

> TLDR: For most people, staking XRD tokens is all you need to do to help the network and receive incentive rewards. To do that, starting on the 28th July, download the Radix Desktop Wallet, load up the wallet with XRD, select the validator nodes you want to delegate your stake to, and delegate at least 100 XRD to start earning staking “emissions” rewards on the Radix mainnet.

https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/node/validators-and-incentives.html

> In short, the primary way in which a validator node-runner receives emissions XRD tokens (other than choosing to stake their own XRD) is by specifying a ""validator fee"". This is a percentage that is taken by the validator node-runner from the total emissions otherwise due to all the validator node’s stakers at the end of each epoch.

Just had a cursory look, but that does seem like some take a larger cut, right? 

> In addition to emissions XRD, Radix Tokens Jersey Limited (RTJL) will provide an additional “subsidy” incentive specifically for validator node-runners. The subsidy will be drawn from a reserve of 600m XRD tokens, created at the genesis of the network and held by RTJL for purposes such as this. These subsidy rewards are not a feature of the network protocol and are provided directly from RTJL to the validator node-runner. To meet RTJL’s regulatory obligations, only node-runners that successfully complete KYC may be eligible for subsidy rewards.

> Subsidy rewards are provided to cover the costs of running a validator node to ensure that anyone who has the technical skill and commitment to run a good reliable validator node can do so. The quantity of XRD provided will be continuously adjusted by RTJL in order to provide a USD-equivalent value to comfortably cover the costs of good node hosting and operation. To begin with, we expect this to be approximately $500 per month for full participation in consensus, but may be adjusted as we learn more about real costs.
Looking into it real quick.. I'd say that a first ""redistribution"" factor here is that of course many hold their Algo on exchanges, who likely take a cut, right? Not saying this is an issue unique to Algo by the way, Nano has its own problems with people storing too much on exchanges, lol. There's also the fact that some people don't stake, right? I don't know the specifics, just ran across a comment somewhere that mentioned 5.5bn Algo in circulation and just 2.5bn being staked.

From what I'm reading though, Algo will start requiring locking up tokens soon to be eligble for staking rewards, right? It also seems that you'll be required to vote on proposals to be eligible, which I'd imagine makes this proposition less interesting to small holders than to large holders, I think?

Algo also seems to have fees, meaning that that aspect in the post I made holds true either way, I think, right?

I'm no expert on Algo, as you can see!
Yes I believe your above example was correct. I was merely stating that, effectively, this just shifts the taxes you pay from you paying them directly, to you paying higher fees, and the miner paying the taxes directly. Net net, you still pay taxes. So imo, the best strategy for a long term hodler would be one in which you don’t need to stake and lose money every month, every year. But we are still early, so overall as long as the network you are invested in is solid, you will likely make $.
*Just had a cursory look, but that does seem like some take a larger cut, right?*

It means the node runner can set a fee for his node to compensate for the costs. Some nodes have zero fees others don't. Staking rewards are evenly distributed. 

Everyone is free to run their own node since the specs are low and you don't need any minimum amount of XRD. The temporary DPOS makes it necessary to attract enough stake to get in the top 100 though. 

Once mainnet is fully operation this won't be the case anymore.
Every wallet holding Algorand is staked automatically. Yes exchanges take a cut as there reward % is lower than in the official wallets but exchange wallets are just the front end UI showing your account balance not individual wallets for every person. The 2.5bn staked you mentioned is just the stake of participation nodes not all Algo in circulation which gets staking rewards - https://algoexplorer.io/

Rewards are changing to governance rewards were you have to lock for 3 months and vote to get them, so this probably wasn't a great example for right now as it is changing the game theory on this and as the % is higher than current staking rewards will benefit bigger holders not in % terms as that's the same for everyone but in total absolute number of tokens received.

Your last point about fees, are you saying that any blockchain that has fees will become centralised because there are fees? Doesn't this depend on where the fees go? If the fee go into the reward pot that is part of the staking reward payout then it's still evenly distributed in % terms compared to miner fees in PoW chains going to biggest miners

I get that nano doesn't have fees but surely some kind of fee is needed as economic incentive for any ecosystem, you won't get enough people running nodes, validator or whatever any particular blockchain calls them without some reward? Fees are needed IMO
> Some nodes have zero fees others don't. Staking rewards are evenly distributed. 

If nodes don't have zero fees, staking rewards aren't evenly distributed though, right? Or what am I missing here?

> Everyone is free to run their own node since the specs are low and you don't need any minimum amount of XRD. The temporary DPOS makes it necessary to attract enough stake to get in the top 100 though. 

Yeah, that's fair. Specs are low, but there's still *some* cost. Not everyone is going to do this, so many are going to delegate to nodes. I think that makes sense, not saying it doesn't. There also seems to be minimum amount of 100 XRD to stake, which is $10. Not a huge sum by any means, does the minimum go down with increasing price? If not, that might be another obstacle.
Thanks again!

Good to know.

Yeah, and also in terms (I would expect) of the larger you are, the larger the part of your Algo that you'd be okay locking up, right? Since smaller holders will need a large percentage of their holdings to actually use as money and such. Sort of the same as in the real world, in the sense that those with a lot of assets have a far lower % in cash than those with lower net worth, right?

> Your last point about fees, are you saying that any blockchain that has fees will become centralised because there are fees? Doesn't this depend on where the fees go? If the fee go into the reward pot that is part of the staking reward payout then it's still evenly distributed in % terms compared to miner fees in PoW chains going to biggest miners

Sort of, but it differs per blockchain how fast this centralization happens I'd say. My point with the fees is that.. I'm not a big holder. Let's say I get Algo, and I want to actually use it, I use it to send back and forth with friends and such. I pay fees to do so, right? Whereas if really large holders use it in that way, the fee they pay is (roughly) equal to the fee I pay in absolute terms, but in relative terms it's far far lower.

So they lose relatively less Algo to fees, while also being able to lock up/stake a larger percentage of their Algo. They pay relatively less, and gain relatively more. To me that does seem like it centralises over time, right?

> I get that nano doesn't have fees but surely some kind of fee is needed as economic incentive for any ecosystem, you won't get enough people running nodes, validator or whatever any particular blockchain calls them without some reward? Fees are needed IMO

I'm not sure I agree. There are tons and tons of Bitcoin full nodes being run without any reward. There are plenty of Nano validator nodes being run. I wrote [an article on it here](https://senatus.substack.com/p/how-nanos-lack-of-fees-provides-all-the-right-incentives-ee7be4d2b5e8), would love your take on it as most of the times when people read my articles they're already Nano supporters, haha. So you might have a more neutral/objective view.
In your section on Nano incentives all the examples you give of businesses running nodes are exchanges or wallets or 3rd parties that can take their own fee on nano transactions so they have a vested interest in it because they are making money from it. This will only get you do far.

To have big scale geographically spread decentralisation from individuals that aren't exchanging value and therefore not making money there needs to be something in return to cover costs. 

Funnily enough Algorand has this same issue where there is currently no incentive for individuals to run participation nodes even when the costs are small using a raspberry pi. Some people will do it for fun, to get involved, because they are invested themselves in the specific crypto, but ultimately to gets tens of thousands or millions of nodes needed for global scale costs need to be covered
> In your section on Nano incentives all the examples you give of businesses running nodes are exchanges or wallets or 3rd parties that can take their own fee on nano transactions so they have a vested interest in it because they are making money from it. This will only get you do far.

I would say that for exchanges that's a fair point, they profit from trading in Nano. Wallets are free generally though, as are many others on the list. Either way, that is indeed the idea. They have a vested interest in it because it makes them money or saves them money in other ways, so there is no need for a fee on the base layer. 

> To have big scale geographically spread decentralisation from individuals that aren't exchanging value and therefore not making money there needs to be something in return to cover costs. 

But why? I already mentioned Bitcoin full nodes. Nano full nodes are comparable to that, and there are plenty of Bitcoin nodes being run, right?

I also wonder what makes you say millions of nodes are needed. Why do you think so?
Blockchain and crypto is tiny right now so it's not such an issue but if it is truly to go global like mobile phone or internet usage that 4-5+ billion people are involved there needs to be lots. Think about how many cell phone towers or masts there are, all of the cables and general physical infrastructure needed for the internet, if often gets overlooked but it's huge. I could be wrong but think the same is needed for global blockchain
Ah like that. Well, in Nano's case for those levels of access, you don't actually need millions of nodes. Not every user *needs* to run a full node, they can also just use the wallet's node, or run a pruned (light) node, or even ultralight nodes that are roughly 2 MB or so in Nano's case.
Light clients and wallets will become more of a thing where inevitably a wallet on a mobile will act as a node.",,,,,,

Its my favorite part! Forced relaxation. As someone who naturally works alot, its refreshing to have some stress free time.
Am I the only one who thinks w/e is the time to study for nxt week?
Its backtesting day🤷🏻‍♂️
I know the feeling, but I try to get a little research done over the weekend. I like to have a plan to start out with on Monday mornings.
Can’t relate lol. Anime time
This was me my first couple months for sure lol. But balance in life is really important to learn to enjoy the time off!
The pool standing pic is too good
I use that time to study more about Forex
Omg! I was literally just like, ok now I don’t know what to do haha. Guess I’ll watch a movie.
Lmao love it!!!
I genuinely hate weekends. I feel so lost.
Literally me rn
The struggle
Crypto markets are never closed
So true....
lmfaoo
Crypto O Plomo
Exactly, Robinhood allows you to trade weekends, I like Coinbase but it takes a long time for your funds to be available but once you are ready you can trade 24/7 if yo want.
Came here to say this.
What do you mean? You can analyze all the trades you did, test new things, learn about new things, check the market for the next trading opportunities, improve your journal,... etc.
I tell myself do simulation with fxcm and tradingview. But you are right. Taking break is also very important part of trading!
We all do...but still its a great trading meme...just smile and stop worrying about pips...besides theyre just pips lol
Nope. It's just you. You're super special.
It's always anime time for me. Even when I'm trading I usually have an anime playing on one of my monitors. One of the many benefits of having multiple monitors.
Big facts, I’m on my 9th rewatch of code geass.
Facts i been rewatching the asterisk war
Lol
We all do bro!

Its just a really funny meme, lol a lil

By the way im up for the month
OP is talking about the financial markets. Not the ones where you buy fresh veggies. Thought I just clarify.
Thats what i love about crypto, the traditional markets need to get with the times.
Underrated comment 😆👍
Try Binance get a VPN if you’re in US
Yes, but when you close the laptop, there's nothing open to monitor.
damn man I use to pretend to be special
You should watch Made in Abyss. It's great.
Just finished watching death note. I’m going to give this a try
Speaking of fresh veggies... you’re 🌽 af. Enjoy luv.
😂😂 I second this since nobody else has
You only need a VPN if your trading the futures, you can still trade the spot markets from the US. I dont know about margin though.
I hate relaxing bruh shits wack everyone always tells me im no fun and to have fun but they are gunna be pissed when im crashing ferraris on purpose haha whos no fun now!!
A friend told me about it like 2 years ago, idk maaan
Yeah fs, let me know if you like it! I can recommend more like it. Also theres 2 nice ones for this season *god of highschool* and a demon king one
Out of the 436 anime I've finished watching Made in Abyss is one of my favorites. So I'd say it's well worth it and yes I've spent too much time on anime xD.
I most definitely will. 

Them fight scenes in god of high school are EPIC! I feel things are a bit rushed tho but what the heck. I still have high hopes for it.
Gonna be honest not really too hyped about the new anime this season but the returning anime shows have been really good.
What about 

\-Deca Dence  
\-Yahari ore no seishun love comedy wa machigatteiru season 3  
\-Enen no shouboutai: Ni No Shou  
\-Shokugeki no souma: Gou no sara  


Those are decent ones too. Personally I'm enjoying Deca-Dence the most so far.
Ayyyy i see you,Ill probably give it a try. Im relatively new tho into trading and im tryna find a strategy then back test it. I gotta lot to learn and i kinda put the learning off w anime its tuff
Season 2 this year right?
And its so true. Explained most the characters within 10 mims
And thats facts, i want some of my favorites to be renewed
Deca-Dence is great. 

The 2 different styles really do it for me.
There's a strategy in my post history that you can try.   
Also I get what you're saying but taking time for yourself and relaxing is vital to a good trading career because otherwise you'll just go nuts.

My best ideas usually come to me when I'm not doing anything trading related.
I have no clue to be honest but lets hope so!
I just peeped your profile and cant seem to find it, can you link me :3

If we don’t see inflation in the real economy, what your describing is a humongous bubble that will continue to get bigger. All bubbles pop. And the larger they get, the larger they pop.

If your insinuating we won’t ever have inflation in the real economy, I’d ask when has there ever been a historical case of a collapse of society due to “hyper-inflation of assets” and “hyper-deflation of the real economy”? In other words, when has there ever been a bubble that never popped?
I agree. This is what I am seeing.....it is a combination of massive inflation and massive deflation at the same time.

A lot of this has to do with a completely degenerate monetary regime. The only option that the FED and Treasury have is to continue to print money in order to prop up the stock market, real estate, etc. If they stopped printing everything would collapse but if they continue printing everything is still going to collapse except in a more bizarre distorted manner like what we are seeing.

Oddly enough, you have groups now targeting certain sectors of the economy like silver in order to buy it all up and try to break the comex and then you have other groups targeting stocks like GME in order to try to liquidate hedge funds. 

We are in the end game in my opinion, I don't see how this can continue on for very long without something breaking.
Im not seeing deflation in the physical economy, i am seeing massive inflation and i am tired of pretending like i dont
#everything for material standard of living is in double or triple digit inflation right now Lumber Cotton Food Metals Housing College Healthcare etc....

Where the fuck is all this deflation everyone is talking about? So what if i can buy a 80inch TV for $500
I can’t remember reading so many words and
Disagreeing with all of it before.

Your view of inflation is based upon a narrow view of simple economies.  Only hyper going on is the hyperbole you are spouting out.  Hyper inflation is not happening.

Will there be an increase in inflation - 100% yes.  But hyper inflation... nope.

Also stocks are not worthless.. that’s just a silly comment.
Yesssss unity of opposites just like how Joe Biden didn’t win the election but also won the election at the same time.  Or how the liberals are taking the gun away but we still have guns.  Or how we should make a stimulus.  Wait no needed no stimulus required ✨ 🙌🤩🙌✨ hale 2021 the year of unity of opposition
You might find this to be an interesting read: [FOFOA: Deflation or Hyperinflation?](http://fofoa.blogspot.com/2011/04/deflation-or-hyperinflation.html?m=1)

Admittedly long-winded and hard to follow at times, but a fun read when you have time to burn.
While your observations aren't inaccurate you're not really drawing any conclusions.
I love how you articulate this. Someone in another post bashed me for saying we are experiencing both inflation and deflation at the same time. Because I didn’t explain the details. It’s simple f****king math really. Cultural and economic decline. We are buried under lair after lair of lies and brain washing thanks to corporatism and marketing but at the core it’s just sheer greed. Whats the solution. Mobility. Diversify investments and look to crypto. If you think crypto is not a thing think again. Rejecting it is like renouncing running water and electricity in homes. It is the future. Goodby America. You were great there for a minute. If you take away all the military power you have a country sliding down the scales. Europe and Canada too. For those who think the US is still a great country read Brave New World or 1984. Also now, Fahrenheit 451 too because you know...
This is exactly why the younger generation should not save for retirement. All these pension funds and sovereign wealth funds that get their returns in the stock market will never be able to pay the return they promised in real inflation adjusted terms.

You see, the stock market is a ponzi scheme that requires new suckers to pay the people who are cashing out. That is how capital gains works. With the younger generation is poorer than ever, how can they afford to buy the stocks the boomers are liquidating for retirement money?  Also, having less young people in the far future means less people to buy stocks from the older ones. With these combination of poorer and smaller population growth size equals massive disaster for the stock market.

A common rebuttal against this is, the company can always buy back its own shares. Can they though? Yeah. Right. With printed money from the government. A wave of massive inflation is going happen in the future as government around the world fire up their printer and print into oblivion. There is no escape from inflation.
Question: What happens to the meager cash savings of people like me with no investments outside of a public service pension. I have like.. $7000 in my bank account. Is that just going to get inflated away?
Was intriguing but then the dude said “intrinsically worthless stocks and bonds” and I realized it’s basically just a little rant of someone who doesn’t know much but has to vent. It’s okay.
Yes essentially, the stock market and the real economy are actually INVERSED right now which is bewildering. Graham Stephen on YouTube did a great video on it. Stock market should have had a major correction during Covid. (Think 50%+ instead of the 20% we saw) He discusses how the stock market is still climbing and that if economy does well  and reopens it would drive inflation. (Stock markets hate inflation) However, if the economy doesn’t really fully reopen then overall it will suffer and the market will continue to sit artificially high.
I came here to post a perfect reply:

What we see Today is Schrodinger's Economy, which is Both Inflation and Deflation at the same time. 

This pretty much sums it up.
I found this post and replies most enjoyable and eye opening.  My question, if anyone can answer, is how does one prep for this a/k/a 'ride the wave'?  There does not seem to be any good place for money right now.
You have car 'companies' with low annual production trading at nearly a trillion in market cap.

Companies with no assets no profits no staff just concepts are in the tens of billions. Billionaires are being 'minted' daily in the financial sphere despite not 1 ounce of new value added.

You have hedge fund guys paying 50-60 million for tiny lots in Miami where the median wage is like $12 per hour.

Things like 'cryptocurrencies' are up millions of %.

Meanwhile in the physical economy you have collapsing infrastructure, homes selling for $1 in previously prosperous industrial cities(detroit and much of the north east). Regular blackouts in California. North eastern cities have depopulated at staggering rates despite no war and a general increase in the population over the past 60 years. There has been no new cities formed in the US in 70 years etc.

&#x200B;

Hyperinflation of monetary assets means an INCREASE in DEBT.  Banks lend money for sharebuybacks  at high inflated prices which then impose draconian austerity on the physical firm to actually deliver the profits to keep the price inflated.

That is what is happening all around you. The physical economy(labor) is experiencing rapid entropy / deflation while the monetary economy is experiencing hyper inflation.  Productivity in the economy is in complete freefall for decades now due to cognitive resources being diverted to wall street or 'where the money is'.

The economy collapse is being caused by a unity of opposities that CANNOT be modeled using sense data, hence why all these economists do not see whats happening. The economists think that a 'rising stock market' means \*more wealth\* in the physical economy. Its like thousands of years ago where they saw the sun spin around the earth and thought thats reality.

Imagine you lived thousands of years ago and looked at the sky and merely wrote down what you observed happening. All your data is meaningless as you never assimilated the actual \*principle\* behind the sense impressions. You'd walk around telling everyone that the earth is flat and the sun revolves around it etc and your data would be your evidence. This is what we have now for economics, mechanical linear models that tell us nothing.
Those 'groups' are the same like-minded speculators. The entire GME thing is wallstreet banks targetting young deracinated males who are not going out into the economy to be creative are not starting families but are sitting in basements gambling on options \*inbetween\* themselves.

Imagine a corner store in the ghetto where all day the same group is tossing dice against a wall with their government welfare money except its happening on the internet.

Add to that analogy, rigged dice(hedge funds) provided by the games organizer(robinhood).  


Reddit which has been a huge source of depravity and mental disorder among young males goes perfectly along with it for the user growth.

&#x200B;

The physical economy is breaking down everyday as hardly any new capital is being formed, hardly any new families are being formed and less and less \*real\* technological progress is occuring as more and more people are reduced to debt serfs 'servicing' the top 1%.
Deflation is what \*should\* be happening but isn't yet -- basically, I don't know how you can avoid it with population set to radically decline in the next 100 years (birth rates already cratered, elderly will be fastest growing demographic group).  Global population is realistically not even reaching the low end of UN estimates.  The depression since 2008 has hit family formation hard.  In theory, aggregate demand should crater sometime this century, and along with it, we will get deflation.

But yes, due to the synchronized central bank policies worldwide, what we are seeing is hyperinflation now.  It feels ""good"" to finally be proven right, since I'd been predicting hyperinflation from the disastrous/ruinous fiscal and monetary policies since 2008.  But for the longest time the inflation was still not quite noticeable enough that they could deny it (still probably 8-9% / year in some years).  But now it's just gone totally haywire.

The final push to destroy the middle class and centralize wealth is here.  Inception of neofeudalism.

EDIT: Judging from recent experience, it seems that there is a lag time from QE to hyperinflation of more than a decade.  This is what I did not factor in after the last crisis.  It takes time and Black Swans to get to Zimbabwe or Weimar Republic inflation.

That TV wasn't made in America that's why it's cheap.

College, Healthcare, food, cotton, lumber all comes from here.

Using a a cheap TV as an argument for deflation doesn't work since it wasn't produced in USD.
There are other factors for price of materials other than   inflation. If there is more demand than supply prices will go up and vice versa. What we are seeing is that it will cost more to make thing but companies won't be able to pass on the price to the consumer
I think its you that has the narrow view.

There are 2 'economies' operating, one is the creative physical economy that people engage in daily and the second is the 'money' economy where everything is zero sum. The money economy has been experiencing extreme rates of inflation since the 70's.

As an example the value of the DOW which is \*suppose\* to reflect the value of US industry was around 700. Today it is around 30,000. Are you REALLY going to tell me the total value of the US industrial base has increased by a factor of nearly 50? The exact \*opposite\* has happened. The US industrial base is smaller today than 50 years ago measured by \*none\* monetary units. You don't need to be a genius to drive around and see all the devastated industry scattered around the country.

Since the money unit ie dollar represents DEBT, the higher the \*nominal\* value of the financial instruments the more load they put against the real physical creative economy. From this you get a total decline in the labor forces cognitive capability because it is drained having to support the massive DEBT(rents, fees, mortgages, insurances) imposed by the monetary economy. This is causing DEFLATION in the physical creative economy. Just look how physically SICK most people are today from having to consume cheaper and cheaper calories just to make it through the month.

As stocks go higher and higher while the physical economy shrinks they become worthless and eventually would end up with a \*REAL\* value of ZERO as there would be nothing to buy.

You could have the dow at 2 million but everything around you is collapsed. This is where we are headed if this system continues.

14 months of a pandemic and the NOMINAL fortunes of billionaires are at record highs while more than half the population requires government payments not to starve.

There are 2 ways out. Reduction in the debt overhead destroying whats left of the creative economy or hyper inflation and decades of poverty.
Did you ever read ""Another"" ?
Crypto is a terrible currency and backed by nothing. At least the usd has oil and aircraft carriers. It is pure speculation.
The correct and accepted term is “stagflation “ . Unhappily brought to you by the Nixon years...
People have a hard time understanding that the physical economy which is based on human creativity for growth is completely the opposite to the financial economy which is zero growth zero sum, someone loses someone wins.

Unfortunately the financial economy drains the physical economy as it needs its inputs to live.

Heres the analogy of our economy.

Imagine a gang playing dice on a corner store all day. Whoever wins that day gets to decide what house will be built, what food will be served . This is done by the subjective spending decision of the player.

Where do the winnings come from initially? From the gangs own bank which 'lends' the players the money in hope of a return. The bank creates the credit to loan to the players as a debt against them with interest.

Where does everyone else fit into this? The actual producers in the neighborhood that the gang members live off of.

Why they are \*forced\* to accept the gangs own currency by imposed taxes against their creative labor. Since taxes are payable in the gangs currency, goods and services are priced in that very currency.

The entire physical economy is then beholden to the dice players and their subjective irrational spending decisions. Maybe a big winner wants to build a huge mansion, so the neighborhood diverts its labor to doing so because that is where the wages are, maybe another one wants to eat lobster all day etc.   


Any investment decisions that the physical economy undertakes are also actively financed by the same gang bank with interest of course as the gambling den which is the source of 'trickle down' in the neighborhood.

How does the neighborhood \*physically\* look and feel like as a whole? A total dump as the human congitive capacity is left undiscovered and the physical infrastructure degrades from all the funds being diverted to the gangs operations. Welcome to modern America.
Sure. Would still show $7,000 in your bank account, but after a “crash” the $7K does not allow you to purchase as many things (doesn’t have as much value in the market).

IMO this market will crash 3-6 months after everything really opens up again (Post-COVID), everyone starts purchasing a lot more and the stupid “Trillion $ COVID stimulus packages” go away.

Supply won’t be able to keep up with the demand and so prices on supplies will sky-rocket. This is already evident in many industries (wood, lumber, etc). Prices of everyday consumer goods groceries/gas/etc will go way up and everyday people in lower/middle class won’t be able to afford the new day to day purchases.
Its not bewildering if you think about it. Let me try to explain how it works.You need to understand that in a fiat free floating exchange rate regime, all money is debt. If you have a positive bank account, someone else has a negative bank account.

In the nominalist metaphysical worldview the value of a stock of a company is seen as something completely independent to what it represents, that is ownership of a business. Its not the business per se that drives the stocks value but the subjective perception of value that a stock buyer projects onto it no matter how irrational(rationality is denied by modern minds).

So under this presuposition, banks which supply money(debt) have no problems lending against stock because they observe what a stock cost \*in the past\* and assume it must have value if someone paid X. From this you get margin debt, sharebuybacks etc. The lenders \*do not\* look at the objective business itself if its feasible and if it has profit growth potential which can only come from productivity improvements, they look \*only\* at the subjective perception of value known as the last sale price.

When banks issue credit to inflate the stock market they are by definition expanding debt but there does not necessarily exist a new productivity backing the new debt, since as I stated above the prices of stocks \*do not\* reflect the objective enterprise. This means a stock can increase in price while its objective business is falling apart, so these news \*debts\* are imposed on the existing economy.

When the capital gains is realized the existing economy is burdened with ever increasing debt that is not backed by any corresponding increase in productivity. So you get looting occuring where the physical economy collapses as the stock market continues to move higher and higher.

One sign of this collapse is how \*primitive\* the new business's are getting. You have IPO's of low wage unregulated taxi cab companies, primitive bicycle food delivery services, crypto brokers, photo sharing services.

Another sign of this is 'multi million' dollar homes built out of cheap materials in areas where the infrastructure is in a state of collapse.

So the debt based inflation is occuring across a broad base of 'assets' which are in reality liabilities against the real economy.
It comes down to 2 dynamics at play. Monetary inflation running at double digits per year reflecting in the perpetual rise in financial assets while cost-push inflation remains low because wages have been decimated through decades of demoralization of the workforce.

The ultimate avatar of a demoralized, irrational man is the homosexual. And this is who the oligarchy promotes as the ideal citizen. No family, no use of reason, a slave to vice and passions who blindly consumes anything given to him. Easy to manipulate.

We are now at the 'service economy' where low wage menial work dominates and serves the top 5% of the population which is composed of an entire minion class who works servicing the oligarchy at the very top. You have oligarchs like Bill gates practicing medicine without a license and obsessing over a vaccine fetish.

So you have deflation in the real physical economy a kind of stagnation and death, while the magic economy based on financial alchemy is booming.
You can't.

Even if you make nominal billions you still are stuck using the same crumbling physical economy as everyone else.

What we are tumbling into is a neo-feudal economic order.

&#x200B;

Think of a place like Venezuela or South Africa etc where the 'rich' who made off in the crisis are stuck living in fortified bunkers. Are they REALLY rich? They are worse off then some lower middle class chump living in a region with a functioning physical economy.
I think we agree on a lot of the problems and see the same issues, we just come to different conclusions as to what it means.

I know assets are extremely over-valued. I’m not arguing against that, I think there is rampant inflation in asset classes (although absolutely nothing close to 50% inflation per month which is what hyper-inflation is generally regarded as). You can argue crypto is but there’s infinite crypto so you’d have to pick and choose specific ones which I could do with any huge company at nearly any time in history and say the same thing. I think the main thing to focus on is ever since those winners have gone mainstream. And since then, they have done really well but they haven’t been going up 50% per month. But I do agree with the inflation in assets and that’s my point of all of this. This is the definition of a bubble. This has happed countless times in history.

Tesla is a horrendous bubble. Imo, bitcoin is worthless, the mother of all bubbles, and a classic thing you see at the end of a private debt cycle. You have no utility out of it and no value besides it being a medium of exchange. Even if a crypto does gain heat to become a true currency (which I think is unlikely but possible), this is still a bubble comparable to the 2000 tech bubble where the overall market will crash 90%+ and many will “hyper-inflate” to nothing but some/one will come back strong over time. Tesla and btc have had an over 90% correlation b/w each other before Elon bought in. That’s called huge speculation. And huge speculation leads to huge bubbles which leads huge pops.

The stock market can’t go up at this rate in real value forever. It can go up in dollars forever. There are real value metrics people use. You’re not just buying some thing with a 100% subjective value like bitcoin which is pure speculation and can be valued at anything. You’re buying a real company that yields cashflows. At a certain point, it makes more sense to buy other things that are cheap. (For example, maybe some people invest in starting a new company start in which they can create bigger cashflows per dollar of investment than their stocks would.) This stock market is comparable to other bubbles such as US 1929, Japan 1989, 2000 tech, US 1835.

Do you know how insane Japan’s real estate market was in 1989? One building in Tokyo was valued higher than all the land in California! All of the land in Tokyo was valued higher than all of the land in the United States! You think that our asset inflation is worse than that??? And what happened to Japan? Did their bubbles grow forever? Or did their market drop 90% and real estate drop 60% within a couple of years followed by 20 years of no recovery in asset prices (even as they were doing QE) until the whole world went into QE in ‘08. And even then, they’re market has barely even gone up the last 10 years and has only just helped it bubble up a little. They’re essentially in a 30 year bear market and I don’t see it ending any time soon as they haven’t dealt with any of their problems and are in much worse long-term situations than the other developed countries dealing with the same issues.

You could have made the same argument you’re making if you were alive in 1929 when govt printed money to finance war and all of that printed paper found its way into the stock market and people took on big debt and margin debt in the stock market skyrocketed. But what happened? The bubble popped.

A currency can’t collapse without hyperinflation in the real economy and overall asset groups  can’t hyper-inflate without hyperinflation in the real economy. It’s literally impossible. For example, let’s say the govt “prints” a ton of digital money, hands it out to people, and everyone puts all that money into an asset such as copper. Then, let’s say we have a crash like 1929 and govt doesn’t step in. We get massive deflation and everyone needs paper currencies to pay their bills. All those people who bought copper to protect from inflation sell. Or maybe producers stop buying copper as the price is too high and it hits a tipping point. What happens to copper? The bubble pops and the “perceived money” in it vanishes. Of course, this situation is different bc the govt will step in but my point is that if the money is going into assets to create bubbles and not the real economy, the asset bubble will eventually pop and the money will “disappear”.

For the currency to collapse would mean hyperinflation in the real economy. A total lose of faith in the currency means it’s worthless. This means hyperinflation in everything as no one wants it, no matter the price. The bubble can pop up infinitely, but no without similar consumer inflation. History is extremely repetitive and extremely cyclical (and if economists had half a brain, it wouldn’t be that hard for them to follow and predict huge events and see massive bubbles). Massive bubbles are cyclical. UK 1720, US 1835, US 1929, US 2021.

Sure, there’s deflation in some things. There is always inflation and deflation in some things. But, overall, consumer prices are slightly inflationary. Wages are only stagnant for middle/lower class bc the economy is stagnant and the only thing growing is the bubble driven by debt. Private debt bubbles pop and you get a boom afterwards as new debt is freed up and you get more efficient companies with technological advancements, which will put the middle/lower class back on track and then some. Of course, if we get hyperinflation in consumer prices, this will be a little while longer for the boom as it’d be a semi-collapse of civilization. But my point is that it’s all happened before in history, and it’s all a cycle that repeats.

I think economic history is invaluable indicator of future economic events. So again, can you name one time in history a currency deflated in consumer prices/the real economy while the assets “hyper-inflated” in that same currency without the assets coming back down?

No, is it a book? Have a link?
It's technically complex, but if you can understand why a trustless, decentralized asset which is mathematically impossible to counterfeit could be useful then you will understand why crypto has value.
> People have a hard time understanding that the physical economy which is based on human creativity for growth

The physical economy is based on physical resources and the energy to do work with them (some 90% of which is fossil fuel energy). The exploitation of said resources is enabled by human creativity.

it's so pathetic!
>Even if a crypto does gain heat to become a true currency (which I think is unlikely but possible)

The idea of crypto becoming a currency by itself is becoming more and more irrelevant. Let's say the folks behind crypto managed to solve the issue with high transaction fees, but crypto can never be a currency because it is mostly controlled by the wealthy. It is unworkable.

As for Bitcoin, it is slowly becoming a tool of the 1% to siphon and control wealth from the common folk. Look at who is buying up all the Bitcoin, Elon Musk, Michael Saylor, all of them part of the wealthy elite. These are the crypto whales you keep seeing in the media and they control the crypto market.

The idea of Bitcoin is to take control from the government and give it back to the people but it is going very wrong. Bitcoin is instead taking control from the government and giving it to the 1%. The majority of Bitcoins are held by the 1% and they effectively take over the currency. And when that happens, these people would have gain even more power than ever before.

One important fact to note though, since when has the 1% ever work for the interest of the ordinary person on the street? Crypto as a currency is unworkable unless the majority of the currency is held by the 99%. It is ""digital gold"" at best and nothing else.
I think were heading into the depths of a dark age unless there is divine intervention to uplift humanity once again.

Is isn't an asset though it is just a string of numbers backed by nothing.
The physical economy is based on the human mind being able to assimilate being and re-arrange it through the discovery of knowledge(principles). The potential for this discovery is \*infinite\* even though the physical resources around you are \*finite\*. The discovery and application of principles allows humanity to produce more while consuming \*less\*. This is the only true growth available to us.

The human mind can use its intellectual powers only if its \*cleared\* of distractions that hamper our ability to \*think\*. These distractions are called potentialities to sin. Sin keeps man in a state of ignorance where he is unable to see essences. The present system promotes sin and is increasing the \*ignorance\* of the masses making them much easier to control and enslave. Our present rulers do not believe in progress, they believe that man is an animal who must be controlled and that the human mind has no infinite capabilities because it is a mere finite material.

From this belief you deny all knowledge, all free will, all reason and instead base your society on \*guessing\* the future through the observation of what the senses tell us. The economy becomes a mere science experiment not based on findign a hypothesis but by provoking reactions and observing. So you raise interest rates to 20% in the 80s for example and \*observe\* what happens etc. The human misery it causes is completely irrelevant. We are currently being run on magic, alchemy and blind faith.
Bitcoin as a currency, most likely not. But a store of value and the ""gold"" standard for other cryptocoins that can function as currency is definitely possible. 

A 90% dump is inevitable.... but the question is from what price. 100k? 50k? Blatant parallels to the internet bubble. Coins like cardano which provide little to no functionality are up hundreds of percent and at 3rd/4th highest market cap is a clear cut sign
Yes, I agree.
100%. Nothing about our current situation is sustainable at all, to say nothing of the impending ecological collapse that looms on the horizon.
Your opinion, unfortunately, has no bearing on reality. Like I said, it is technically complex to understand. But the thing that is blocking your comprehension now is the belief that you already know.

How could something that is not an asset and is ""backed by nothing"" trade at a consistent valuation for over a decade? Perhaps you've misunderstood it, after all?
this is well said.
>cryptocoins that can function as currency is definitely possible

Crypto assets can only function as a currency if majority of it is held by the average working class. I am no fan of fiat currencies but they can work because majority of it isn't held up by the upper echelon of society in some private bank account.

These greedy elites can literally do things like manipulate exchange rates if they control the currency. What makes anyone think these people wouldn't use it to their advantage? Just when has the 1% ever work in the interest of the average person? The gold standard could work because majority of the gold supply isn't owned by the 1%.

Libertarianism has never worked and will never work. Just how does taking power away from corrupt governments and giving it to the 1% solve anything?
Lol someone clearly hasn’t done their homework on Cardano 😂
Consistent valuation means different things to you and me. It also is not hard to understand. It is an electronic distribution of a ledger. Super simple. I was a big early proponent but it is a terrible currency.
I have but feel free to enlighten me
I was confused by your insistence that it is ""backed by nothing"". That's sort of the point, to avoid the necessity of imprimatur by an authority.

Take gold for instance - is gold ""backed by"" anything? Does its value depend on being backed by something?
If out of all you’ve learned from Cardano is it, “provides little to no functionality” then I can easily cal out BS. It’s the equivalent of critiquing on a movie you’ve never seen, but you have regurgitated talking points you’ve picked up on to try to remain relevant.
Gold is also a bad currency. It shares many of the same issues as btc. If I had realized btc was digital gold instead of a spendable dollar I would have kept some.instead of spending it all and being bitter about believing.
40k transactions a day 31 billion supply not even decentralized yet. You can pretty much only send and receive. 4.4% apy

Algo 10 billion supply up to 1M transactions does almodt everything cardano only PLANS to do. 7.4% apy

Yes
Wealth inequality tends to have an exponential blowout historically. We are just barely hitting the beginning of the curve. 

Economic rents will converge to consume all income above the subsistence level for at least 90% of the population. 

check back in in 8 years and see what the situation is.
The US has adopted a european style, specifically anglo-saxon feudal economy since about the 70's. This has given birth to a new rentier class composed entirely of people who aren't even generational Americans. 

The visitors have setup tents inside the ruins of America.

The consequence is a collapsing birth rate and general stagnation. With the 'green new deal' stimulus this will accelerate into lack of energy infrastructure to maintain a high output industrial civilization.

High costs of living with more and more people dependant on modern oligarchs for their wellbeing is what you can expect if this continues on.

For example largh swaths of homes were turned into landlord-rentier by wallstreet after the 08 crash under Obama. Coupled with the silicon valley-new internet hollywood brainwashing piped into everyones home and you get the situation we are currently stuck in.
Can rents go up a lot more? If wages (/govt subsidies) follow, sure. But if wages don’t follow, you can’t charge someone more for rent than they can physically pay. Housing is already in a bubble. In nominal terms, it can technically grow forever, but in real terms, I don’t see housing or rents getting much higher.

Inflation can outpace growth infinitely. Every fiat currency in history has hyper-inflated to the value of 0 with exception of a large handful of currencies the last 50 years.

Maybe rent will be $2,000 a month. Maybe min wage will be 30/hr and med wages will be 100k. But rent can’t go up forever without wages also increasing.

A collapse is not inevitable but a crash is. The world is over-indebted. 2008 was a major private debt crisis. The first one since 1929. In 1929, people, companies, and banks defaulted on their debts bc deflation forced them to. This time, govt stopped a lot of that by printing. Due to that, debts weren’t defaulted as much and the world is still over-indebted and HAVE to pay off/default on their debts. For the last 12 years, The Fed Reserve/ govt has been fighting this deflationary depression. Their goal seems to be to try to slowly inflate the debt by creating moderate inflation. However, as this happens, corporations just add more debt bc it’s more attractive as rates go more negative. So debt isn’t deleveraged, it’s added which is the opposite of what NEEDS to happen. My point is that debt in the private sector is too high so it MUST get worse before it gets better since private sector debt/GDP must be lowered which is painful. If the govt left everything alone, we would have a massive deflationary crash (followed by a boom as the bad debts would be cleared from the economy). So a collapse is not inevitable. The govt may lose the battle to deflation.

Also, the top 10% were hurt the most in terms of wealth % during the Great Depression. Stocks went down in value while cash went up. Rich hold stocks, poor/middle class hold cash. Of course, this may time be different (and I think it will). Inflation may win, and in a scenario where huge inflation wins, the top 10% don’t win. The top .0001% with political insiders are the only ones able to see ahead and shift wealth to certain places ahead of time or have the poltical insiders shift wealth/ new currency to them during/after the collapse. Venezuela’s stock market went down 99%+ in real terms. The top 10% did not win. The few in political power didn’t do as bad.

Keep in mind, inflation is a tax. The govt controls the supply of money. So inflation will continue for as long as the govt continues to tax this way, or, of course it could continue regardless of govt if people lose faith.
One of the things that we all need to consider is the impact of Zero Interest Rate Policy. Much of the inflation around the housing market has to do with historically low interest rates, pushing the prices up.

Another thing that probably needs to be considered: the effects you are describing, at least in the housing market, don't apply the same way across generations. People who bought a house in, say, the 80s or 90s have seen their assets appreciate significantly. Those of us that have entered the housing market in the 2000s have been faced with a different story.

This isn't to say that the system isn't broken. But it is interesting to see specific aspects at play.
No they won't. The next thing in the upcoming weeks and months will be a deflationary depression.
Interest rates go up, economy slows down. High cash liquidity owners get a sale of assets. 

That would have been a traditional way. With MMT its weirder.
Yes.  I recently traveled to south America and that's how a lot of people live.  Even middle class single men can't afford an apartment unless they rent it as a group.  The food they eat is very heavy on beans,  rice,  and locally grown vegetables and fruits because that's what they can afford.  Privately owned cars are very rare and many families chip in to get a motorcycle for family use.  It's like a modern day dark ages where society is separated by class.  The very rich,  and the very poor.  It's headed that way in the USA now.  Young people,  even the ones that work can't afford housing or healthcare. Tennessee listed 257,000 jobs on their website.  Only 8500 of them paid more than 20,000 dollars a year!
No, because eventually voting works.
No. They will go down. We are in an inflationary bubble. I'm older & have been through it 3 times in my life. Inflation is awful. If you have saved anything don't be scared to buy when things burst but realize deflation can last a long time & it will also feel like you are trapped in quicksand. Be a contrarian.  Buy when it seems hopeless, hang on & sell when things are high, when everyone else wants to buy.
The government wants the general population poor as it generally gives them more control (welfare). A good chunk of the rich would hurt if the general populace can't afford basic necessities such as rent and utilities
Rich people approve of this, so... yes.
Wait until the Fed published the fomc minutes because it's at that point when prices will go to the moon as the dollar hits zero either this evening or before you even wake up tomorrow morning. That being said, it won't matter at that point because price rises will be the least of your or anyone else's concerns as a worthless dollar will bring about Venus Syndrome and kill every living thing on the planet within two or three days

Inflation has been here for a decade, it’s escalating now. Protect yourselves at r/wallstreetsilver
Yet everywhere I look companies are saying employees aren’t coming to work which is causing shortages and delays which makes prices go up. Government paying them too much to stay home. Everyone else is working their butt off. Current Government stated clearly they wanted/needed inflation as it was a good thing. Blame the people that voted based not on what’s great for the country but based on how government divides everyone into groups in order to get votes. 🤔 The overkill in the media/entertainment is so obvious and needs to stop.

I am embarrassed to say I voted for Joe, but some of his policies- like the vaccine mandate- are taking away hope & jobs from people. The fact that the government is trying to push medical mandates on people is something we only saw in Nazi Germany- not is the US. People are living in fear that they will lose their job, get sick, lose their insurance, and not be able to feed their family.

I concur.  It is going on slowly right now as we speak. We pay 'rent' on everything.  Streaming services are 'rent' in a recreational sense; but many may, or may not realize that small businesses also have to 'rent' business software services.  All the -monopolies-  have you paying a subscription fee for everything.  This is killing smaller businesses everywhere. Economic rent.  Wages are a part of the overhead and therefore can somewhat be controlled.

>The govt may lose the battle to deflation.

We have a K shaped recovery or should I say a K shaped economy. On one side we have the real economy that is in the toilet and on the other the financials that is blooming. Yeah right, the rich will get to enjoy prices going down because they are getting ever wealthier.    
  
The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and that basket is different for each person. You can have high inflation rates in food and deflation in other stuff. A true inflation means a decrease in purchasing power in everything for everyone rich and poor. But we don't see that happening.   
  
For example, the CPI basket might be deflationary for a rich person who spends most of his money on luxury products. For a poor person with food making up most of the spending it would be inflationary. There is just no way to effectively measure changes in prices from using a basket of goods when all it calculates is the average.
> Can rents go up a lot more? 

Of course they can go up.  You can always just add roommates.  

There are three young women who rent a nice sized house across the street from me.  The one young lady told me she wished she could have a place of her own without the roommates. I casually asked what the rent was, and she replied $2400 a month.  But they split it three ways so....
When Tennessee listed the jobs, was that supposed to be a list of all the jobs in Tennessee, or just the ones that were up for grabs? I imagine that the job of “corporate lawyer”, or whatever would not be on that list, so I’m hoping that Tennessee has a lot of well paying jobs, they are just not listed on a job board.
Have you tried finding a job outside a city that is equivalent to the cost of living relative? Have you done a cross analysis of cost of living to income ratios on the county Level. Presently only Oklahoma, South Dakota and Nebraska are leverageable in that way. Also northern Minnesota. Even so even if you lower your ambitions you are looking at 4-6 roommates with no children. That being said that is the rate of pay for the jobs on offer. And you would be financially stable at that point. Avg rate of pay would need to double or rents and medicine half for things to look sustainable outside of these micro regions.

You should check out the first episode of Pitchfork Economics.

https://pitchforkeconomics.com/episode/why-do-we-call-it-pitchfork-economics/

It has Walter Scheidel as a guest who is a historian at Stanford. The most frequently cited active-duty Roman historian adjusted for age in the Western Hemisphere, Scheidel is the author or (co-)editor of 20 books, including The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality.

But he ultimately argues that the only equalizing events in history come at great calamity. Calls them the 4 or 5 horsemen or something. It's all quite depressing that we know what's going to happen but lack the will and selflessness to change our course.
Its too late for that
Yep, the US adopted anglosaxon economics in the 1970's which are entirely based on rents and usury.  


The world is heading into a major multi-generational stagnation period where technology is used to exploit instead of uplift.
We can call inflation an increase in the purchasing power of a dollar if you want but I think it’s a weird way to define it as an increase in one’s purchasing power with regards to someone’s financial assets. That makes it nearly impossible to calculate and highly variant. It also ignores the fact that there’s inflation in financial assets and the fact that financial assets are more expensive to buy.

Inflation from luxury products has been pretty high the last decade when compared to other things. When rich people have more money, they bid up prices on things such as luxury products and financial assets. So it’s actually the opposite. There’s been more inflation on things the rich spend money on (such as financial assets) than the poor due to them making a % increase in wages and bidding up prices. But yeah, I agree, it’s impossible for CPI to 100% accurately measure inflation for every person since everyone has different spending habits. And especially considering govt calculates it.

And like you said, the only thing doing well is financials. What happens if people think the CFs they’ll get from those assets will be atrocious? Cyclical P/E ratio is already higher than 1929. Stocks aren’t just something that people can bid up higher forever regardless of price. They’re real companies with real CFs. At a certain point, it makes more sense to invest that money into a different asset that can yield higher CFs or retain purchasing power.
Exactly. That means she limits what she pays. She can only afford $800. She can’t afford her own place. This means her demand for her amount of housing is lower than it may be at a “normal time” of housing/rent prices bc she is demanding “less of a product”. Lower demand over times results in lower prices.

People can only pay what they can afford. And if everyone starts rooming together to save money, that means less landlords will be able to find renters since the renters are sharing houses. In this case, there would be an excess of houses per se. Some landlords could lower the price to attract renters, miss payments and foreclose/go bankrupt, sell the house at a lower price than they might have thought they could’ve gotten, etc etc etc. But like I said, it can continue to noticeably go up if demand for housing (aka wages/subsidies) increases in accordance

Edit: misread what you said a little, changed wording
Tennessee does have some high paying jobs like most other places.  However the listing was supposed to be available jobs.  It's still a pretty bad problem.  The local subway restaurant pays their employees 8 dollars per hour and one free meal per shift.  I'm a nurse currently and I get 20$ an hour which is now under paid thanks to the recent inflation.  I know a few RNs with years of experience that make around 35 to 40 an hour.   Cheap apartments around here are about 900 to 1100 a month.  Car insurance, car payments, fuel, food, taxes,  maintenance for the car and medical insurance are just more than most jobs will pay for. Most jobs in my region pay less than 18$ per hour and the benefits vary. Record profits are unpaid wages in many cases.

I’m in Arizona. Same situation here. I can tell you having worked retail during the first seven months last year at a corporate job, I was treated terribly. I’d have men waiting outside for me after my shift was over and law enforcement isn’t any good because they’re 40 minutes away. We would have no help. And no backup. At least now with my job at a non-corporate restaurant, my boss ensures my safety.

>Stocks aren’t just something that people can bid up higher forever regardless of price. 

Of course they can especially with low interest rate and QE. Except it will not be in inflation adjusted terms. The [Ponzi nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Az1dpnC4AxA) of capital gains makes the impossible possible. Nobody in the west really cares about cash flow nowadays since companies can get away from paying little to no dividends. If dividend is valued more than capital gains, then perhaps this massive ponzi scheme would then finally get exposed. You can't pay a dividend when there is no profit.

>When rich people have more money, they bid up prices on things such as luxury products and financial assets.

Not all luxury products are equal though. An item can be considered a luxury product but if rich people don't really desire it due to some reasons, they are not going to bid up the price. Perhaps something like a used sports car is a luxury product but the rich probably would pay extra for it.
The problem with free float fiat money is there is no \*objective\* measure of value connected to it.

Because of that the banking system can inflate the amount of dollars arbitrary by lending them at whatever price is deemed the 'market'. They use an arbitrary concept like market forces while ignoring that there is SOMEONE in that very market, its not just a magicball that produces the prices. They also lend against whatever assets they please, usually these are existing assets like real estate. The entire economy then becomes a real estate economy etc.

Inflation is a result of 2 things. 1) deadweight overhead processes imposed into the cost structure, ie landlords raise rents, bondholders demand more payments out of a utility which is forced to raise prices, shareholders want more dividends etc 2) entropic decay of infrastructure from lack of innovation due to a debased workforce. For example an ageing powerplant running on some ancient technology that is constantly patched up as it uses up more inputs to produce lower outputs. A overloaded bridge that slows down traffic causing persistent delays.

So dead weight markup + crumbling infrastructure causes inflation. Its not a mysterious force like economists claim.
Somethings going to have to happen, this is not sustainable. $20 an hour is not nearly enough for a highly trained professional. That’s terrible.

Are you talking about the pandemic? Because if you are you should know that the herd's response to the pandemic would've been about the same effect.

https://syndromictrends.com/

There is no government policy that caused that reduction from the end of Feb to June. People did it all on their own. You can look all through last year and see where ever an outbreak of COVID happens, there is a natural inclination of people to isolate, reduce exposure, reduce risk, etc... The shutdowns were just a formality really effecting the outliers who were too arrogant or stupid to look out for themselves and others.

I should have worded that more clearly. I didn’t mean regardless of price in terms of dollars. I meant price in terms of the valuation and how much it costs in real terms, not nominal. In terms of dollars, I agree, stocks can go up forever
Most of the SP500 firms have been financialized. For example take Boeing. Last year they sold $30 billion of debt and they sold $60 bil of their 'side business' which is making planes.

The proceeds from the debt sales go into sharebuybacks, which increases the EPS faster than innovating new planes. Over the last decade they spent more on sharebuybacks than investments into the core business. This is how companies who are relatively stagnant can deliver share price returns. University economics looks at past returns and produces a median which then they forecast the future with, completely \*ignoring\* the principle of WHY and WHERE do the profits come from.

What happens is as the stock goes up there is new nominal financial IOU's being created with no backing in the creative economy. When these IOU's are then spent into the economy its a form of looting, hence you get this bizaare looking society where one guys house costs $50 million and all around him are shacks and potholed roads. This is very similar to what society looked like in the excesses of the dark ages.

Now since the majority of wallstreet 'gains' are in the form of gambling and not value-creative work, when the finance guys spend money they have no concept of what it is worth. Its like a lotto winner. The money becomes so abstract that it is worthless in the minds of the gamblers.
People frequently question why we have a shortage of nurses in the USA.  I was an honor grad from my school of nursing,  I had 10 years of experience when my current place of employment hired me. They were paying 17.50 and have to their credit increased my pay since then but I am one of the few that seems to expect yearly wages to increase.  It's sad to see so many young people who are very interested in working to be the butt of scornful remarks on tv etc. ( No one wants to work anymore. )  and (I bet you still live in your parents house. ) what they should be saying is why doesn't corporate america want to pay reasonable wages anymore and why can't full time employees afford housing and health care? I mean,  damn.
No. Not even any store like that
I agree with you.

Governments are not pro-active, they are reactive, especially in oligarchal models. What caused people to isolate was the massive fearmongering by the media. The same news stations played the same videos the same photos over and over again. People began responsing not with \*reason\* but with their fear, meaning they began acting irrationally which was reflected in the confusion the government than produced. ie military helicopters flying over forests

&#x200B;

The elites realized that weve had decades of attacks against REASON itself, attempting to get rid of it, making the population extremely vulnerable to out of control passions. This all manifested itself in the mass hysteria lockdowns.

If even a slight majority of the population knew how to think, and knew how to apply that reason to reality ie pratical morality we would't have a mass hysteria event.

12 months before the pandemic people were talking about 1 thousand genders existing and men marrying men. This was the IDEAL conditions where hysteria could take root and flourish.

&#x200B;

During the previous pandemic some 10-15 years ago you had the same group attempt a mass vaccination event but it petered out because you still had some REASON left in the population.
The only action you can do now is demand the government 'wall off' Wallstreet. That is impose regulations that seperate gambling from actual economic development. This would mean deflating the prices of nominal assets of virtual rich people while simultaneously inflating the real economy via wages and major infrastructure projects.

You need to create a type of playpen where the sociopaths can go and screw each other over \*without\* affecting the real economy. Let Buffet, Gates, Soros etc all sit and bet against each other \*walled\* off from the rest of us.

Let them use their own private bank to finance the bets, not the commercial banking network of the nation. This means a dramatic reduction in margin lending, mortgage lending, derivatives etc.

Do you see any political party that even understands this dynamic? The leftist ideologues demand higher \*nominal\* wages and the corporate elites are FINE with that because it doesnt matter if I give you $10 or $100 per hour if I can raise your mortgage payment, rent, insurances, bills. I \*get\* all the money anyway.

The second thing that needs to happen is impose mandatory LIFE/ death penalty sentences for CEOs of banks that actively assist in laundering drug money. That would stop the drug trade in a second.

The third thing you need to happen is a total rehaul of the utterly lowgrade educational system that exists.
God is always interested.
jeSuS taKe thE WHeeL
It sure seems like it should have increased more than that by a lot, I wonder if wages would be more commensurate with your skill level if you were someplace with a big medical center like Houston
>What caused people to isolate was the massive fearmongering by the media.

It wasn't fear mongering though and fear is not always irrational. This virus wasn't bullshit, 30% of those infected with symptoms had symptoms long after they got better. The virus can cause permanent damage to the heart and lungs. And of course people died, young healthy people too. Then you have the whole fiscal aspect, who wants to get infected and potentially spend days or weeks in a hospital? I know I'd rather have that money than give it to a hospital. 

It's all risk assessment for the individual that drove this behavior, and there is logical and rational reasoning to support that behavior, even if it is fear induced. But my main point in responding to you was to simply say that even if government did nothing, sectors of the economy would've suffered greatly from this change of behavior. The lockdowns were a formality, and states that did not lockdown that ended up having outbreaks caused people regardless of beliefs and ideology to react accordingly in their own self interest, except for the outliers.
“Military helicopters flying over forests”

What does this mean? Is this a common phrase? Or something that happened? Eli5
https://youtu.be/-UZDRfmYibg
That would probably help.  We have two local hospitals.  One is a rural smaller complex and the other is a regional medical center.  The regional medical center is about to be purchased by some company because they cannot keep the place staffed.  More than 60 percent of their nurses are contractors/ travel nurses.  The other smaller hospital has a terrible reputation in the community and only poor people or dire emergency patients will go there if given any choice.  No,  that's not sour grapes on my part,  I have never worked there and yes, it's pretty bad.
They took photos from Italy and were broadcasting sensational imagery completely taken out of context. North Italy was in winter and had the following realities. A collapsed healthcare system due to 2 decades of austerity, heavy smog, an extremely aged population and a high chinese population from wuhan due to business ties.

The Italian government needed this crisis in order to get a massive boost of emergency spending, some 330bil USD worth to prop up what was a collapsing economy.

According to a march 2021 Italian government report the median death age is 86 for females and 81 for males with the majority having at least 3 major health issues of which heart disease accounted for 30%.

Neil Ferguson an empericist wrote up a highly flawed computer model which pushed the west over the edge and into full blown lockdowns. UK scientists are on record admitting their massive fearmongering led to a totalitarian state. The entire concept of 'lockdown' came from UK elites who have a feudal mentality and view the population as a 'herd'. They started using terminology from husbandry ie 'herd immunity', 'social distancing' etc.

The elites are on record in complete shock that the population tolerated such dramatic pseudo-scientific totalitarianism.

The general public has been demoralized for decades now, they are unable to form their own opinions on any subject. They began panicking which spread to the authorities(who are just as ignorant as the population). Scientism has repalced science as the decision making process.

If you told people that marrying animals would be OK, they would accept it at this point. This is the mind of slavery, unable to grasp truths.

Pseudo-scientists responsible for killing people in the AIDS over-reaction like Fauci suddenly showed up like cartoon characters.

You had arrogant billionaires like bill gates making public health statements.

Those clever enough, namely the financial oligarchy saw an opportunity to offload bad investments and monopolize the situation.
The government decided it was a pandemic based on arbitrary statistics and health systems had trouble from decades of austerity.  


I agree with you that many people would have stopped going out anyway just like they do during a bad flu season.  


However in this case you had a special group of people becoming extremely wealthy in the hysteria that makes it all the more suspect.
I totally believe you. One of the main hospitals we have here in Houston for poor people is Ben Taub, but this is the largest medical center in the world, with lots of resources, and Ben Taub is a teaching hospital so top-tier residents are working on the poor people while they are being supervised, so you have extra sets of eyes on each patient, a good place to land if you’re poor and sick! I am happy for your community that they have someone like you there to help take care of them, smaller communities and smaller hospitals are going to feel much more impact from a nurse like you and it must feel good to help so many people. But if you ever get sick of it, come to Houston!
You have constructed a false narrative in your own head. It is painfully obvious you are susceptible to conspiratorial thinking and most assuredly lack genuine (real world) perspective. I will share my experience. My wife gave birth to our first (probably only) child last May. We live 100""s of miles from our families so found ourselves as caregivers having to completely isolate to protect our son. Covid affects different people in different ways. Being unable to care for our son with no support due to ill health would have been an absolute disaster. So that is our personal risk profile. Add in all the other young families in a similar position or those who wished to protect their elderly loved ones or just plain have the presence of mind to understand overwhelmed health systems collapse no matter how much money you throw at them and you are quickly in the millions of people acting responsibly to protect themselves, their families and society at large.
Look man, I'm not trying to get in to this with you. I just wanted to point out, based on objective data, how people reacted all on their own, and that would've caused great harm anyway to the economy and various sectors. That's all. :) Peace!

Italy is a shitty country  everywhere the gov spends money, there are people that know how to be inefficient and steal some of it. Since everyone steals at any level where he can, you have the highest level of inefficiency you can imagine.

This doesn't impact quality of service because we have infinite money anyway, which means debt over debt... And more debt. Actually more debt that that. Everyone knows there's no way we're paying it back, the interests only are now like 1/6 of the total tax revenue it has become ridiculous.

Yes, I'm italian. Hope I can get out of this shithole soon, before they start seizing money from people's bank accounts (italy is a ""welfare state"" which is a form of corrupt socialism, they can do a law overnight to take 1% from every bank account and you can't do anything about it)
>However in this case you had a special group of people becoming extremely wealthy in the hysteria that makes it all the more suspect.

Why is it suspect? It's easier to make money once you have a significant amount. IE the return on $100 investment vs $10,000 vs %1,000,000. The large the amount the more likely you suffer less losses and larger gains.

Don't get me wrong, the game is rigged this way in the same sense that the casino always wins. Those with all the money make the rules so they have an advantage in the system. But that is ultimately why those with hundreds of millions of dollars typically made a lot of money during the pandemic. That and their access to inside information and expertise.
That's very kind of you to say.  I really enjoy my work and I like to believe that I am making a very positive difference in peoples lives without regard to their bank accounts.  It's getting more and more difficult for young people to live in this area.  Maybe because it's so rural.  Maybe because of the economy as a whole.  The day is fast approaching that I may have nothing left to tie my to this community. If I decide to move,  I will almost certainly move a lot Hahaha.  Houston is one of the areas that I would definitely consider.  On the other hand,  I have a brother in Colorado Springs.  It's a tough decision and I won't know until the time comes.  Notwithstanding,  I plan on taking excellent care of my patients wherever I am.
Underfunded and already previously overloaded health systems  were killing people with ventilators early on because the doctors were behaving irrationally due to the atmosphere created by the mass media.

People were also unecessarily rushing to hospitals due to the \*perception\* of immediate death.
They never 'reacted on their own'. They reacted to a particular narrative that was blasted on the medium they watch or listen too 24/7. This narrative was entirely based on SENSE impressions designed to trigger mass hysteria. Which it did.

The question is \*why\* did they react in that way when exposed to sense impressions. The answer I am giving you is over the last few decades the populations cognitive ability to use reason \*over\* passions has been dramatically reduced.

A cartoon like reality show ensued with so called 'scientists' who look the part being brought in as 'experts' to continue scaring the public.

Had this occured even 20 years ago there would never have been lockdowns.

The government is not pro-active, it does \*not\* set policy, it reacts to narratives set by what we call the 'free market', in this case the corporate media.

Your objective data shows that the coronavirus was largely irrelevant?

People react to a narrative spoon fed to them, not 'on their own'. The only reason someone knows of a covid outbreak is because of a narrow media story.

For example, it is now known fact that covid was most likely in Italy as early as September 2019. Yet the panic \*narrative\* began 5 months later by the corporate owned media, with government reaction coming in a full 6-7 months later. 

People know about the flu every year and rarely do they take precautions \*even in an outbreak area\*. However if I started streaming SENSE IMPRESSIONS of dead people 24/7, they would react to it.
This isnt the first time a pandemic hysteria was attempted. 60 minutes even covers the 70's swine flu fraud. About 10 years ago during h1n1 I believe they tried the same thing, this time they were able to get away with it because of how demoralized the population is.  


The fact is the economy especially the financial system was wobbling already in 2019, they needed a narrative and created one. If the media barely covered this youd think it was just a flu season. The deaths are overstated because of the reactions by governments, many especially in the EU froze their state run health systems which caused procedures to be pushed forward leading to deaths.
It is clear you are impervious to reason. Best of luck.
>**If the media barely covered this youd think it was just a flu season.** The deaths are overstated because of the reactions by governments, many especially in the EU froze their state run health systems which caused procedures to be pushed forward leading to deaths.

* https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid

Go ahead and take a look at the US and Sweden for an idea of countries that didn't ""shut down their health systems"". Not that I really believe that is an accurate description of what Europe may have done.

Even my crank liberal friend who was against shutdowns, skeptical of masks, distrustful of the CDC, etc... trusted the YoY mortality data to really see how this virus was effecting us. Definitely NOT a flu season. I also know people who took 3-6 months to fully recover, so not just a regular cold or flu for those people. And my brother was intubated twice. So yeah... definitely not what you are saying here.
I think its you who are impervious. These entire scam has been tried before in the 70's and mid 2000's with H1N1 where they tried to vaccinate everyone.

Yellen says U.S. aims to move ahead with global minimum corporate tax,1688.0,https://www.reuters.com/business/yellen-says-us-aims-move-ahead-with-global-minimum-corporate-tax-despite-setback-2022-07-16/,"Her and what Congress?
And leave giant loopholes so they can get around it…
As we get older as a Country, its painfully obvious everything in DC is broke, inept and corrupt and led by clowns
Amazing how economists suddenly forget economics when they get political appointments
God she is so dumb….
A VAT is an awful idea. The greed of the government will ensure you are getting a VAT while keeping the current income tax system. You will only end up driving prices higher. 

The dirty little secret is that corporations don’t pay tax. Corporations collect taxes on behalf of the government. I would support a national sales tax as a way to collect income if, and only if, they revoked the current tax regime.
She said the United States had a strong incentive to move forward because as other countries enacted the tax agreement, they would be taxing the foreign profits of U.S. companies, while the United States would be leaving ""that tax revenue on the table rather than capturing it ourselves.""

Things like this are going to make corporations abandon the left and go back to supporting right wing groups.
Good. Lots of weirdos making up stuff in this comment section with no basis in reality.
I’d rather companies retain their earnings rather than give it to the government to waste it on stupid shit like predator drones
When they control the flow of money, they control your life. Alternate trade will soon step up as the dark currency.
I am waiting to hear from Janet Yellen, who is a much better federal reserve chair than treasury secretary in my opinion, make a justification for the global 15% tax that makes sense for her home country, America. I am not happy with her insisting it become a reality without understanding why it is so darn important.
This is stupid. Let countries choose their own tax rates.
We need less taxes and less regulations. Yellen was wrong about inflation and should be fired.
Yes everyone knows that more tax will lower prices./s
And another step toward OWO.  

Not oral without.  I mean One World Order.
Yellen is a fucking retarded tool. This is not good for the US at all and is just a way to try and screw businesses over. Democrats need to stand in front of trains and spare the rest from having to live in society with their stupidity.
To put it simply: this is dumb
Imagine I’d the National Association of Realtors announced they were pursuing a minimum commission requirement.  Nobody could sell for a lower commission. Who would that benefit? The consumer or the realtor?
Here comes the great consolidation after small business is stomped out.
Why don't we have a global tax on oil despots?  Or dictators?  Or politicians?
Actually we do not need government. We should completely abolish this Benidorm bastards.
The thin end of the One World Government you will own nothing and eat zee bugz. Und be huppy.
…but they’re not though. Republicans have been against it from the start, and democrats new tax plan would make us unable to agree to the deal. It doesn’t matter what people say, it matters what they actually try to do

Probably for the best though, I think the deal is a horrible idea
Corporations just raise prices to pay for taxes so cheer all you want you will still be the one that pays
We’re going to have more red states and conservative politicians over the next 10 years because of stuff like this.
Stupid
Yellen is estimated to be worth $20M in 2021.  This comes from big money controlling the government for control and profit.  This is exactly why so many assets are controlled by so few.
About goddam time
Is anyone afraid that all the big corporations will just privatize as partnerships and raise money a different way?
The US federal government has no power without the US corporations. America is built on corporations, no surprise the gov is trying to make life easier for the corp.
She looks cool. “No capes!”
Manchin and the rest of the GOP are just amazingly terrible people.
We need a VAT TAX.
FLAT TAX FOR EVERYONE or FOH
except for this applying to areas like the city of london who have their own exemptions
Makes no sense; even if every nation in the world completely and unequivocally agreed upon an international corporate tax with no legal loopholes, any nation could apply tax credits and such to make the effective tax rate zero.
I bet. Then they can go and use that money to do things like build roads next to land they own. Or they will use it to enrich their friends more. Very little if it will go to the places it should suck as social programs to support those who need it.
From what little I know on this subject, the United States may break even on this proposition. We will lose major amounts of tax of our many foreign companies that we are currently taxing and will gain back some of the tax of the foreign companies that sell work here. But barely, breakeven… WTF
Great. Add people as well. Everyone should pay taxes, even if a nominal amount.
This was a plank in my presidential bid platform, but nobody supported those monies being applied to water, food, housing and healthcare.
Stupid idea.  Welcome to the one world order.  This woman soon be tranquilized.
If they do business in the US, they have to pay.
Global minimum corporate tax means? Is USA gonna force other country's to have a minimum tax rate as well?
Finally, or until then loopholes are fully exhausted.  Also I can hear corporations yelling “this will stunt our million-dollar-profit company’s growth!”  And I see politicians using that as justification to reject the tax.
sayin US is instituting a global tax is. laughable. as they don't have the level of influence to institute global protocols.
imagine being so American u think US policy makers can make real global decisions lol
Good luck when you don’t even have Dems on board
How do you enforce that? Your just going to tell the Cayman Islands what to do? Good luck
Jesus! Is this dumb lady trying to force recession? They raise taxes on companies it will raise prices even higher then they are going now, who can pay for it! And how do we expect the companies to keep hiring people?
Does she know what inflation is? Or is she just another geriatric who needs to be put in a home?
30% or more please. Make them pay the military budget since it is primarily for them and their lust for all things capitalism.
Came to say this.

Congress reading this like: “She doesn’t even go here!”
It’ll be like the League of Nations where the US sort of sets everything up on a global scale and then Congress votes not to join the global program we spearheaded
All of them I guess
doesnt matter, misleading title, the us cant enact global proticols or stipulations because. duh, the US isnt the whole earth xD last i checks thats what global meant xD national maybe but. not global.
Yeah we could instead sanction companies that don't pay it. If we were serious and all.
Yep, all bullshit measures intended to keep moderates happy.

Yelen is a joke though. Hyped up and turns out she's just a corporate slackey just like the rest of them.
how else would she keep getting speaking fees?
I think you mean freedom lassos
I think there’s just so much more exposure now days compared to the past. It’s more than likely always been this way. Never the less, extremely frustrating and disappointing.
They knew it from day 1, that's why they created the constitution to try and greatly limit the power in Washington DC.
It's definitely not *uniformly* corrupt. Fostering a sense of despair in the electorate is the best weapon the corrupt have in fighting efforts to reform.

There have been numerous waves of reform in our history from both of the major parties and involving both inexperienced politicians and involving incumbents. However the last significant wave of reform minded voter sentiment was completely hijacked by lobbyists, and turned into the tea party anti-establishment movement which installed officials more corrupt than their predecessors with corruption superpower of being able to claim that their norm-breaking was a virtue.
It is becoming very clear that DC is a fucking circus. Need to clean the sheet, get new blood in.

And by new blood, not AOC ""throw a third of GDP at dumbshit green energy crap"", not QAnon/""get rid of the fed reserve"", like find some fucking normal people ffs.

The latest RvW means the Supreme Court is now corruptible, hurray. And our central bank can't tell its own head from its own ass.

And seriously, why is Ted Cruz still around?

Fucking clowns, all of them
I think it kinda always has been, more or less.  Perils of democracy, but idk how you get a government that will defend individual liberties without being elected by the individuals.
Always has been.
I’m starting to feel like
I should be in the club instead of trying to change it
These are glorified politicians masquerading as economists.
A national sales tax impacts poor people more than rich people. 

The progressive income tax we have now is better it just needs a higher cap and to redefine what is and isn't income so rich people can't just take loans against their assets and avoid paying tax forever.
The ""libertarians spout half assed psuedo-economics"" subs are over there
Not sure I follow… this isn’t a VAT tax.
Corporations do not support political ideologies, only their corporate interests. It might appear that a corporation supports the left, but only if ""the left"" is buying more of their products. I like the thought though.
It becomes increasingly clear that Yellen doesn’t understand the deal at all. Not only does the US already have a minimum tax on global income, but this new deal likely loses us tax revenue, not gains it
They will support whoever allows them to keep not paying their bills
[deleted]
Clearly, appeasing  corporations is our top priority. Not curbing inflation or helping people.
Why do you think it’s good that we move forward with the deal?
Predator drones are cool af tho
They did choose.... the US isn't enforcing this internationally, they reached a deal with other countries.....
Dumbest take on this sub, congratulations toddler.
Then we should stop defending the tax dodgers.
Not only her. How about the Fed? the sole job of a Fed is inflation and they missed it terribly. Not sure if they understood it but made a wrong statements (its transitory) just for public consumption or if they didn't understand it, which is worse.  Politicians getting it wrong is understandable.
Man, his sub realy is just ""right wingers pretend to know about economics and make up nonsense to attack people with""
[deleted]
I’m hoping this is sarcasm. I only say that because there are folks on this sub who would legitimately argue that point of view.
Unironically it can. Especially during times of steep inflation.
So, explain your position on Yellen
Uh....... do you think small businesses are paying large sums in corporate tax?

It has always bugged me how the right always tries to say that taxes kill small business when they don't really have that much of an effect. Especially compared to how corporations can bully and buyout supply chain to their competitors basically unchecked because republicans have gutted consumer protections.
Or stupid comments? That will bring in a lot of revenue
What kind of weird political Facebook memes have you been looking at?
This is not and has never been true. In fact, one of the most reliable ways to curb inflation is taxing the wealthy.
Why?
Doubt it, investors need a way to exit and have limited liability
We should all just have a tiny portion of our paycheck automatically go directly to Fortune 500 corporations so they don’t have a temper tantrum and collapse the global economy. We’ll call it when the Stockholm Syndrome fee.
The US already has a global minimum tax
America became a corporatocracy in the 1960s when the military industrial complex gained power.  It created innovation at the expense of freedoms.
Why?
What are you talking about? Wall Street wants this to create the illusion that they’ll end up footing the bill, but they won’t.
They already do
It’ll probably end up losing the US tax revenue, which isn’t great.
or when we changed the caliber of all of NATO's guns in the most inconvenient way possible
Or it could work like the Paris Accords, where the president just signs an agreement that has no enforcement mechanism.
This sounds like the beginning of a Ronny Chieng bit
The league of nations worked out great!
To be fair, the US already has a global tax for companies, so we kinda already do “sanction” the ones that don’t pay it
The problem is if we sanction them and no j on me else does they will move to tax havens. Off shoring gas decimated the US. It will soon decimate china when their labor costs rose as quality of living rises. India, Vietnamese, Nepal will be the new china and they will get to experience jobs being removed
Or, you know, fix your tax system to begin with...
Go to r/politics if you're going to whinge aimlessly
Do you have any info on the background of the global minimum tax? This isn’t something Yellen came up with. This is something the US is implementing because of the OECD BEPS 2.0 initiative.
Thats a good point.
Have you actually read the decision?  What exactly did you disagree with. They bent over backward to tell congress to make a law already and quit relying on the court to do their dirty work.
I concur however the Govt has gotten too big and the agencies are too far gone. There is no going back. Electing new people won’t help. Term limits may help, eliminating 90% of agency/bureacracy head count may help..
So then is California the most regressive state in the country and Florida etc not?

California sales tax is 7.25-10% (9.5% in LA and 8.85% in nyc).

While Republican states have cheaper sales tax (7% in Miami 8.25% Austin 

The red states also generally don’t have an income tax and have higher property tax which tends to impact wealthy people more.
Exclude foodstuffs and problem solved.

To your point, I would treat all income as income. Tax everything at the ordinary income rate with no lower rates for dividends or long term capital gains.
Wrong, a retail sales tax is the opposite of ""regressive"".

Higher incomes always have more discretionary spending. 

The poor, and middle class are now taxed on 100% of earned income which they then use the post tax leftovers to pay for living, and medical expenses. 

Under sales tax unless you tax RENT the poor, and lower middle class will be paying MUCH less taxes.

Even better what taxes you pay are immediately obvious,  and you don't need to hire a tax expert at the end of the year to find out what you paid.

This eliminates the divide between the rich who live on Capitol gains, and working class that punch a time clock, and pay nearly double the rate on earned income.
Definitely not a libertarian. Worked for a really rich one once upon a time. I’m a free market economist by orientation.
I just put in a paragraph break. Thanks for pointing that out!
It's working as designed.
My exact quote was, ""eat the rich"", but the media always gets it wrong.
This would replace BEAT so I don’t see the problem. Why do you think this would decrease US tax revenues?
Start Googling board of directors of your favorite company, then members of Congress. 

It's the same picture.
Because its a step toward eliminating tax loopholes.
Why is that a bad take? Global minimum rates just transfer tax revenue from poorer countries to richer countries. This agreement is very much a bad thing that would hurt developing countries and the US
Who’s defending the tax dodgers?
💯💯
Look at Irelands GDP compared to Germany, less taxes and regulations work. One of the reasons for the oil crisis is because of regulations stopping production & refinement.
Of course sarcasm. Doesn't make sense any other way! 

Edit-Thanks for the award
lol
Doing what she is doing is literally targeting business and setting up the US for catastrophe. All it takes is one country to break it and offer low corporate taxation and the flood of jobs leaving will be very real. When you increase taxation you decrease profit and in turn you decrease R&D as well as decrease new product investment. This has been tried numerous times and has been a catastrophic failure every time. Just like everything else with the left it’s “well it will be different this time! We have this person that has the claim it will be different and so it will be!”. In the end it won’t be and you are just hurting your own economy. It is incredibly intelligent during a recession too, must be part of the Biden “Build …. Back ……. Uh what was that word again” Plan. More destruction brought to you by your friendly government dictator Democrats.

Ahhh,  but you have heard of me. 😆
>one of the most reliable ways to curb inflation is taxing the wealthy

There isn’t really true, and especially not true for corporations. Wealthy people have a very low marginal propensity to consume, so higher taxes won’t really reduce the demand for most goods
I'm specifically talking about corporate taxes.
It will result in less companies ending up paying little to no taxes on their profits
Partnership units and a nominally-capitalized GP corp
Well millions of people will suffer and die without the current economic infrastructure so I don’t think it’s very funny
That's basically already happened with the inflation from quantitative easing but I don't think the economists that are funded by the US chamber of commerce will interrupt their jawboning to mention that. They'll just tell you some bullshit about consumer surplus and reserve price to try to convince you that you somehow saved money
Ya well if you’ve seen how military contracts are structured you’d know there is no intensive for innovation. Innovation being defined as making things more advanced and cost efficient, it’s one of the reasons why the American military is pricy.
Because they actively subvert any positive change?
Socialist governments want this so countries like Ireland can’t do too well attracting new business and growing their economy.  It’s also why their is a mass exodus from California and New York to Florida and Texas.
>that they’ll end up footing the bill, but they won’t 

Who will?
But in this case the US doesn't really have any strong incentives not to follow up on the deal. While I wholehartedly think the US should follow up on the Paris Accords and hope they will do so now after Biden has rejoined it, I also acknowledge that there were several economic reasons not to follow them. A global minimum corporate tax rate doesn't really have the same negatives for the US, which already has an above average corporate tax rate.
The whole global minimum tax came about as part of the OECD’s BEPS 2.0 initiative. This wasn’t the US’s idea, they’re just going along with the BEPS plan.
If they move, take their shit. Sorry did you want your billions in assetsback and access to every global market that accepted the tax? Then play by our rules.

The problem started when countries started pussyfooting around companies instead of showing them they exist at the behest of the people, to serve society. If they stop doing that, we take their toys away with guns. Not arbitrarily, predictably with the rule of law.
The problem is if we sanction them and no one else does they will move to tax havens. Off shoring jobs decimated the US. It will soon decimate china when their labor costs rose as quality of living rises. India, Vietnamese, Nepal will be the new china and they will get to experience jobs being removed
This cancer has been here throughout human history. There have been no great leaders or civilizations. All were built on human suffering at the bottom, and gluttony at the top. We just have 100% proof now due to the internet and it’s causing a lot of stress, anxiety, mental health issues, addiction issues, suicide, shootings etc. Remember those movies about crazy conspiracy theorists (I think there was one with Mel Gibson actually called Conspiracy)? Yeah, now the majority of citizens are like this. Shitty public servants ( I will no longer call them leaders or rulers, they should be referred to as servants), have screwed everyone up.
You'll hear this about everything it's such a good point.
Thank God (and the Founding Fathers) for term limits, otherwise we'd be stuck with some of these shitbags for some time.

No worries though, it wouldn't be an overnight fix, but I think if we gradually inject some sanity back into DC (and where it doesn't interfere with everyone else's business), we can get that train back on track. The loud minorities (left and right) took the helm and nearly crashed the ship, but we can take it back on the right course.

Again, thanks to that beautiful Constitution and those beautiful term limits. That's why I love this country.

Have a great weekend!
Yes.  Sales tax is inherently regressive, therefore California and New York have more regressive tax policies than Florida when it comes to sales tax.

>The red states also generally don’t have an income tax and have higher property tax which tends to impact wealthy people more.

Well, that depends on what you mean by ""impacts more"".  Wealthier people would pay a higher total amount than a poor person, however, it would be a lower percentage of the wealthy person's overall income.  This means that unless the property tax is progressive with respect to total income, it's still a regressive tax scheme that places a higher burden on lower-income residents.
Illinois we have one of the highest income tax rates, highest property taxes and some places have sales tax over 10%.
Right, food is the only thing poor people spend money on...?
A retail sales tax is the definition of regressive.  As in, if you Google ""regressive tax example"", a sales tax is literally the first thing that pops up.  

https://imgur.com/a/xm9Jz4F

This absolutely does nothing to eliminate any divide between rich and poor, and only exacerbates it.  You are literally arguing that up is down here...

And if you're not capable of changing your opinion upon receiving new information, then there's no point in continuing this conversation because you are flat out wrong on all counts here.
Don't care what you call yourself. If you want o play pretend with fake economics, go over there.
I still don’t understand why you’re concerned about a VAT tax regime. There is no proposal to have one in the US. The global minimum tax is not VAT. Am I missing something?
Pillar 2 would replace BEAT/GILTI, but with more relaxed rules. The more countries that adopt the 15% minimum, the more foreign tax credits US companies can use to offset their US liability. They’ll also be able to carry the excess forward, which they can’t currently do

Pillar 1 changes the formula for multinational apportionment by placing a larger percentage on the residency of the end buyer. It’s supposed to end up shifting revenue from countries where a lot of production and payroll occur (like the US) towards countries that buy those goods
Do you actually think the United States chamber of commerce is with the left?
The US already has a global minimum tax, which is why this deal likely would lose us revenue. There’s no “tax loophole” that this agreement is intended to solve for us
1. It’s a childish understanding of how political economy works, as if countries set their rate in a vacuum, either made in bad faith or pure stupidity á la libertarians. They are a result of a complex set of interactions between domestic stakeholders, external pressure by creditors, capital interests and transnational corporations and the balance of power between them, along with the need for accumulating dollar-denominated FX to stabilize the value of the currency, as long as the country in question partakes in dollar hegemony, which entails a constant pressure for investor-friendly measures vis-a-vis other countries. This deal sets a floor on that (on paper), in terms of one narrow policy; corporate income taxes.

2. No one’s forcing them to sign this deal; they are setting the rates they wish if they sign it.

3. No one’s stopping them from setting the rates higher if they so wish.

4. Your comment has nothing to do *at all* with this deal; how taxes are calculated and collected, e.g., based on sales made in the country, is entirely different from what the rate is, and isn’t homogenous.
It transfers money from the global private sector to public sector by abolishing tax haven states. This would keep companies in the US while making it easier for most  countries to inflict tax bills
The US military implicitly and explicitly ‘supports’ a number of nations with low/well below average corporate tax rates. 

There is a strong argument that tax havens, even democratic ones, are a drag on democratic functions in other larger non tax haven democracies.
Yes, it is true. Please, im not going through this song and dance where you don't actually know what you are talking about and raise vague objections. Your logic is flimsy at best and not grounded in any actual academic works.
Who do you think corporate profits go to?
Are you sure this deal is a positive change?
The U.S. isn’t a socialist country. The U.S. has a mixed economy, exhibiting characteristics of both capitalism and socialism. Such a mixed economy embraces the free market when it comes to capital use, but it also allows for government intervention for the public good.
Taxpayers, duh.
I disagree, there’s a huge incentive for the US not to follow through with this. It probably loses us tax revenue, and we’d have to raise our own minimum tax to match the 15%
Yeah that’s not why companies exists. Your statement is delusional everywhere except Russia and china. You are discussing state owned not private property of companies.
I mean, I wouldn't say they actively screwed everyone up - it's more like society is collectively reeling at the information spotlight being placed on our warts - they were always there but yeugh we don't like looking straight at them.

We're going to get them removed but it requires toughening up, putting a plan in place, and executing on it. And at the scale of a nation, it will take many years. 
We have to buckle up and get going though. You don't get to fix it by complaining alone.
Lol more like self servants
there have been admirable attempts, specifically those who pushed the transition from monarchies to democracies. No leader or civilization have been perfect but is there a different time period you would rather live where you think you would be afforded more rights or freedoms?
Ummmm, the only federal office with a term limit is POTUS, and that was added in the 20th century.
Well articulated…right on. Never give up.
Losers give up.
It’s always the people who proclaim to love the Constitution the most who seem to know the least on what’s actually in it.
Not really because most people wealth is actually tied up in their home/real estate and in general the home they can afford is proportional to their salary.

So would you agree then that blue states are actually more regressive than red states in their taxes? If so why don’t we here more about that in your complaints about a national sales tax.

To me it would be fair to have a national sales tax and then require the blue states if they want to be less regressive to reduce their sales tax.
It’s a blue state so no one cares
And rent, and medical bills.
They have a higher propensity to consume than rich people, that generally means basic survival items (food, toilet paper). I used to work for a top-10 richest person in the US. He had a fleet of jets and lets say he didn’t drive a Corolla. When he buys another Maybach, he’ll pay 17% (or whatever the number is) on $200k versus 17% on a $22k car.

I’m also ok with a flat tax, although it’s open to arguments that it’s regressive
Oh, yeah if Google says it, then that's it.

Up is down. 

I used to live in one of those ""progressive"" income tax States.

I paid way more income taxes at $30k a year in that State than when I moved to a sales tax State. 

So you can regressive as much as you like, but you, and every other Marxist that loves forcing every lawn mower, waitress, and hair dresser to give a full financial disclosure to the Federal government, and taxing every dime earned can go to hell.
Yeah, that’s not how that works.  And FWIW, they points are just as valid as any. If you want to argue “what should be” then you aren’t an economist anymore, you’re a lobbyist. Bugger off and bother someone else.
VAT is the competing methodology to a global minimum. A number of countries already have a VAT so it’s probably easier to implement one broadly than convince countries like Ireland to go to a global minimum. FWIW, I think a global minimum is a bad idea, also.
Gotcha, I haven’t actually looked at how much tax revenue is generated from BEAT. I have very few clients that actually pay it though. 

One thing that seems to be overlooked with the global min tax is that state and local income taxes (and some franchise taxes) can also offset it - not just foreign taxes.
When you're a conspiracy theorist, everyone is against you
...... no. Im sorry, just no. If you ae going to make things up on the spot, at least make them good lies.
All that text, and you didn’t really answer the question on why it’s bad for countries to choose their own tax rates

>no one’s forcing them to sign this deal

Um yeah, they pretty much are, even if it’s indirectly. Countries with rates below 15% (or even above 15%) would stand to lose tax revenue by signing onto the agreement, but would stand to lose even more tax revenue by not agreeing to it. You’re pretty much forcing their hand

>No one’s stopping them from setting their rates  higher

Of course not, but that’s not the issue. There would be no real reason to set the foreign rate above 15%, the need of those countries is to set it below 15%, which this deal wouldn’t allow

>based on sales made in the country

You’re referring to pillar 1 of the deal and completely ignoring pillar 2. While pillar 1 reallocates taxing rights more towards the residency of buyer, pillar 2 sets up the global minimum 15% through the UTPR and IIR, which was what my comment refers to, and the part that hurts developing countries

Question for you: if a US company, for example, has an effective tax rate of 15% **solely** on its US income, why should foreign countries be able to apply top-up taxes on that US income?
There’d actually be a good incentive not to organize in the US if this were to pass. Overall, countries that currently rely on foreign investment would lose out, while richer, more developed countries (except the US) would see more tax revenue
Why would you assume that raising taxes on the wealthy would lower inflation? Raising taxes on people who spend most of their income certainly would, but again, this isn’t the wealthy
This doesn’t change the fact that corporations pass off the tax bill onto the consumer. You are trying to move this into a completely different subject. Lol
You are sure it isn’t?
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland

Government intervention is almost never good.  After the Great Recession, Ireland changed their system.  Lowered corporate tax rates to 12% and vastly reduced government intervention.  As a result they have become the gold standard compared to other EU nations.  All government does is to stunt economic development with onerous regulations and red tape.  Big government is the greatest threat to global financial security of sovereign people.
Corporations are taxpayers
????
US corporate tax rate is already higher than 15%.

How does it lose US tax revenue? If anything it mlght be a benefit because companies won't have as strong a reason to move from the US to a foreign tax haven.
Companies exist for the benefit of, and at the behest of, society at large.even in private, capitalist markets. That is just a different argument as to what produces the best for society,read Adam Smith. 

That can change I'd companies fuck up too much.
You are incredibly optimistic. The elite are never going to give up the power they wield willingly and the people don’t exactly seem ready for revolution. I do expect to see a civil war in our lifetime here in the US but I don’t know that anything will change.
Yep, thanks for pointing that out
Yes, that is true for most people, but those tax systems don't account for the super-rich and wealthy, which is a progressive tax system is so important.  Otherwise a property tax based system is just a give-away to anyone rich enough that most of their money isn't tied up in their house.

I agree that sales tax is inherently regressive.  However, whether a 9% sales tax in a blue state or a flat tax on property in a red state is more regressive would depend on the totality of the distribution of the tax burden in those states.  

There's a very important distinction to make here between what ""sounds fair"", i.e. everyone plays the same flat %, and what ""is fair"", i.e. everyone pays an amount such that the burden of tax is evenly distributed upon the populace.

Wealthy people and corporations love to push the ""sounds fair"" methodology because they don't think people are smart enough to understand basic math.  Don't fall for it.
The ones who care are packing up and leaving.  Good for them.
It's not open to arguments. It IS regressive.

You got a very skewed pov here my friend.
1.  Not a marxist.  

2.  You moved from a high tax state to a low tax state.  The total amount you paid in tax says nothing about the specifics of a state's tax policy.

3.  For a financial sub, you seem to be pretty bad at basic math.
Your brain has completely rotted man. You need to self-examine.
""If you talk about policy then its not economics""

Thank you for once again confirm that you are playing pretend and not basing anything you say in reality.
Countries with a VAT would still have the proposed global min tax (which is an income tax) just like they currently have both a VAT and corporate income tax.
Not really a conspiracy.... How is it a conspiracy? 

They are openly the largest lobbying group in America, funded by corporations, and overwhelmingly endorse right wing politicians. I don't think the US chamber of commerce represents the interests of US labour and consumers and in no way is on the side of the 'left'.
Be my guest: which US loophole would this deal solve?

>make things up on the spot

Feel free to tell me which part is made up. Unlike you, I can actually back up my claims
Its not an assumption, its well grounded and evidence based economics. Again, you are making things up as you go, its not worth trying to debate the nuance when you throw it out the window and invent new things to say on the spot.
Again, this is has always been false. Repeating the same lie over and over doesn't make it true. Im jot changing the subject at all. 

I don't think this will be productive. You are already deploying dishonest tactics like accusing me of changing the subject when I've been talking about the same thing the whole time.
I’m under the impression it’s bad
It’s not just about the domestic tax rate, countries have to set a minimum tax rate on foreign income. Right now, the US is the only country that has one, but that rate is often below 15%

Since we already get revenue from that tax though, the new agreement doesn’t really bring us extra revenue. But with more countries adopting a 15% rate, the US gets more foreign tax credits to use to offset their US tax

Pillar 1 of the deal is also set up to shift taxing rights away from the US and towards the countries where the goods are sold
You found 1 person to agree I don’t feel it is worth my time for a lesson in capitalism and the govt seizing private citizens investments as a bad idea and the fastest way to grind an economy and investments to a halt. 

I can find many differing opinions on any topic. I appreciate your response with a source I however will disagree with him and you in the matter and I am comfortable knowing that many agree with me as may agree with you.
The reverse is incredibly pessimistic - as if the society of today is even remotely as bad as it was even 100 years ago.

I think it's very realistic to expect things to continue improving, even if that improvement does not come freely or easily - hence, why i said, we have to buckle up and get going on fighting for it, and not giving up just becuase it's not perfect *now*. It will never be perfect - we must always fight to maintain it, even when progress is achieved.
Most poor people don’t own homes or pay income taxes. So if you pay tax in a red state your tax burden is less then a red state.

Super Wealthy people don’t get taxed on income only capital gains.

I just point it out because democrats talk about all this stuff but in practice a lot of their policies are actually worse. A National sales tax really negatively impacts poor people in blue states
“It’s depends” is the right answer. At a 5% flat tax, it’s not regressive. At 20%, it is. We would definitely need to do a national study to see what the right number is. That’s why I’m more aligned with a consumption tax. Right now, we punish income, so we incentivize consumption (make more, spend more). We need to incentivize saving by make consumption punitive in a sense.

I’m open to all ideas, honestly. But wealth expropriation, like is suggested by the communists and socialists in the legislative branch, signals the dying breath of an empire.
My income tax bracket was 10%.

The sales tax rate is 10%.

But they are not the same.
In the income tax state roughly a third of my paycheck was removed from taxes, but 10% was State income tax withholding. 

But let's look at the breakdown. 

$30k per year.

That's $2,500 a month.

10% is $250 a month State income taxes. 

$212 FICA

$250 Federal income taxes. 

$1,200 a month RENT. (Not a legal income tax deduction).

$200 a month food (also not deductible).

$450 a month clothing, furniture, entertainment. (Not deductible, and subject to sales tax).


So under a 10% sales tax I paid $450 x 10% = $45 a month in sales taxes.

Rent, and food are not subject to sales taxes, but are paid with post income tax income under ""progressive"" income taxes. 






>Not a marxist. 

All marxists say that. A progressive income tax is one of the planks in Karl Marx's book ""Communist Manifesto"".

You need to ask yourself a question. 

Is the purpose of taxes to fund the government, or achieve income equity?
The math is pretty simple.

Income tax, you are taxed on ALL of your income. 

Wealthy taxpayers can exclude some of their income by using the many deductions available. 

Other than the basic individual deduction most of these are unavailable for poor, and middle class. Irrelevant really as these are attempts to make an inherently unfair tax less unfair, and are given to the politically connected. 

A retail sales tax taxes retail sales.

Rich have more discretionary income to spend. 

Poor have fixed expenses like rent, food, medical care that take up to 90% of their income. These items are not subject to sales taxes. 

That leaves only 10% of their income taxed under sales taxes. How is this regressive? 

100% of their income is taxed under income taxes, and rent is paid with post tax money. How is this not regressive? 

You are very insulting, but have yet to present a single counter argument except ""Google"", and ""brain damaged"".

The math doesn't lie.
I’m not being literal. I’m discounting the value of normative economics because it quickly devolves into lobbying efforts around fairness and equity. You’re wound up pretty tight this morning. Grab some coffee and relax. It’s the Sunday thing to do.
If your game is denying that international companies moving patents and holdings through chain of international tax law to avoid corporate tax exists, then you are dreadfully unqualified to be behaving so dishonestly. Its the kind of lies that are cute for a toddler but sad for an adult.
It’s really funny how you are all over this post, telling people they’re wrong. But when someone slightly pushes back, you completely shut down and refuse to elaborate. How often does that actually work for you?
As an accounting fundamental, higher corporate taxes must result in lower payments to shareholders, lower wages, or higher product prices. The actual incidence of corporate taxes on workers, consumers, and capital is therefore key to debates on tax policy. 

In other words, what I’m referring to is just accounting 101. Your failure to understand is just a result of your own low iq which can not be helped unfortunately
https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0512/how-large-corporations-get-around-paying-less-in-taxes.aspx
This is less of a Red Blue issue than a Rich Poor issue.  

The wealthy need to take on a larger share of the tax burden for it to be ""fair"".  Which brings me back to my initial comment, that ""income"" needs to be redefined, and a 2% annual wealth tax on people with a net worth of over $1 billion is a good place to start.
Respectfully, you are wrong on all counts here.


X% will always be a higher percentage of a poor person's income relative to a rich person, thus placing a higher tax burden on the poor.  The burden of tax must be distributed equally across incomes, regardless of the total amount of tax paid.  Therefore, whatever X% of a flat tax is irrelevant.  The idea of a flat tax is inherently regressive and 5% vs 20% vs X% wouldn't change anything about that.

Absolutely nobody serious is proposing anything even close to wealth expropriation, and it's definitely not an either/or scenario, so I'm not really sure how that fits into this conversation.  

Raising taxes on the wealthy or even a wealth tax is a completely reasonable reaction to the levels of income and wealth inequality that we see today.
So only a Marxist wants a progressive income tax?  You need to get off of libertarian twitter because that's not how things work.

Marx also wanted the working class to own guns so I guess I really am a marxist. Lol. 

I'd also like to point out that the only person talking about equity here is you, so according to your own rules, you are now Marxist. Which makes sense because you also can't do math.  

However, I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit here and be lectured by a filthy communist.

Go eat your potato somewhere else suca.
It’s ok I didn’t think you would.
Im sorry that you feel me pointing put everything you are claiming is patently false and not valid usage of terms as aggressive. Perhaps reflect on that yourself.
The US literally already has a global minimum tax called GILTI designed to stop this exact thing. The global agreement is based off of that tax, which is why the new agreement doesn’t actually change any behavior of US multinationals. In fact, the new agreement would  most likely provide the US with less tax revenue than what we currently get. 

This is what I’ve been saying the entire time, but you’ve been more interested in avoiding an actual discussion, probably because you have no idea what you’re talking about
Sorry, but thats simply not true. You got caught outright lying about multiple thing. You are more than free to continue believe that you have someone shut me into a corner by making statements so obviously made up from whole cloth that the patterns and scissors are still lying around. It affects absolutely nothing but your ego.
No, no its not ""simple accounting"". The decision making process for pricing is incredible complex and because taxes are an after the fact, percentage based cost, they do not have a preemptive affect on prices.

Further, we have mountains of real world evidence; corporate taxes do not meaningfully bump prices, and have a positive effect on inflation.

You do not know what you are talking about
How can you value wealth.  It’s rather subjective.  It needs to be taxed as an inheritance.
The wealthy people in the US (top 1%) pay 40% of all tax receipts, top 10% pay 70% and the top 25% pay almost 90%.

The bottom 57% pay no tax.
Source: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/03/25/57percent-of-us-households-paid-no-federal-income-tax-in-2021-study.html

So how much more do you want to raise taxes and on who?
Wealth taxes are probably unconstitutional tbh. They also have some pretty negative side effects. Why not just tax income more?
You haven’t heard folks like Elizabeth Warren and Sanders use phrases like “a one-time wealth tax?” This is used constantly so they fund their social welfare schemes.

100% agree with your comment above. Taxes are supposed to be punitive. You are paying to support the government. I do not agree, fundamentally, in refundable taxes to redistribute wealth. Freedom is not dependent on the amount of money you make. 10% of a rich persons income is the same percentage as 10% of a poor persons income. The rich don’t consume freedom at a more rapid rate than the poor. I fundamentally reject the argument that they should pay less.
Marx wanted his revolutionary (Brownshirts, Bolsheviks,...) armed, not everyone. 

By definition a flat tax is neither progressive nor regressive. 

The only purpose of a progressive tax is net equality of income after taxes.

And that is exactly what the US progressive income tax tries to accomplish. 

It it a tax on the working class, and ONLY the working class. 

The rich live on stock options, and capital gains, not earned income. 

By definition only the middle class work on an annual salary.
Get over yourself. You didn’t point anything out as false. Go reflect on shoving this.
No, foreign controll taxes are not the same thing as this proposal, again, simply trying to steam roll the discussion with made up facts doesn't work against adults.

Good day.
Hey your talking about what you don’t understand again.
Give me literally any specifics at all, instead of trying to deflect. Tell me, specifically, what I’ve lied about. Or tell me how taxes on the wealthy stop inflation. You’ve got to defend your view at some point
It may not be simple to you but it is to anyone with a brain. lol. It is literally a fundamental law of accounting. Corporate taxes are passed on to either shareholders, wage earners at the company, consumers of the product, or some combination of the 3. In other words, the people always pay the tax. You need to stick to simpler subjects, clearly.
So what? 

Someone worth $100,000,000 isn't going to feel an extra 5%, so I don't know why you're acting as though the super yacht class will starve or experience a drop in their quality of life.

The wealthy pay more tax because they have more money.  Poor people can't afford to pay more in taxes. So if you want to raise money, you have to raise taxes on the people with the money.
I'm not sure that they would be unconstitutional considering ""rich person"" is not a protected class, however, I am not a lawyer, so I'm just talking about efficacy.

And I'm not worried about capital flight because where are they gonna go?  The only currency worth having is the USD, the ILS, or the CHF, and the last two are too small to absorb too much overseas wealth.  The US is the best place in the world to park your wealth and everyone knows it hence the capital inflow into the US.

The problem with taxing income is that the superwealthy don't earn a paycheck.  They invest in assets or in the market.  So while we should create new and higher tax brackets and raise capital gains, it's not enough to cover the current budget shortfall and unfunded liabilities, let alone expand the social services offered to the populace.
The tax argument is silly when you actually understand that the bottom 45-55% in the US pay no income tax normally.
So what?  I advocate for a permanent and annual wealth tax on anybody with a net worth over a billion dollars.  And you can smear it as wealth redistribution all you want, but that fundamentally is what taxes are.

The method by which the government can collect funds so it can redistribute that well to other projects that would benefit the people, with services that you might call ""social welfare schemes"".

The military, roads, the fire department, hospitals, schools, regulatory agencies, food stamps, the post office, etc.. all of these essential services require taxes, and if the wealthy have to pay just a little bit more so that the people can have health care and free public university and childcare, then I don't think anybody's going to cry some tears for Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos or the Koch brothers.

That's not socialism or communism or whatever. That's just a government taking care of its people which is what a government is supposed to do.
You seem pretty wound up this morning.
Oh, it’s you. As always, feel free to tell me how any of that is wrong. I did write my masters thesis on the US tax that underpins this entire agreement, but I’m always glad to hear your expert opinion
Had you not lied at every turn in response to my elaborations, we might have had a conversation. As it is, you are a waste of time. Good bye.
Heres an analogy i think will be helpful to you. 

Knowledge is like a vast room with a candle at the center. As one's knowledge of a subject increases, the radius of the candle's light expands. But as this light encompasses more and more, so too does the dark perimeter of the candles expand, revealing more and more to the viewer how much there is yet to learn.

You, my friend, have one eye closed and the other pressed up all the way to the candle flame, unable to see the shadows, declaring yourself to have all of the understanding that is required.

No, it is no way a simple subject to approach from any angle. There are tens of thousands of companies each with a multitude of products with millions of people making decisions and millions more people reacting to those decisions.

If anybody trues to say ""its simple"" in economics, that is an immediate indicator that their opinion is worthless.
Who is defending them? You don’t even understand basic terms though people in the US aren’t taxed on net worth but income and capital gains on sales.

Let’s say like you want we taxed 80% of the wealthiest 1%s wealth that money would only cover our deficit for 20 years and the country would be a lot worse off. But let’s say we used that to implement Bernie’s healthcare plan all of it would be gone and accounted for and we would still have a deficit just in that alone of $3 trillion
Wealth tax isn’t the answer. You’re essentially double taxing people’s money. First when they pay capital gains tax, and then every year as the value of their assets increase (in large part due to inflation). Plus, forcing an individual to sell off an asset just to be able to pay the tax is plain unreasonable. A founder would essentially have to sell off his own company’s stock, just to have enough liquidity (to pay the taxes). 

The other issue that if you start at $1B, it won’t stay at $1B. In 5 years some politician will decide that it needs to be lowered to $500M, then $10M and before you know it, people making over $100k/year won’t be able to hold on to their assets due to the wealth tax. 

No, I can’t agree to a wealth tax. It gets too close to government sanctioned theft in my eyes. However, taxing loans over a certain amount (with assets as collateral) makes more sense to me. That would also help limit the issue of money laundering through art.
I don’t agree with you. What you’re advocating for is socialism. We won’t reach agreement because our points of view aren’t compatible.  Have a good day!
Not really. Found some great Seattle coffee to add to the collection (Broadcast Roasters if you drink coffee). Deep breaths, Herb.
Lol, your arrogance is astounding, I’ll give you that
sounds like your beef is with reality. Good luck to you.
I think it's pretty clear to any third party that I understand those things and that I'm saying that wealthy people should start being taxed on net worth, which would imply that I also understand that they aren't currently being taxed on net worth.

>Let’s say like you want we taxed 80% of the wealthiest 1%s wealth that money would only cover our deficit for 20 years and the country would be a lot worse off. But let’s say we used that to implement Bernie’s healthcare plan all of it would be gone and accounted for and we would still have a deficit just in that alone of $3 trillion

What? That doesn't even make sense...

I don't think this conversation is worth continuing here.  Have a good one.
No, thats social democracy, which is what we already have.

>social democratic capitalism — a democratic political system, a capitalist economy, good elementary and secondary schooling, a big welfare state, pro-employment public services, and moderate regulation of product and labor markets. 

Socialism would be a centrally planned economy where private enterprise is banned or restricted and the government controls the means of production.

>so·cial·ism
>/ˈsōSHəˌlizəm/
>noun
>a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.

You should do a little more introspection on your opinions because they are not well-founded in facts.
My friend, if you are trying to pass yourself off as the cool calm one, it helps if you didn't just have an outburst
Uh huh. You keep telling yourself that while saying things like ""pricing decisions are simple""
The top one percent in the country control $34.2 Trillion Dollars of wealth. If we instituted a wealth tax for 80% of their wealth that would be tax receipt of $27 trillion dollars. The US deficit is between $1-2 trillion annually meaning in just 10-25 years if we don’t cut spending all of that money would be gone.

More than likely if we did that we would increase spending and implement something like Bernie’s healthcare plan which has an estimated cost of $33 trillion. If we did that and taxed 100% of the top 1% wealth we would be back to running deficits in 1 year.

We have a spending problem not a tax receipt issue.
Listen pal. I’ve gone easy on you. I’m sure you were history major at some twerpy liberal arts school.  I kindly excused myself from the conversation. Go hump someone else’s leg.
As I’ve gotten older, my tolerance for bs has drastically decreased.
I never said that… you truly are a moron lmao
If we taxed the ultra wealthy of a large portion of their wealth, and continued to tax their high earnings, that would *substantially* reduce their ability to ~~bribe~~ lobby congress into enacting corrupt policies.
Lmao is this a walking talking meme

You're correct that you simply disagree on the gov't role in addressing the wealth gap


The other guy is upset because despite that disagreement, you are spreading misinformation about the very real impact that tax policies have on those who are not wealthy.
Oh, you took it easy on me?

Well go back and get your big boy opinions.  I'll wait.

EDIT: Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from Tel Aviv University.  Suck it.
That is patently false, as you have done absolutely nothing in this comment section but make vague, unfounded accusations both about economics and personal attacks that reflect your temperament more than anyone else's.

Your demeanor and language belies an intellectually incurious person who passes their political opinions as the objective base state of the discussion, and therefore all else is ""lobbying"" and politics intruding on your supposed pure, factual economics.

Drink your coffee in silence. It will be better for everyone involved.
>It may not be simple to you but it is to anyone with a brain. lol. It is literally a fundamental law of accounting. 

Mhm. Right. You are a strange one, thats for sure. Bye
That wouldn’t solve the deficit lol and would allow us to increase spending.

It’s scary that someone can say if we tax people on 90% of their wealth and tax 40% of income we will still have massive deficits if we were to implement Bernie’s health plan. 

People bring up something else totally irrelevant.
Go screw yourself loudly. If you’re going to be an asshole, you need to hear it loudly.
I was referring to the simple accounting fundamental regarding corporate taxes, not “pricing decisions”, which is something you tried to insert since you don’t have a point.
That's not what I said. What I said was that taxing the ultra rich would reduce corruption in the government. Which it would, since a lot of the corruption comes from monied interests.

What's actually scary is people defending billionaires who make the lives of their employees shit in order to add an extra million onto their dragon hoarde. They'd gladly make you a slave if they thought they could get away with it
Hmm, actually, i think lay off the coffee. It seems to make you quite prone to lashing out at people criticizing your behavior.
You claimed corporate taxes are passed on in terms of rising costs.

The fact that you are desperately trying to backpeddle is hilarious.
I swear, it’s always the twerpy dudes a few years of out undergrad who think they have the world figured out as they drive their little Miata around town. I’m not sure if it’s because they just can’t help it or if it’s the liberal arts undergrad from Swathmore that drives their need to hump everyone’s leg they meet. It’s one of the mysteries of the universe. 

My vote is it’s the Miata.
Don’t waste your time, he has no clue what he’s talking about
I find this comment quite amusing. I think you'll find that the only one who had grand claims about the nature of economics was you, my friend. You tried dismissing even the notion of including policy in the discussion of economics as unhelpful. A truly absurd proposition to anyone who has, even tangentially, delt with economics in any real capacity.

This whole comment thread has been you making absurd statements and lashing out at their dismissal, whilst trying in vain to appear as a cool, rational party. You know, you just call it as you see it, right, drinking your coffee all calm and collected. Unfortunately, that shtick got tired years ago and mostly people just see through it nowadays.
“A truly absurd proposition…”

Yep. It’s the Miata.
Its always funny when people act smug then can't back up anything they say. Have w good one mate, and you ""coffee"".

Finally have made it positive and I don’t intend on losing all my money again.
It’s okay I sold my AMC options early and missed out on $4000. It’s an emotional roller coaster for sure.
You should definitely try to lose ~$500, that way a great looking cup and handle will have formed! That's how TA works right?
You need to learn about risk management otherwise this will most likely happen again
but a wealth of experience richer!
daytrading options without 25k or a cash account to avoid PDT rules makes things so much harder.  Id advise getting into a cash account so you can enter and exit trades without worrying.

Edit:options only take one day to settle funds too!

Edit 2: Wrinkle brain move would be setting up a ROTH in fidelity , this is automatically a cash account so no worrying about PDT, and enabling options trading.  Will never pay taxes on gains and can take out money for cool things.    Ive doubled my roth this year doing so.
My chart looks very similar. I started with $6645 in the beginning of march and 2 weeks later I was down to $4249. I'm not even yet but I'm back up to $5852. My strategy was to start doing actual research instead of relying on hope.
As you said, won some because of luck ..and you won’t see luck often. Good luck 😊
8% is still a good return, especially since you went about it in such an ass backwards way.
Don’t discount 8%! It’s breaking even considering your effort, but you’re still winning how I see it.
That’s Resilience 💪
Wow. Good job. Really. It’s harder than it looks man.
Not even year. Tax man still needs his cut
It's hard to dig yourself out of the hole, takes some grit
I’m only up 200$ after trading options almost full time fir four months.  Pretty sure at this point retail option trading might be a losing endeavor.  Time value lost is massive.   And—-exhale—-buying 10k of SPY four months ago and simply holding would have beat this by so much.  Hard to trade against AI algos...I might just wait fir a SPY dip , but it, and get a new hobby!

This is the funniest fucking thing because it’s me
Even is a win. Keep learning bro.
I am just loosing money since I started
You've made it to a level most won't. Congrats!
You're getting smart again 🤔 *bonk you*
Well done man. Keep it up!
But you learned a valuable lesson and made friends along the way. Cue the after school special music.
The power of holding!
That looks like the top half of the us going into canada
Congratulations, but also fuck you lol
I dream about the day I would break even. Not much hope though...
That graph looks awfully similar to AMC/GME daily.
Get in GME today and you’ll rocket
What app is this?
Wow Robinhood!  So you will lose in the end, you know that right?  The COMMONWEALTH of massachusetts is suing them.  Thats game over from a judicial level if you didn't know.
…and your phone needs to be charged
Assuming you held things for less than 31 days and took losses, won’t you be actually in the hole because of taxes?
You would start to find yourself in the green if you took all your investments and put them in AMC right now. #ApeArmt 🦧✊
The game isn’t for everyone. Unless this is disposable money, put that into VTI and set it and forget it.
I suggest you transfer money out of Robinhood. It is fucking scamming me. I tried to sell my amc put contracts multiple times today and it wouldn't get executed.
a ledgend
It’s an up an down game. Down 3 > up 12 > down 6 > crawling back out
That’s ok I missed a huge play by one week
Congrats! GL
Since you have 2k does that mean you can only trade 3 times a week?
Better than most
This is not the way, this is the same as everybody who isn’t option trading or doing anything else in fact , you should at least aim for a sizeable loss to make it all worth your while , this is neither here nor there , neither a big gain or big loss ! Do better !
How are you learning options?
Congrats!
this is the way
That’s honestly something to be proud of for starting out.
Kinda like kissing ur sister.l0lz
Try #DOGE

Learn from ur mistakes and do better
That’s great! I’m trying to get there myself.
Did you steal my screenshot. This is almost the exact same.
Congrats. All bs aside, congrats on getting back even. It’s not as easy as it sounds.
Good job
Same 😕

Investing in AMC is a good idea sir, in my opinion it's a very stable investment. This is obviously not financial advice. Peace from 🦍
Congratulations!
Kenny Rodgers - The Gambler
You didn't do it right. You were supposed to lose it all! HAHA
I hope to one day be in your shoes. Only 30k left to break even!
My goal is to also break even one day
Looks like you broke even a few times lol
Is options trading difficult? Or very risky?
nice.  Have you thought about getting a tastyworks or fidelity account for options trading?  Robinhood is a great platform to start with but idk if you wanna stay on it.
It’s be a little easier if it weren’t for that darn PDT rule :(

You should YOLO some AMC calls with a short strike date
I've tried doing all sorts of things in the market since Jan.

The most stable strategy I've developed for myself is to just buy 100 shares of something with high volatility and high institutional ownership, then sell an ATM call above the price I paid for it. If I paid 13.23 per share, I'm selling 13.50.

&#x200B;

You will be paid for offering to sell those shares at a profit, and if they expire ITM you will automatically get money added to your account and they'll remove the shares.

&#x200B;

You do nothing but sit on your hands for most of the week, which is the hardest part of this system. It's REALLY easy to trick yourself into buying the contract back, so just ignore the stock all week. You don't care if it goes up, or down. Come next week, the only thing you care about is whether you need to buy a new stock, or sell that one again.

&#x200B;

You also lower your cost basis by doing this. If you buy 100 shares for 1,000 and are paid 200, but the shares don't sell that week... you have now \*technically\* paid only 800 for those shares. Your cost average is lower, so your escape number is lower as well. Now you can try to sell those shares at the 8 strike. Let's say you earn 100 for that, but the stock falls to 7. Next week you've only paid 700 for these 100 shares.

&#x200B;

Do you see how each time you fail to sell, you actually lower your ceiling? If you fail to sell those shares a few more times, you can recover that 1,000 entirely which then makes those shares 100% profit at any price you choose to sell them. (Personally, I'd keep selling ATM calls until they finally go away)
How many Trades? And what is your win/loss ratio?
[removed]
I read this and I am hoping I am reading my future.  My initial mistakes will take 2 months of consistent tiny gains to recoup.  Switching from wsb to thetagang and daytrading subs has helped me.  Now that you've got a pattern and system, do you find the stress is less?
No one ever lost anything by taking a profit.
Damn... I know that pain all to well
All perfectly designed by Wall Street.
Anytime you buy any of the Robinhood 100 most popular stocks be prepared for a wild ride. Those are  the stocks hedge funds fuck with the most.
I missed out on 15,000 if that makes you fee any better. Its easier to just think you got some profit and move on. The alternative is you not sold at all and it dipped
Missed out 10,000 so far on a covered call amc 😞✊🏻
I also sold all of my AMC at way below $13 for a profit so small it's not even worth mentioning
I missed out on way more then that. I still made a profit though.
pretty much, far as i can tell TA is just snake oil reddit ppl like to sell to new traders
Experience is the greatest teacher
[removed]
You’re welcome
A terrible one - don't use it
Not if it's cash.
Learn LEAPS and the wheel strategy. They tend to have good results.
Cash account will avoid this. Options settle overnight so you can trade daily with no PDT rule.
Switch to ThinkOrSwim bro I know robinhood is simple and easy but once you can day trade freely and learn how to use tos you’ll love it
What's PDT rule?
Do options have PDT rule too? Or just stock margin trading?
Ya fell below the threshold on the last big dip a month ago and now I missed this big comeback. I want pelaton at $82 so bad.
Even with option trades?
If they’re making profit, is there really a difference?
Could you explain this “savings” every talks about? I’m new to trading
The point is to play with money you can afford to lose.
I did that and doubled my money just now lmao. bought them yesterday expired today.
What is a short strike?
This is hilarious
I thought I had most jargon down until I read this 😆 

Sounds like it makes sense, and of course amazing if it works if stock goes up OR down! 

I’ve only been trading equities so far, but this looks like a great entry into options!
Let me go over an example. Let's say you buy 100 shares at $20 and sell 1 contract call@20.50 for $200. Your cost basis is now $2000 - $200 = $1800. If the price goes down to $18 do you sell another call? And then, if the price keeps going to $16, another call sold? 

At $18 you would have lost $2000-$1800= $200. But because you sold that first call you are actually at break even. However if you sell another call you lower this cost as well. 

If you keep selling calls as the price goes down you lower the cost, obviously. What happens if the stocks starts going up and you are assigned the last call you sold? Shares are sold automatically. Here is the big question: What are you doing about the other calls you sold now? Now all your first sold contracts are naked. I guess you will have to buy them back.
Ah, the Wheel.

What stocks do you like for this?
And is the reason you choose high volatility because if you fail to sell for weeks (even to the point you recover the entire price paid) then you still have a chance at selling the stock at some point soon?
I sold my $30 GME calls 2 days before the squeeze started for an 80% loss and bought shares with it. Missed out on $2M in gains but still made a six figure profit from the shared alone
Haha TA is all about price action. That's all I use and i do pretty well.
Oh TA isn’t a real thing? I’ll go throw all my books from the 70’s out then
Nervous cult member found ^
Ok thank you but can you suggest a good platform for me?
Someone here told me it still applies regardless the other day

I didn't know options settled that fast
You can’t trade options with a cash account on RH
You can’t trade options with a cash account on robinhood
It's the keep retail traders poor rule.
Pattern day trading. Trading an asset in the same day (buying and then selling) more than three times flags your account if you don't have 25k equity.
Options also have PDT
Easier to eat when you control the food distribution. Doesn’t take more intellect.
+200% here. Every day this week I told myself it can’t go higher but damn. Meme stocks OP
The date of the option is set to expire shortly.
Is this the wheel: selling puts and then selling covered calls?
JESUS. yeah you win..
Yea anyone that thinks TA isn’t real is a moron. You can draw a simple regression through most daily, weekly or monthly charts and get a clear picture for resistance and support levels that trading will close to confirm.

It’s not perfect, but discrediting it is like saying you don’t need to pay attention to the cards dealt in a poker or black jack game and just worry about your hand...bad idea.
TDAmeritrade
It depends on your needs. Research the top brokers in your location and compare what they offer and how it will suit your trading needs.
I'm not 100% sure but I think it's fine when you use your own cash. From your link it looks like it's only different for trading options.

Pretty sure you just have to turn off the default RH option that let's you use unsettled cash to trade right away to be able to day trade under 25k. Plus you can always swing trade no problem either way.
Options settle overnight on a cash account. 10k settles spend 9.8k have $200 left after closing everything. Now have 10k at open tomorrow to repeat. Careful to not go into unsettled is all.

Robinhood doesn’t allow this but TDA and Fidelity do.
They don't. You'll have to take a break until funds settle.
Yikes, I didn't know that.  Yet another reason to ditch RH, if the meme stock fiasco wasn't reason enough.
If you can’t make money trading 3 times then this isn’t for you
True that. My account exploded upward after i got past that threshold. I still am worried about it though and i have plenty of buffer, but I only trade options.
Isn't it even worse? I think it's 3 trades/week.
Even with option trades?
Worth noting that most brokerages will allow 1 reset of the PDT rule if you claim ignorance.
Thanks. Arse. Ok then, options are:
- Cash account
- Swing trade on margin
- Trade with CMEG
oh yeah meme stocks are very op. I wish I didn't sell my 3 amc shares lmao. I play with small amounts hoping to grow it and so far I've done that. but yeah meme stocks are good but everytime i buy I'm like shit I'm done. like yesterday I was like I'm gonna wake up to no money. then boom doubled
yup, there's an entire sub dedicated to it /r/thetagang
Yeah. I haven’t had a ton of luck with it. My underlying dips so low that I may as well have just gone long and hold. 

But I’m still intrigued. Maybe just need a better underlying
Thank you
the day trading rules don't applies if you are in a cash account

HOWEVER.. when you sell a stock, it takes at least a day for the money to ""clear"" and be back in your account as available to spend

so effectively, you are even more restricted than if the day trading rules applied. 

Let's say I have $1500 in my account. I put it all in a stock for an intraday trade... I buy.. the stock goes up, I sell

that money (let's say its now $1600) won't be available to buy something else at least until tomorrow.. so you're done for the day

you might as well have a margin account and abide by the ""3 day trades in 5 days"" rule.. what I usually do is buy something late in the day for an overnight trade.. then the next day I can sell it
Or you know, sizing your bets and not going all-in.
They do for me on TDA. I can max out my account and trade the very next day if I wanted to, as long as I traded options.
They do, options settle by the very next day.
What options do you normally go for? Do you research it? Or just kind or are you doing ya etc? Looking to go into day trading but so far all I’ve been doing is pumping my account lol 😂
I think you can technically get flagged with three but 4 is the hard rule
Yed
What’s a CMEG
At this point it’s easier to trust in them
holy shit, thank you! i'm a penny flipper who wants to get better, and i'm ecstatic I understood enough so far to distill the strategy into the main options trades.
No problem. Sorry for not a direct answer, but it's hard to recommend without knowing location, experience, trading needs, etc.
Right... but if you have 5k or 10k in your account to begin with you can do more trades with the money you didn't use yet
So you can do three trades each day? Given you divide the amount available into three trades

One more question: Can you sell a call against your buy call?
Ah, yea I meant 3 trades/week is the max allowed, if you are below 25k.
CMEG is a broker based in Trinidad and Tobego, outside U.S. financial control so no PDT rule. 

Also offers 6x margin which is one of the largest (and highest risk)

Fees are a bit unclear, but has potential.
well I yolod 600 bucks in a 30 dollar contract expires next week
yeah definitely
Lol if you’re a penny scalper you can make serious cash if you have the capital.
Well, I can trade as much as my cash balance allows. And I’m not sure about the multi-leg options as I just purely scalp. I’d imagine it would be broker dependent, though.
Yeah, the 4th trade is what flags you for PDT. It’s 4 or more trades in 5 business days.
LFG!! I’m actually holding 39c for next week still that I bought at $2.56 🚀
How so? I'm still learning the ropes and need a strategy.
*5 rolling business days. Bullshit ass rules. Fuck us poors in the disguise of protection, right? Lol.
>LFG!! I’m actually holding 39c for next week still that I bought at $2.56 🚀

Ight I'm glad I'm not the only holding the bag on a call. Lets go! Hopefully we will see massive upside next week. This is quite a big dip.
YouTube candlestick pullback scalping. Madaz money comes to mind. Ericgreenscalping has a few videos of some live plays. u/phihix if you need motivation. He gets a lot of hate but that’s what comes with being a bad mofo haha
Exactly. If I wanna gamble my life away, who’s the government to say I can’t? Lol seriously, I make my own money and I should be allowed to do what I want with it within the legal limits. Obviously things like prostitution rings, drugs, etc that affect others negatively should be outlawed, but why forbid me from taking a gamble and paying someone else’s bills? Lol
Nah I rolled it at a slight profit to 06/18 40c which is also currently up a little bit. Since I didn’t wanna sell my meme stock calls yet, I rolled them forward since closer exp calls gain more from those big surges
They know money equals power. They don't want us rising to their level if we figure out and master their game.
you think we will see 30+ next week?
Maybe late in the week but Im 99% sure June 14th and 29th

The olympics will have blockchain powered tickets to avoid UCL final scenario,107.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/vdxgi0/the_olympics_will_have_blockchain_powered_tickets/,"What is so special about blockchain that it will reduce lines and scams?
Which blockchain though? Where's the alpha!?!
I don't get the benefit?

What's different to today? Look at Roland Garros (Paris). When you buy tickets you get them in the Roland Garros App. So you now they are legit.

If you buy from 3rd party, you get them transferred from the 3rd party via email to your Roland Garros app. So you now they are legit.

I understand that paper tickets that can be easily scammed. But there are already many teams using digitalized technologies that already work and are easy to implement (Roland Garros, FC Bayern Munich, ...).

What's the benefit of blockchain powered tickets then?
Blockchain, crypto, every industry is integrating it bit by bit
If I go to any online marketplace tomorrow and advertise two tickets to the Olympics, there are enough people that would just buy those tickets and not think twice about it. You can have some great centralized or decentralized tech, but scammers are going to find ways to scam you.
If the tickets were numbered and booked online. A database with the last 4 digits of the payer’s credit card would be proof enough.
Have you a link / source for this  information please.
More and more industries are really considering crypto to innovate and adapt to these changing times. Olympics is just one of these industries. E-sports is definitely another. This innovation is really interesting. That's why I've got my eyes on Nobility.
> the French companies are toying with the idea of using blockchain tech for tickets distribution.

Source? :)
French officials are just trying to save face after all their lies and incompetencies. Let them try to make a bmockchain and ridicule themselves even more
Blockchain is already doing that and in a major way in fact. By any chance, do you know Sports metaverse and the digital world of sports they're creating? With its brilliant design in connecting fans to their favorite sports, one of the major incentives is getting tickets, at incredibly cheap costs with even better experiences, if the user is part of the NFT club. Like you said, blockchain might revolutionize how tickets are acquired and it's quite interesting that it's already happening
Sports is increasingly making its way into the blockchain space, giving it widespread adoption; other industries like music, entertainment, and so on are also finding their way through the platform. I also recently learned of a project that will use NFTs to transform the Sports ecosystem by bridging the gap between sports enthusiasts, their idols, and the sports they love. I have a big flair for sports and I think all of these from your mention to the metaverse will be a great deal for me.
What is so special about the ability to verify without flaw any transaction or digital information with the possibility of someone forging a ticket close to zero. If you had such a capacity would you sell tickets at a stand or maybe through an app
Honestly, not a whole lot, but it's still interesting. You could avoid fake ticket scams since the authenticity would be verified, and you would also make 3rd-party reselling easier (I personally don't mind scalpers, and I don't get why people complain about them). You could maybe just use a digitally signed PDF for this, since that'd be good enough to verify authenticity. If the ticket isn't bound to someone's name though, someone could sell the same ticket to two or more people.
Your question is worded in an unusual way. As if you dont understand blockchain and are only here to troll.

Please establish good faith by describing how blockchain is in fact *special*.
I'm guessing VeChain.  That's what UFC just announced they're using.
I'll definitely be watching this race! A real olympic competition!
I think the benefit is that the information systems infrastructure and operational costs required by current ticket management systems — like the Roland Garros system you described — can be reduced by using smart contracts on a blockchain instead of servers, databases, and complex private networks. 

Current systems are incredibly complex and expensive to run and maintain. Smart contracts are a cheaper and more elegant solution.
Agreed and I think in some cases it's a good thing.

Whenever blockchain is mentioned, I just like to understand what problem it's solving that can't be solved with traditional database solutions.
Agreed, crypto is currently rife with scamming.

It would be interesting to see how that's being addressed here.
I think, with blockchain adoption, some kind of standardization is adapted as well that can help and decrease the number of scams. You cannot stop every scam because of people's habits.
Agreed, it's still very much in its infancy and had a long way to go.

I think we'll find the implementation of blockchain or distributed solutions will be on private networks and not on public networks.

So ultimately they will be centralised solutions using decentralised tech.
Seems like every company would use it for everything. The way you describe it.
You do realize this already exists? At the end of the day, people don’t work for free and that fee pays the business and the employees behind the business. You can argue with their morals and their treatment of their customers, but I’m tired of hearing 100000x the new decentralized ticket system that’s gonna eliminate all fees and ticket issues in one magical step.
How do you see the 3rd party reselling working and how is it possible to avoid fake tickets?

The only way I can see that being possible is through a fully centralised and controlled system.
What they're saying is that there isn't really much unique to blockchains that couldn't be solved by just using a fully-electronic ticketing system.
Your comment is so weird. But assuming you're not being satirical, why wouldn't these companies in that above scenario use e-tickets instead? (No need for web3 as there are existing versions of such product in web2).

Unless there's something i'm missing in regards to the specifics of the looting situation like what actually happened.
Are you being intentionally difficult?

There is nothing this being implemented with Blockchain actually solves vs foxing it with a centralized DB and better API.

Verify ticket authenticity/ownership: api that can verify authenticity/ownership with centralized db.
Way to transfer ownership: have an api that allows transfer of ownership when user is authenticated.

Support for 3rd party resellers: allow api access with no fees

Worried about stealing logins? Force users to have crypto key strength passwords

Now the only benefit is that it will ensure access even if nodes are down and immutable.
Some geodistribution and load balancing will give comparable uptime to blockchains decentralization. Good web security gives you comparable immutability as long as you trust the owner of the central DB. Since you'd still have to trust that they will honor the nft tickets, a level of trust has to be there anyway.

So nothing special about blockchain is the only way to prevent scamming, especially the type of scamming they are trying to prevent. It just gives better uptime and removes the possibility of an insider or really hacker altering tickets.

Blockchain isn't necessary for what they are claiming to fix with it. But it lets them say they are using the blockchain so people will think its cool.

The real benefits are that they don't have to spend as much on servers or web security. They are just going to offload that to the network of other people's computers.

Or did I miss something and there is actually something special about blockchain that can't be accomplished otherwise (as listed above)
[deleted]
I totally agree with you on this one. I just find it so exciting that more and more integrations with blockchain are happening now. I'm actually excited to see Nobility go to places with this one. Combining esports with blockchain - GENIUS!
Anything that would benefit from a public record on an inmutable ledger could use it. Which is not most things but also no no things.
The true path forward is a maximally off chain practice. Small data which authenticates everything else on chain. A lot of situations and ways to cut the cake but just splashing data on chain is clearly the wrong way.

This.

The problem with the ticketing industry isn't the technology. It's the business practices, blockchain doesn't solve that.

I'd argue blockchain actually makes it more expensive for the consumer due to the the high transaction costs.
>How do you see the 3rd party reselling working and how is it possible to avoid fake tickets?

You would know who minted the NFT, so all you would need to know is the venue's wallet address and make sure it originated from there. The same way people give out their GPG public keys so you can make sure emails they send out were actually written by them, the venue would just put their wallet address on some trusted platform (probably their own website)

As far as reselling goes, it'd just be like selling any NFT, except this time moderately useful!
Correct. Of all the blockchain ticketing solutions I've seen, they're just using a blockchain database, but in a centralised manner.

The problem with ticketing is not the technology, it's the business practices. Blockchain won't solve that.

Comments around verification and decentralisation show a lack of understanding of both the problem with ticketing and the application/use cases for blockchain.

I'm not saying it can't or shouldn't be used. I'm just not convinced it's a panacea for ticketing.
Which seems to purposefully avoid what makes blockchain *special*. Yeah, I get that part.
You didn't spend any effort describing what makes blockchain *special*.

And you need to pay someone to build all that, then you need to pay them to maintain it forever, you need to pay for the servers, you need to pay for the insurance for a variety of legal liabilities, you need to pay for a third party service to maintain backups. Or you could simply pay cents for a record to be kept in the blockchain subsidized by the fact the same blockchain is being used by a variety of other businesses and people. You want to minimize all that as if its not important because it kills your argument. Its a lot of money and a lot of liability.
One more time. My point, is that starting off by saying blockchain is not *special*, betrays an agenda. 

You're just repeating what OP said. Like, you pretended to say a different thing. But really just added words and moved the blockchain is not *special* to the end.

Again, why don't we start with what is *special* about blockchain.
> Anything can be done faster on a single random server then on a blockchain that is an objective fact.

I disagree. It's all about scale. A single server can't handle tens of thousands of transactions per second, but next gen L1 blockchain systems can. You need a distributed system to handle large transaction volume — blockchains do this cheaply. Forget about gas fees on legacy blockchains, the future is cheap, modern, next generation smart contract systems.
Right. So not ticket sales then
>As far as reselling goes, it'd just be like selling any NFT, except this time moderately useful!

But every other day you hear about NFT scams or people having their NFTs stolen or buggy smart contracts that get exploited.

How do you see that being any different in this scenario?
I think the blockchain here Is not so revolutionnary or difficult to understand. Company like compell.io already make Zero value NFt that connects a real ticket to a NFt ticket which verifies itself thanks to the metadata. 
Normally in web 2 it would Be as you Said a centralised database which could be manipulated or duplicated.
Blockchain easily and technically Solves both of those issue in a trustless manner. It Also sound amazing to say that it's protected by NFts.
uhh that is what he is asking, what makes blockhain special
So you're saying that a blockchain solution would be cheaper and less risky?

I don't understand your argument about legal liabilities. Could you explain that more and in particular  how Blockchain makes that better.

The cost to process (validate) a transaction on the blockchain is many magnitudes greater than a centralised solution.

No one buys servers anymore, everything is cloud based and it's dirt cheap.

So I don't think the cost based argument is valid - I'd go far as saying a blockchain solution would actually be more expensive for the consumer.
Blockchain is special, but not for this application. That's what they and I were saying
[deleted]
Yeah, I'm not getting why having a ticket on the blockchain would be an advantage. Why do I, as a ticketholder, care about anyone else's tickets? It should just be a transaction between the attendees and the entity hosting the event. This seems like something naturally set up for the traditional client-server kind of setup, since you already need the central authority of the host.

And if you're worried about scams, it seems like a technology that will not allow a central authority to reverse someone illicitly getting ahold of your tickets via a scam isn't a great idea.
I can imagine some benefit to it. Maybe not right now. But consider a future where all tickets are digital. Imagine your centralized electronic ticket validator getting DDoSed with thousands of overheated angry fans at the door. You'd need some some proper distributed infrastructure and top-tier DDoS protection to ensure it doesn't happen. That couldn't be cheaper than just using the blockchain. Of course the blockchain would have to be mature too. EDIT: and I'm sure there are other ways to mitigate this, it will depend on what's easier, cheaper and more secure when the time comes.
If you want to be able to verify a ticket is real then yes it is useful. This acts against counterfeits which could be resold to unsuspecting victims.
>But every other day you hear about NFT scams

Those are usually stolen artwork, etc, or someone uploading someone's art as their own. You could just have a list of venues/etc and their wallet addresses, and then just use that to verify, I wouldn't be surprised if someone makes an app for this if the idea catches on

>buggy smart contracts that get exploited.

You probably won't be interacting with smart contracts that often. All you would need to do is somehow purchase/obtain the ticket, and then just keep it in your wallet until the day of the event.
Wait, neither of you are OP, how confusing.
>So you're saying that a blockchain solution would be cheaper and less risky?

Yes. The less code you write, the less data you hold, the fewer servers you manage, the fewer things you are liable for.

>The cost to process (validate) a transaction on the blockchain is many magnitudes greater than a centralised solution.

Its a couple cents or less in pretty much any blockchain, considering the cost of a ticket I don't see how this is relevant. The fees don't come from the costs of validating a transaction, but from all the responsibilities you have to take on yourself as a company to be trusted to do so. To ensure you are not going to have an outage when its go time, to ensure you are not going to be hacked a day before an event, or to ensure that you will quickly recover all legitimate records if you are.

Having said all that I want to make it clear that I consider every blockchain as they are right now really young tech, except for maybe ethereum but even that is about to go through a huge software update in the coming months, and I personally would think twice or thrice before using them for something as time sensitive as this.
Sorry that we aren't seeing it as a magical solution that is always the best way to fix a problem
That counts as a step forward. Maybe we could turn that into some serious progress.

In what ways do you believe blockchain is *special*?
> Sounds like a great service to spam until it overloads

Same for your single computer. You will need a load balancer and multiple redundant systems. Then you will need to maintain concurrency between them. The complexity builds quickly. Blockchains systems handle all this complexity and provide the utility at scale for a very low cost.
You can trade tickets with confidence, you can use it as a way of authentication at the door, you can check if your ticket has been voided even if their website or whatever is down, its easily and predictably available to develop third party tools around. It's all the good parts of centralised services, with the security and trust of a blockchain, and all the advances decentralisation of data brings. Plus if the issuer goes bust, they don't need to pay to maintain their data publicly, it's just there... there's lots of reasons. Like the person said, not all applications are ideal for it. But there are many tickets, documents, contracts, tokens, deeds and such where this would be beneficial.

In this Olympic example, the main benefits would seem to be that because the data is immutable and the data is verifiable at will, it'd stop counterfeiting and there could be other benefits such as let's say you treated tickets for a massive concert as tokens (Or NFTs, whatever). Could also be day one pre sales on something, whatever. Anyway. How many times have you heard about people getting fucked over in these situations because the site crashed? What if they could buy tokens on a dex or cex? The issuer could still build things like commission into the contract as not to be too divisive with existing businesses and systems. This could apply to future Olympics and such.

Various benefits I mentioned throughout the post also apply to things like expanding the idea to things like property deeds or car ownership or whatever you likes. But it doesn't make a lot of sense for me to trade you lighter tokens, or chilli competition entry tokens to the place two streets away from me. Its not universal. You can be reductive of tickets as tokens or nfts with selective thinking as you can tout them.
You are a very dense person. 

You want a random person who is asking what the advantage is here over a traditional ticket database to... describe some random advantages of putting data on a blockchain? The fuck?

Go away troll
>Yes. The less code you write, the less data you hold, the fewer servers you manage, the fewer things you are liable for.

I'm not sure I follow. Why would a blockchain solution be less code?

Have you considered the additional overhead to ensure the blockchain doesn't get hacked.

>Its a couple cents or less in pretty much any blockchain

Really? Ethereum Gas Fees would like a word. :)

>To ensure you are not going to have an outage when its go time

This also applies to blockchain. Solana is a good example.

Have you considered the time it takes to validate a transaction/ticket. Again blockchain can be many magnitudes slow than a traditional solution.

> to ensure you are not going to be hacked a day before an event

This is blatantly wrong. Blockchain projects are by far the most hacked. Rarely a day goes by without hearing about another hack or poorly tested smart contracts that have led to millions of dollars in losses.

> or to ensure that you will quickly recover all legitimate records if you are.

I understand what you're trying to say here. Although this is more a hypothetical problem. 

This may have been a problem in the 80s/90s. However, with modern replication processes (for example) this really is a non issue.
You're sounding real *special* yourself actually
[deleted]
Also things like real transparency on occupancy; you can verify real tickets are with real people, and that they really use them, for another example. Both privately and publicly this could be useful. No one could say your concert didn't really sell 5000 tickets, and 4500 people showed up and scanned them.
Instead of using your words to describe what I'm saying. Have you thought about using my words to describe what I'm saying? 

It can be scary starting from a point where you don't have all the answers. I'm here to offer help if you find yourself struggling.
>I'm not sure I follow. Why would a blockchain solution be less code?
>Have you considered the additional overhead to ensure the blockchain doesn't get hacked.

You wouldn't write a blockchain from scratch. 

>Really? Ethereum Gas Fees would like a word. :)

Don't use ethereum then.

>This also applies to blockchain. Solana is a good example.
> Have you considered the time it takes to validate a transaction/ticket. Again blockchain can be many magnitudes slow than a traditional solution.

Didn't I say that I consider the blockchains as they are right now to be very young tech? Maybe you missed the edit. Anyway, most have never experienced an outage at this point, which is already pretty good. Some have cheap transactions and experienced no outages right now. 

>This is blatantly wrong. Blockchain projects are by far the most hacked. Rarely a day goes by without hearing about another hack or poorly tested smart contracts that have led to millions of dollars in losses.

This is irrelevant to the discussion at hand. Unless you can show me a situation in which the ledger was changed by a hack. Which is the part of the blockchain that would be used for this purpose.

>I understand what you're trying to say here. Although this is more a hypothetical problem.
>This may have been a problem in the 80s/90s. However, with modern replication processes (for example) this really is a non issue.

Its not a non-issue at all. Companies can take days to do it right now and it isn't cheap.
It depends on the consensus mechanism used.  Some are incredibly efficient.  It sounds like your understanding of Blockchain is limited and/or outdated.
Ok I'll bite; explain what consensus mechanism achieves negative overhead for it to beat out running on bare metal?

This isn't some gotcha or dunk on blockchains they are pros and cons efficiency is just not one of the pros. You want a real argument for tickets on the blockchain say something like composability. 

The open and trust-less nature allows everyone to build onto of the tickets that have been sold in the past to provide value adds such as artists giving early access to tickets to long term fans or a digital copy of the new album from the tour without having to coordinate with the ticket seller. No one owns the customer list at this point so they can't block an artist from reaching the full fan base or charge for it.
It doesn't make any sense to compare a single computer running a database ticket sales system to a single blockchain node running a smart contract ticket sales system. We need to look at both solutions at scale and compare the costs.

The traditional system is probably going to be cloud based consisting of: application containers, database containers, application software, software libraries, container orchestration, network routing. You need a team of engineers, dev ops, and system administrators to build and maintain it all. Plus you're paying for bandwidth on your cloud service provider.

A smart contract system might consist of a lot of the same underlying parts, but the infrastructure is shared so you don't manage it or pay for it directly. The costs are paid indirectly through transaction fees. You still need a team to write and manage your smart contracts.

Both systems have the same costs for building, maintaining, and running the front end.

If a smart contract platform can fulfill the requirements of your application, are the transaction fees less than the infrastructure and operational costs of running a traditional application stack? Which solution enables you to sell your product at lower cost and/or with a higher profit margin?

It's a paradigm shift, like going from hardware to cloud, but I think there are a lot of applications that will be cheaper to build on a smart contract platform compared to the cloud. Plus you get benefits like composability, data integrity, network redundancy, etc.
Well, negative efficiency isn't something that is even possible, that I'm aware of.  However, I would say the two most promising in terms of efficiency are Proof-of-Stake built on Byzantine agreement, and Proof-of-Authority.  Both allow orderly block processing that adds little overhead compared to bare metal, but still provide the trustless, immutable qualities of Blockchain.  Now Proof-of-Work?  Oh man, it's incredible how inefficient that is. Intolerably so.  I almost wish it was outlawed globally, except I know it would be impossible to enforce.",,,,,,
Privacy and anonymity enabled in crypto through Zero-Knowledge Proof technology.,145.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/y756r2/privacy_and_anonymity_enabled_in_crypto_through/,"How does railgun obfuscate on a transparent ledger like Ethereum?
With so many speculations around regulations, it isn’t hard to imagine that one day, crypto trading platforms will be required to have a privacy shield that can produce financial reports in order to be legally permitted to operate in certain economic areas and host consumer trading funds. The optional view-key will be quite important if it comes to that
ethereum should build privacy protocol into layer 1,so users don't have to buy privacy
Very interesting post! [We're actually publishing a multi-part series](https://scrt.network/blog/beyond-zk-guide-to-web3-privacy-part-1) on how ""zk"" doesn't go far enough to ensuring our decentralized systems are also private enough. Also, building on a public-by-default foundation like Ethereum is very challenging and undermines the security and sustainability of any privacy solution being built on top. The future is likely private-by-default computation blockchains like Secret Network.
I think privacy by default is the best way to go. 

There is some interesting value in things like railgun and ZK tech because of bringing some privacy to the 0 privacy chains. 

But overall, the future needs private by default because in the end, security is only as good as its foundation.

I'm of the mindset that at some point in the near future, privacy functions via ZKP will be the standard that Web3 dApps will be expected to provide to their users. Imagine having the ability to scroll through a list of pseudonymous Chase Bank accounts and view not just their balance but all their transactions. 

Institutional adoption and regulatory compliance, in my opinion, will require that Web3 financial services offer privacy. Biases aside, I think auditability will also be a supplemental requirement alongside privacy, requiring that:

1. Users are provided with privacy so their assets and transactions are not fully visible to the general public and...
2. Allow for all transactions to be audited by token issuers for the purpose of complying with legal investigations.
Absolutely agree that on-chain privacy is very important nowadays and we have to talk about it. Find this discussion very interesting: [https://twitter.com/MantaNetwork/status/1582752903064092673?s=20&t=fje4wDvxNwFbBw2kyH2Uiw](https://twitter.com/MantaNetwork/status/1582752903064092673?s=20&t=fje4wDvxNwFbBw2kyH2Uiw)
Privacy and energy efficiency will be everything in the next cycle. We can all see both aspects mentioned regulary in the field of debates in this space. In the privacy i am with XMR since it played a big role to expose the crypto ecosystem to privacy solutions,still going strong. But ofc. RAIL could also fit in very nicely in the area with its ZK tech. Privacy is coming for the enterprises, not tomorrow ofc. but its getting there. Institutions will also be active in the carbon neutral area, all topics rolling around energy in the recent years. Some are allready getting hit with huge funds.. GEM got in VLX with $135M. That is literary higher value than the mcap of the project + partner of Ferrari,fastest EVM chain, no brainer. Adding ALGO for a good ROI pick,with some big whales hiding over there from the WEF circle, FIFA partner..
I think the privacy narrative is really the key to any type of true adoption outside of a dystopian future.  

We really need to support all of the innovators working on this issue.  Those with working products and those recreating the possible.  

I do think ZK has a big part of the future. But i don't think it is the whole picture.  We need more.

I didn't know about Railgun before, so thanks for the mention, cool to see more dApps on Ethereum deploying zkps.

Some folks might also be interested in the asset-agnostic protocol that we're working on, which deploys a custom ZK circuit so that all assets, fungible and non-fungible share one shielded set. It's a layer 1, but it connects to Ethereum via a custom bridge we designed, that minimises trust. There's an article on the Ethereum bridge in the pipeline, but here are the [specs](https://specs.namada.net/interoperability/ethereum-bridge.html) \- (any feedback welcome). If you want to checkout Namada, I can recommend [this intro](https://blog.namada.net/what-is-namada/) article.
As far as I know, it is a deployed smart contract protocol that uses zk-snarks, which is a little technical and relayers to achieve absolute shielding of balance on the blockchain. You might want to look a little deeper to understand how it fully works. However, it was demonstrated at the last DeFiCon and it works impressively- balance and history totally unreadable on etherscan after a transaction was initiated through it.
I want to believe the transaction details are overlaid or covered with series of incoherent characters to cover up the exact details.
Your last sentence says it all, the view key is the audit feature of the platform it like a bridge between privacy,Transparency and regulations.
Ethereum's development of a layer 1 privacy protocol is a commendable initiative; however, with Railgun, you do not need to buy privacy; instead, you simply connect to the platform to enjoy privacy.
>I think privacy by default is the best way to go.

Well, privacy isn't default in blockchain. Users need to take intentional steps to shield their wallets through the tools that are designed for it. A better option is the smart contract of privacy protocols being integrated with dApps so that privacy is enabled, even while interacting with them.
[deleted]
This is do able but my reservations will be the process of audit, so far most privacy protocols like Railgun, secret and others offer a view key feature where the transaction initiator releases the key to allow the view/audit of the transaction, if done the opposite way where the token issues have this power to view at will then the need for privacy is defeated.
Indeed it is. I am convinced that the relevance will become more prominent the more people begin to realize the risks (censorship, targeted attacks etc.) that are associated with their entire transaction history totally visible on the blockchain ledger.
> balance and history totally unreadable on etherscan after a transaction was initiated through it.

with totally unreadable you mean that the numbers in etherscan were gibberisch?

so the numbers where not matching?
Funds are held in a private pool with a network of Relayers (essentially wallets that submit transactions on chain for confirmation on users' behalf). Transactions then appear to originate from the Relayer address.

In addition, transactions that take place entirely within the Railgun system like sending tokens to someone else have all details hidden such as token type, asset, and amount.
Its a non-token gated platform, that's majorly one of the reasons its fast becoming a favorite.
There are private by default blockchains. Secret Network for example. And Monero.

What you say is true for public ledgers like Ethereum.
I edited it to make myself clearer. My bad.
""Unreadable"" there is actually contextual. Basically, nobody will be able to see the shielded transaction history or balance.
so besides etherscan no on chain analytics wont work either?

That fossil chart is an exception. Intraday trends 1min chart usually have 2-4 waves, that one has many more. Whats the timeframe there? How many times did you try this strategy?
I’m not typically a fan of posts about trades taken and whatnot, but I love the simplicity of this. A lot of experienced traders who I’ve heard talk about the generalities and basics of trading will say something along the lines of “trade *with* the mechanics/structure of the market, not *against* it.” Don’t get in front of the whales, follow in their wake and get your fill of market scraps.
What platform do you use?  Mind sharing your filters?
I can't believe how much negativity the OP and their strategy are getting.

Personally, expanding my reading, knowledge and understanding is why I roam around on Reddit and reading experiences and the strategies of others, whether you agree with them or not, isn't going to hurt.

If you're intrigued by it; learn a bit more. If you think it's shite; move on. But what's the point of knocking someone when they're prepared to put their own thoughts out there. We wouldn't have half the knowledge we have, without people putting various thoughts and opinions online about their trading experiences.
When do u sell?
Anyone know how to do a ""% change from open"" filter on thinkorswim?  I use a somewhat similar strategy--buying an upward-trending stock while it's above the 34 ema, and using the 34 as my stop loss point.  Stock selection is critical to this strategy though and the part I'm still working on, and I'd like to try using a % change from open filter.
My entry would have been in that consolidation on the pullback a few minutes after yours. I don't trade in the first 20 mins either. Good trade.
You should keep an eye on the float% that is traded the RVOL and the if the volume is increasing or decreasing.  


Also keep the charts with the important variables.  
Keep everything clear and disciplined.
This kind of works. Until you put it all online. And then they halt trading.   You get hit with that a few times.  And it’s ouch! :-)

Happy trading. :-)

At the bottom of course
Depends on various factors, if a huge surge occurs (over 5% in under 5 minutes) I sell at the first sign of the candle going opposite direction. Otherwise slow gainers I ride the pp signal slope on 200 back period till it turns red. MACD can also help with identifying potential exits before a huge dump.

I just use %change on that and it gives me a pretty good idea. You can also add a study or pattern type with add filter -> study/pattern
He's not bashing day trading, he's bashing this specific strategy (if you can even call it that). Trading in the way OP posted has no statistical edge.
Because it’s the truth, and if you had any clue what firms have, in terms of tools, data, speed, modules made from the most brilliant mathematician with quants, you and any retailer under 5years will never beat the market ever statistically. Show me a study that say other wise. Blunt as it may be, retailers can pretend they master all these TA, charting, “algos” don’t kid yourself. Intern at a firm and you’ll get humbled.

If I can't find entry before they've gained 4-7% since open I consider it too risky (usually). Should also mention I focus on small cap high volatility stocks so 4-7% is actually pretty conservative. Also like a quick peek at 3mo and 12mo chart to see if price is somewhat steady outside of current movement.
Puts in everything..... haha. I'm in your boat. I'm rarely doing day trades right now. Just buying things that are undervalued when I can. 

And I do watch some of the tech stocks that pump, because they almost always plummet the next day since February. I'm reluctant to short because everything is so oversold, but when it's an obvious setup (See AMD almost every single morning after open) I take a few here and there. 

But my major transition from this period has been from day/week trader to swing trader with 6-12 month time horizons. I may he shifting that time horizon to 18 months soon - at which point I'm just investing haha. This choppy bs is not conducive to any effective day strategy for me.
Most of my decision to buy or not are based on the indicators I use, other screening columns aren't very helpful for scalping intraday stocks or I haven't found any that are yet. For instance, rebound stocks can be all red in the other columns but up by 20%+ for the day and a lot of instances the most pumped stocks for the day have little to no after hours trading action.

I'm aware of what firms have at their disposal. Yes, trading is difficult, and most don't succeed. But anyone who has some brains, the ability to learn, multitask, and can follow a strict plan, can turn a little profit. 

Comparing retail to smart money isn't really a fair comparison. Of course a 35 year old who trades for 1-3 hours a day with planning and research on the weekend won't be beat a hedge fund statistically. Man power alone.

I'm aware OP might not have the greatest edge, or plan in the market. But if they have even a 60/40 success scanning for runners and scalping off support and resistance with some indicators on the side, that's fine. 

I'm 26, been trading for 3 years with a couple thousand. Its grown. I'm profitable, most days. It's fun, and that's enough for me. Spreading FUD is bad for the trading community, could encourage people to develop stricter strategies, or offer advice instead.

Follow up question - what does your entry point look like? I don't understand the chart at all. Your buy point is on a line that just appears out of nowhere.
For the day trader on the go
There is no indication that what OP doing is scalping. In fact he seems to be holding for minutes if not hours. There is also no indication that they are planning out these trades. It seems like they are buying stocks that have gone up and keep on buying as it goes up (if it does). I’d be wary about following this strategy.
You don’t know what we have ready to deploy in certain conditions. Have you worked or intern at a hf or prop firm?

Spreading FUD? I respectfully disagree, there is nothing wrong with giving the truth, regardless if people don’t want to hear it. Giving the warning of retailers being so little equipped and up against in trading, is far from any FUD. If not, explain how It is. It’s actually is encouraging people to think twice before stepping into a field knowing the risk. I also see it as playing devils advocate, with someone who have insight and makes modules for traders.

Trading is just a game for you so that makes sense but I’m speaking to those who want to actually put big money and not a few thousand which doesn’t have skin in the game. To know that it’s not in their favor to be a discretionary trader or consistently profit having a positive expectancy.

Mosaic already had lobbied for tarriffs on fertilizer imports and won, prior to the war embargo. Those tarriffs have pissed off farmers who began lobbying to have the tarriffs removed and it will come up for review in June or July. The nato embargo of Russia and Belarus will just lead to the supply getting sold to India and china etc.. which displaces that demand making western production more available for the west so it all balances out, as long as the supply is entering the global market. Russia and Belarus causing price pressure is only if the supply doesn't enter global markets.

If you look at the last super price spike in fertilizer prices in 2007ish a lot of it was caused by collusion between Belaruskali and other fertilizer producers creating a cartel which eventually got broken.

There are not really any production constraints and production can be rapidly ramped which will crash prices. Companies like nutrien(formerly potash corp and agrium) have mines that are just shut down but completely ready to turn on with all the capex already done. 

The one main constraint is nat gas supply from russia to Europe producers of nitrogen fertilizers, if supply is unavailable or priced too high that creates problems for global production.

I have an assymetrical way to play this with big upside and minimal losses if it doesn't work out but it probably can't take big bets because volume is too low. I don't want to publicize it too much so you have to DM if interested so my trade doesn't get front runners or crowded.
Depends. If it were risk free everyone would buy. Certain commodity may benefit from the current geo-political disruptions. Certain commodity may be more correlated to consumer discretion and spending. There are things we need to buy no matter what. But, who knows. Investing always carries risk.",,,,,,
Differences between APY & APR (in Crypto),267.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/nnathc/differences_between_apy_apr_in_crypto/,"Wow, I always wondered if and what the difference was. Great explanation. Thank you for posting this!
Whata do, great knowledge
Awesome! This is one of those posts where I wish I could give you gold.
Thanks for explaining, I'd been working on the assumption that they were largely the same thing up until now.
What if the yield is paid out continuously? I believe the Compound protocol does it. Has it something to do with the magic number e?
If lending APY, if borrowing APR?
Upvoted you over in r/CryptoCurrency, upvoting you here. This was a really informative post! Thanks again!
nice explanation.  The example using 100% APR seems high though.   Bernie Madoff, the famous wallstreet scammer claimed his clients were gettings 10% APR.
Has anyone noticed APY tends to break down as APR gets large, if your number of compounding events is high?
Realy Thank you for that  


I came with the Doge wave, but I'm devouring all the content I can here on Reddit and I confess I'm loving it all.  
I recently invested in some altscoins from the BSC Network, of course, I can only lose money and knowing that I am at much greater risk than with the most popular currencies, but the information is always good.  
Goose Finance (EGG), Ape Swap (BANANA) with BNB Staked in ApeRocket (SPACE), Cofe Swap (BREW), Ubu Finance (UBU), Salt Swap (SALT), Swamp Finance (SWAMP), PancakeBunny (BUNNY), ​Seascape (pCROW), Exedmee (XED), Typhoons Network (TIPH) and finally Sattis Finance (SAT)  
The latter mainly with a very low market movement in the last 24 hours, I am a little worried, I saw some updates from the developers I have already accumulated some losses, mainly from the exchange of SAT for xSAT, but I'm in this to learn and participate in this universe  
I would like to know if you have an opinion on these projects, thank you in advance! :)  
 I will take a position in the most relevant projects with the most relevant values ​​when in the future when I understand the subject better.  
please don't be rude, thanks :)
Great explanation!  


I had to learn this stuff when I got into WHEAT. I couldn't believe the APY's and how sustainable they were. Great long term passive income for sure.
Thanks for this. Great explanation.
Thanks for your post, now i know more. Hope that my ownr wallet will release in staking products with good apy
This is moon worthy. You've provided a great service by writing this
Great content on APR and APY!
Something is off here: APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In order to get the APY here and this is based on daily ***r*** then ***n*** would be 365?
I feel like I know the answer already but could use some confirmation.  Is APY based on coin price or a number of coins held?  Tried searching and am unsure if I'm just not using the right search terms.
Play with the numbers yourself, you'll see that the marginal effect of increasing N goes down as N goes up.
Not really. APY is just APR that factors in compounding.
100% APR isn't that unthinkable in crypto in the current climate though, in traditional finance it would be insane though, for sure.
Just checked the WHEAT website.  Consensys audit makes me very interested.
They’ll be the first and only BSC project that can claim that feather in their cap. It was 6 months in the making and I’ve heard they cost nearly $100k.

Russia edges closer to being banned from Swift banking system as more EU countries support move,2398.0,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/russia-close-swift-ban-more-eu-countries-support-ejection-2022-2,"too much edging. Now, bust a fat one out.
People should be more careful about describing something as the “nuclear option” when they’re writing about a literal conflict between nuclear powers
Now taking bets, what will happen first

Russia banned from swift

versus

Evergrande defaulting
[https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-swift-expulsion-hungary-italy-sanctions-putin-1682968](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-swift-expulsion-hungary-italy-sanctions-putin-1682968)

Micronesia broke diplomatic relations so Putin can not vacation there spend his hoard.
The only people who can stop this war are the Russian people. Hit Putin hard and the people will lose confidence quickly.
Assuming Russia is cut off from SWIFT, how do they sell gas and oil?  And how will people pay them?
I know in 2022 the devil doesn't need any more advocates, but if they are removed, what incentive do they (Russia) have to not hack Swift? From what I remember the security model is a house of cards unless it's been hardened more in the last few years?
[deleted]
Conditions for reinstatement should go beyond full withdrawal from and reparations to Ukraine.  A complete cessation of Russia-based cyber attacks and complete cooperation with international fraud investigations should be on the list.
I feel sorry for the Russian people. They will suffer for decades because of Putins decisions.
[deleted]
Imagine if they supported the move of Ukraine into nato 🤣😂 posturing now what a crock
Until the rest of Europe can find a solid fuel supply, this is not going to happen
Kick Russia out of *everything* but let's start with Ukraine
I’m scared Putin will feel cornered and start contemplating nuclear measures.. someone calm my anxious brain
*NATO edges closer to committing to the bare minimum gesture of support for Ukraine.*
Don't they have an alternative. That's why this threat didn't work years ago
It’s ridiculous they haven’t done it yet, its also ridiculous they didn’t seize putin’s yacht as it was sitting in Germany
Ban them already!
Wake me up when theres sanctions on gas and oil
Does the countries who matter do?
Stop edging and take the jump. These news articles are starting to get annoying
Why does he look like a great value mr potato head
Jiminy Crickets!!!  This should have happened the second they invaded Ukrain.
Banning Russia from SWIFT would be a sanction with teeth, unlike what has been done so far. Unfortunately it’s going to hurt a lot of the Russian people that don’t agree with Putin
How exactly is this expulsion decided upon?  Is it a majority vote of a certain group of countries (and if so, who are the countries the get a vote)?  Or do certain countries (i.e. major economic powers) have significantly more influence (e.g. a handful of countries like the USA, Germany, Japan, France, UK) and could collectively boot out Russia on their own?
Edges huh? What would he have to do to actually get them to do anything? It doesn’t matter anyway. Swift is a secure messaging app. They’re making a big fuss about basically banning him from WhatsApp. 

How about impounding all Russian Ships? All Russian Aircraft. Using ICANN to shit down all Russian Websites. 

Put out an arrest warrant for him. Jeesh.
…just need one or more brave souls to delete there Swift accounts in the system.  How hard can that be?
How credible is SWIFT removal the beginning of the end of the petrodollar?
Already banned 🥰
Why is Biden M.I.A ?    This sh-t not normal, he has literally disappeared as soon as the news broke!
Putins folly
Old news, it's a done deal
Putin: *-spits out coffee-* Taylar Swift?

Advisor: No The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication

Putin: ***-spits out coffee-***
After he farts, China gives him everything the Europeans cut off and more
It's done.
Putin wants to expand Russia but he will bring it down.
“Oh I’m going to get off”
Drawing it out allows for dissent to brew internally in his cabinet. The stalling war, the economic collapse, the protests in the streets, the surrendering Russian soldiers, sanctions freezing assets of top ministers and oligarch's, now with swift sanctions on the table, the dissent talks must be bubbling to the surface.
""Cadillac is the Rolls Royce of automobiles""
The carefulness is over. The mad man has his finger on the nuclear trigger. He’s allready put it out there. Accept that this ugly toad is going to end humanity.
I totally agree.  I get they are in an impossible situation.

But it is Russians and NOT Putin himself that are pulling the trigger and killing innocent Ukrainian kids while they sleep in their OWN beds.

Enough.  How the f*** is there not blood in the streets in Russia?   What the hell is wrong with the Russian people that have not done a damn thing!
SWIFT is just a messaging service so in theory being blocked from SWIFT doesn't mean you can't get paid, and arrangements may be made to facilitate some exchanges.

For instance Gazprom might be allowed to establish an account at a German bank and receive euro payments at that location. How that helps them pay for operations in Russia...???

I would expect that European banks might manually clear a limited number of payments for goods (like oil) that they can verify in some fashion, but otherwise the Russian Central bank and the assets of the oligarchs will be largely frozen, and that is the primary objective here.
They won't. That's the point.
According to CNN, ""Thank Bitcoin""

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/24/business/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-russia-sanctions/index.html
european countries won’t be able to buy russian gas and oil, plus reducing gas supply might just make prices skyrocket internationally tho
Asking for a freund.
I mean they can't even stop a bunch of Anonymous kids from breaking their comms, leaking officials and businesspeople's banking info, taking down RT and the the web portals for Russia's Defense Ministry and the Putin administration, and blasting other official government sites and servers with gay porn, how they gonna do anything to SWIFT that we can't see coming or immediately fix?
[Your understanding is about 5 hours out of date](https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/russia-ban-from-swift-on-the-table-as-germany-drops-opposition/).
Full withdrawal including Crimea
Agree. People are tlaking about seizing russian central bank assets and all the talk about seizing assets in general has me very weary. I don't want an extremely pissed off putin.
If he does it means the end of Russia as a country. The us would also be devastated but would it be worth it to Russia? Nope. No one wants nukes involved and any talk about them is designed to scare people.
He's not going to be pushing a big red button labeled ""NUKES"" on it from his office. He has to give the order and it has to be carried out. There's a pretty good chance that along the chain of command several cases of insubordination, with varying degrees of violence, would occur. It's not a popular war amongst the Russian population.
Oh come on man. NATO is doing everything they can and they are doing it wonderfully. Why is it people must complain about EVERYTHING. This is literally a masterclass right now. Not a single country has intervened militarily. And if they did we don’t know what could happen, it could be catastrophic.

Edit: So many people are uninformed and it shows. You’re enabling someone who is very ill-informed by upvoting his original comment. I urge you to to read and gain the correct knowledge.
Germany really dropped the god damn ball on this one. Maybe it wasn’t so smart putting all your energy in the hands of a tyrant
Unfortunately maybe that’s what we need. Russian people need to stand taller than ever on this one.

Go back to where all the trolls live in r/conservative
He mustered a weeks worth of coherence for that one appearance and must now go to hibernation
A little grim for most, I’d say…. But the fact that he has missile screens, and hypersonic nukes means that destruction is no longer mutual.    You ma be correct.
Look i too wish to see this regime toppled and the people of Russia come out on top. But they are a seriously oppressed bunch when it comes to speaking out, the fear they feel is what allows putin and the like to do what they do without fear or reaction or recourse. So I can 100% see why they haven’t gone too hard yet, but to even protest the way they are is still standing up for something. Is it enough? Not yet, but in their shoes I can see why the apprehension may exist.
There’s multiple protests going on with some of former or current government figures and even private company openly criticizing it. And they’re getting arrested. (Do you remember Navalny?) It’s the situation akin to China. Getting the voice heard is already very risky move. Perhaps they’re treated by gov more or less like Capitol attack protesters.
Years of Propaganda is a powerful thing, especially amongst the uneducated masses. But the dissent is brewing!!
If russian banks have limited transaction capability they can quickly become insolvent, knowledge of this can cause a run.  It’s serious stuff honestly.
If that's the point, then the SWIFT cut off will hurt Europe more than it hurts Russia.  Europe get some huge percentage of its oil and gas from Russia.  Cut off that supply and watch the prices skyrocket.
Is Germany planning to pay with bitcoin? They’re still gonna be buying gas, but I didn’t hear anything about bitcoin
[deleted]
Of course.
Fuck putin. And fuck Russia too for supporting this invasion. Europe is more united today than at any time in my life. If they can stand up to putin the US will also. Thats a guaranteed loser for Russia. This is the only way to prevent a larger conflict. If we don't stand together now then we will fall separately.
No, they aren't. I mostly blame them for putting themselves in this situation to begin with. This problem only exists because they let Putin control their gas. The masterclass would have been avoiding this obvious trap, that so many people warned them of.
You mean sending out tweets and displaying blue and yellow lights at night? That's your master class?

For perspective, this is barely more than the West does when Palestine is attacked and we all know the West doesn't give a shit about Palestine.
Lots of protesting by the Russian people. They don’t agree with their government and the ones showing it are being mistreated and jailed.
Nah they guys here for the pay check
This guys a lame duck and a good representative for the US population
It’s amazing how butt hurt you guys get over this guy. He’s a shit president admit it
This guys a total disaster
My belief is that we really have no way of knowing how well those defense systems will work considering it hasn’t really been tested on that sort of scale in a real-life scenario. The scariest part is that this invasion is happening to begin with. Like, when Russia is defying all political strategy and even India and China are asking them to just chill the fuck out, we move into a realm of entire uncertainty. The majority Russian people seem to not be on board with the invasion, but that doesn’t necessarily translate to their military. Without a massive WW3 type situation occurring, the only way I see this deescalating is a coup (ideally with reparations to Ukraine afterwards). I’m not a fuckin expert on any of these topics that I’m discussing by any means though, so form your own opinions. I guess I’m just kind of using this forum to talk about my thoughts on it because these are some crazy times and I’m interested in hearing everyone’s thoughts/feelings on it. Anyone have anything else they want to say about it?
> But they are a seriously oppressed bunch when it comes to speaking out

Ok.  I fully get that.  But their fellow countrymen are murdering innhocent kids in Ukrain.  

They have done nothing to stop Putin.  He has run the country in the ground and still nothing.  He is trying to start WW3 and nothing.

Are we going to say the same thing about the Russian people 10 years from now?
It is not nearly enough.  It is actually pretty pathetic.

There needs to be a lot more done internally within Russia.

It is their leader that is trying to start WW3.
Prices are already high. Germany gets about 40 % of its gas from Russia. But it’s spring and our reservoirs hold enough gas for this season. Our government is working on plans to help lower income families pay at least part of the difference in prices. We will take the economic Hit. It’s the least we can do. (Also sending weapons finally). 

We can afford the gas prices. No one will freeze or suffer too much here. And it’s another great reason to become less reliant on fossil fuels.
Everybody knows it will hurt us but Russia has gone too far and can not be kept on ""diplomatic talks"" with a clean conscience any more. 

The people of Europe are now united more than in a long time and are assembling to send relief aid, accept refugees, even send weapons to Ukraine. Paying a bit more for energy is acceptable.

We can afford it. There are more important things than money.
In Europe, we will have higher prices. In Russia, they'll have no economy.

Bit of a difference.
Progress update, you’re nein hours out of date
Wow you really think nato controls the energy policy of its members? Do you even know what nato is?
NATO doesn’t control what countries decide to do for their energy. Stop.
Your dumb
At some stage in our life the fight for something greater will happen. For Russia this is their moment, the moment we also need globally to reduce the leaders of Russia to nothing, Ukraine will already be far more important in the history book than whatever putin is trying for his own ends. 

I get your frustration and I to agree, at what stage do the Russians say enough and enact a revolution the world has yet to see in decades. 

I do not believe we will say the same about the Russians 10 years from now, I think the world will view Russia different. We can only hope that they, the Russians see this for what it is, not what they are told. You said it yourself, their fellow countrymen are being murdered for my home country of australia that would be like invading New Zealand, it wouldn’t sit well. So we just basically have to hope, they see it this way too. Which they do, the tide will rise, for as long as people feel they can create change.
If you raise your weapon against the state they’ll kidnap or kill your family. I don’t give a shit what happens to me, but my mission on this earth is to protect my children. The situation is not simple. If it was things would be different, I can assure you.
Reading Navalny’s news in last few years, it seems really pathetic. Country attempted to literally poison the opposition leader of registered party multiple times, and he kept on coming back. I think he’s the bravest and boldest leader, but then even he resigned in the end. Same for China. It’s not hard to find the story for those who risked life just to get their voice to be heard on the other end just to get thrown in jail for punishments. I don’t think it’s possible to do this because the government actually does have power. The truth here is that the power wins it for better or worse.

As were recently reminded by Afghanistan, foreign intervention won’t actually fix their inner problems anyways, so people can only wish they’d pull it off by themselves somehow. I feel bad for common people in Ukraine and Russia but I don’t have andI don’t want to have any suggestion for them (like fix their politics and all). Just hoping the West wouldn’t spread problem across the globe for their political interests any worse.
You expect a redditor to be informed before making a comment?!
Lol. Yes, they do. It was their own fault. The US and a few NATO allies stopped the pipeline for four years. That's a fact. This administration lifted those sanctions because Germany was accusing the US of being selfish. Russia did exactly what the US predicted. If Germany valued the people of Ukraine as much as it valued cheap gas, this wouldn't have happened. Their politicians fucked up their energy policy, and they decided to give Putin billions of dollars to fix it.
Doubling down?
Yes, I will double down and teach reddit the basic facts of what happened, if they haven't followed this saga, and no one else is explaining it to them. NATO should have sanctioned and sent all of their support the minute Russia put troops on their border for the attack that everyone had been predicting for years. Better yet, NATO should have told the German chancellor that the sovereignty of Ukraine was more important then Germany's self inflicted energy costs.
NATO doesn’t have the authority to send in troops to defend a non NATO member. Countries will have to do that outside of NATO.
NATO is just a small number of countries. A minority of them could have agreed to avoid this situation, as they successfully did for years when they sanctioned Russia for even trying to build the pipeline, who's entire purpose was to create this situation. If they ""couldn't"" send support outside of NATO when it was requested, then they ""can't"" send it now either. That logic gets you no where, because, of course, they could have. 

Germany idiotically chose cheap gas over the sovereignty of Ukraine. We have been saying this is exactly what would happen, and you guys are still ignoring what happened, telling the people who were mocked for predicting this that they don't really understand the situation now that their prediction was correct and their naysayers are proven to have embarrassingly miscalculated. There's nothing NATO can do now. It's too late. Russia won. You just don't realize that yet either.",,,,,,

Start with Ken Griffin
Start prosecuting crooks on Capitol Hill for insider trading.

this is what those folk over at slash superstonk are raving about
Legalize it and expunge my record already
Just a reminder we tried to have Bernie as president twice and got Hilary and Biden for Nominees.
I'm certainly not a Sanders fan, but I think I could reach across the aisle on this one. As long as by Wall Street crooks we could include people in big banks. Oh, and abolish the concept of ""too big to fail"".

There's a reason why cops arrest YOU for owning weed while simultaneously taking selfies with Snoop Dog.
Wasn't his wife busted for a money making scam that ran a university bankrupt?
2022 and the US is still heavily going after marijuana.  makes a lot of sense!
Start arresting and charging ALL criminals.

So sick and tired of the damage occurring in cities not being prosecuted.  Hell, the DA in STL is letting MURDERS go free.

Simply let the charges sit, lapse, can no longer file.

Totally agree, smoking should not be a crime and financial crime is much more dangerous, BUT they’re also apples and oranges. The same cops busting people for weed aren’t busting people for fraud.

Politicians first !
Legalize it already Bernie! Thats practically the only thing that’s feasible for him to do in his lifetime.
Who are these crooks? I've worked in investment banking and it's not an industry full of cartoon villains, it's just normal people. If you have information about anyone breaking the law, then report them to the police.

Can't say I disagree. Fuck em all
Finally something I agree with him about
damn i wish i could believe this guy anymore lol. too bad hes been enough of a sellout to the fascists that i'll never believe a word he says again
This is irrelevant regardless. I’ll light up in a church if I have to. We got bigger and badder problems than weed nowadays
I used to think that if we got Congress stoned one time, they'd legalize weed tomorrow but now I know that they routinely use so many goddamned street drugs that they imprison people for using because they're living the ""I get to fuck around while you find out for me"" lifestyle.
says to who? public can’t prosecute wall street ppl. As a senator, he should be negotiating with congress to get this done. otherwise it is just another socialist agenda to get votes which he is really good at.
Sanders is a bad parody at this point!
Talk is cheap.  Let’s see some action!
Or at least start busting crooks on wall street for smoking pot. Get rid of the double standard
I'm begging the SEC to actually do a single thing they're paid to do.
Every god damned last one of us knows that's not going to happen.
Can we please just make Bernie the president really fast and just do everything he proposes
And that's why he will never be president
The SEC doesn’t even have to look past their own desk to find crime!
Thanks to some 'monkey business', pretty soon the crooks from Wall Street will have to start selling pot behind Wendy's. They can start busting them at that point if it makes it that much more convenient.

I personally recommend they keep an eye on Gabe Plotkin, the smartest investor of our generation.
The same sanders who stopped saying “Millionaires” in his “Millionaires and Billionaires need to pay their fair share” speeches because he became a millionaire?

The same Sanders who was the grassroots fundraiser for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden because they are ininspirable crooked politicians?

Yeah fuck Sanders.
Good luck with that. The police are tasked with keeping us cattle in line FOR the Wall Street crooks to take advantage of.
How about start with Nancy Pepsi. Please crush these damn people out of existence.
How about start with the politicians.… on both sides!
Oh look another thing Bernie hits right on the head. Wonder if anyone will listen :(
I agree with Bernie, but here’s the thing: the crooks on Wall Street can afford really, *really* good lawyers. People busted for possession generally can’t. And since good lawyers are better at keeping people out of prison, going after those kinds of criminals means you get fewer kickbacks from the private prison complex than if you spend the same time and effort rounding up folks who are just trying to enjoy themselves.

It’s just business for them. “Justice” is more of a vague aspiration than an actual goal.
How about we start prosecuting crooks in Washington? Like maybe we actually let companies compete in a free market instead of lobbying for favorable legislation???
How about we deal with the crooks on Capitol Hill, while we're at it?
I wish, but crooks prosecuting crooks?  Won't ever happen.
Government says no.
The problem with that is people with Marijuana don't bribe our politicians.

The crooks on wall street do.
Man, if only there was a public position to push this kind of legislation forward.
I miss Bernie, such a threat to the shitty system that Fox News threw everything at him to make him seem anti-American. Legitimately one of the only boomer politicians who would make drastic domestic changes as president rather than lame ducking and shitting money into the middle east. A man of protest and his word, it should be enough for us to choose him purely because he has marched and stood for civil rights his entire polticial career.
I have no clue why most Rs and some Ds are against legal weed, that is something that like everyone under the age of 60 is in favor of
But those people on marijuana are only given us their chill and contentment, while the crooks on wallstreet are giving us liquidity, whatever that is, but they seem to think we need more of it, even if it ends up making them richer while we all get poorer.
And shitty cops.
If only those crooks didn't have all the money.
Wow only took millions of lives to fuck up and millions of dollars stolen by white collar crooks. Don't get your hopes up nothings changing anytime soon.
Include every politician (and cdc personnel ) that made millions from drug companies in the pandemic. And are obviously insider trading, while “legally” not  doing because of some sly paperwork. But also, stop busting drugs, period. Legalize everything, tax it.
The loss in revenue for PDs would be significant. Doubt they'd like that.
White collars are the dirtiest of collars
Sanders gonna wind up dead. Anybody that goes after the crooks involving money are in danger if they poke around too much.
Doesn't Sanders siphon his earnings/money through his wife's corporation where he has full control and she's the named owner? And then they rake in the money?

Edit: please read the comments. This is possibly misinformation. Do your own research.
Seriously. White collar criminals make MILLIONS. Probably BILLIONS if you count them collectively. Meanwhile a gram of weed in an illegal state is likely going to get you the same years as 5M in tax evasion or tax fraud.
People on Wall Street have capable attorneys. Easier to go after poor people for a harmless crime
Every senator: “lol no”
Like Hillary
But muh private prison system
Fucking best headline I've seen in a long time
It’s so much easier to attack poor people, though.
He talks the talk but he can't walk the walk
Sanders says a lot of shit but accomplishes little.
For once I agree 100% with Bernie
Usually don't like Bernie, but this is awesome.
That's something the right and left can agree on.

Bust wall street

Bust corporatism

Bust foreign lobbyists
THIS
It’s easier to go after poor people.
Man’s not wrong
If you’re interested in the corruption on Wall Street, r/superstonk is the best place to start and end.
[deleted]
I hate weed but can we just get this guy elected?
Conservatives were heard to cry “but that’s socialism” and we all laughed until we realized they were serious.
How about we start in Congress?
How about crooks in Congress next.
Let's start prosecuting the crooks in D.C. first.
Says the millionaire.
Fuck yeah
Start by voting out every member of Congress over the age of 60! Yes including Bernie, let him crusade from the private sector! Our government is too old and doesn’t want to change. So change them 

Young men and women need to run on the ticket they will vote for age limit forced retirement at 62, term limits and financial reform
Then why doesn't he do and not just say shit to get news headlines? Almost every other non republican congress member has said the same thing for years.
Yet he does nothing.
He has a point
Lol like him and his wife...
Yessss.  👏👏👏👏👏
Just stop taxing the shit out of people
Old lady in the picture know's what up.
“Occupy Wallstreet” was a thing after all…
But the Wallstreet guys have Uber rich lawyers and prosecutors just want to go after the easy targets.
Why can't we have both?
Common sense does not apply to this system and thus will never happen!
The modern day sundown laws.
Occupy Wallstreet 2.0
No shit
Like him, and his lobbyists.
LOL good luck
r/superstonk
He’s not wrong.
We smoke to forget the crooks and live happily. They prosecute us for it.
The truth.
Bernie Very Based
Based
They ain't the DEA,but WHEN they stop and say they can see or smell drugs its their business. But when they think tax crimes are being committed they can't go after them on intuition cause they aren't the IRS?
That’s not how the world works. Money is power, politics is power.
Agree here ...white collar criminals should do serious prison time
Lul. Like that's ever going to happen under this gutless administration. They decided not to prosecute Mark Meadows, which proves once and for all that some people are just above the law: politicians and rich people. 

Far as I'm concerned, it's time for regular citizens to consider themselves exempt too. Use your second amendment rights. The cops will think twice if everyone is packing heat.
Grifter Sanders getting his headline time.

Here is a lesson kids.

US government = Money laundering gun cartel
Oh wow, Sanders said that? That is incredible news and amazing take.
Your right it is never going to happen why should or why would they procecute themselves.
The war on drugs had very particular purposes and this was one of them: focusing citizen rage and anger about crime and criminal activity on these types of “wrongdoings”.
He’s not wrong.
the crooks in govt are much more dangerous.
Get those real crooks insider trading jpegs
Wishful thinking.  We can't even get our IRS to aduit billionaires.
Include crooks in government, like Pelosi.
You can hear the sound of grifters laughing.
Or both
*Sanders says only reasonable things that trend on reddit and news outlets for past 45 years as politicians continue to ignore him and speak nonsense as he alone cannot bring about change*
You guys do realize that would require getting Republicans out of office right? As in voting blue no matter who in the next election? 

Like you guys get that right, or?
Also don't tax it
And they said no
It's easy to say shit like that. He's not a hero.
Marijuana, isn’t nearly as bad as the crooks who steal from us everyday on Wall Street.
George Carlin once said “Congress is tough on street crime as long as it isn’t Wall Street.”
Hate socialists (90% are communist in disguise) but love Bernie Sanders
Oh, i bet your'e talking about Ken Griffin who lied under oath.
How about stop busting for pot and start prosecuting corrupt politicians
I look forward to nothing getting done about this 👍
Tell this to nationwide businesses please, it's bs you have to get tested in order to work at most min wage jobs at a big national business bc it would help so many people if they were able to work there
Corporate jobs you are working in mean nothing. 
The system is rigged at the top.
All rich and powerful people get away with this stuff...just look at Trump who had adult fun for hundreds of thousands of dollars. I mean paid an adult woman hundreds of thousands for signing a non disclosure agreement because they adult fun time. How was that not prostitution? Short answer is there are two rule books one for powerful and one for the rest....I'll give you a hint whose book is more forgiving.
And the crooks in Washington that made millions without working a real job their entire lives.
They need to start busting the big crook on Wall Street.
[deleted]
Fuck that old ass melfa
Since 1991 when I was suckling my mothers breast’s, Bernie Sanders has passed only one significant bill that bécame law —  “S.893 Introduced 5/8/13. The Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2013 which became law in November 2013”

The mere fact of him saying they need to prosecute Wall Street over plebs on the street busted for pot is patronizing. He knows it’ll never happen, joe biden knows, and the country’s owners the wallstreeters know that. He should stop speaking
[removed]
The system is rigged and always will be.  Eat the rich and tax the church.
Banks have always been the biggest threat to our country. 

""If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of  
 their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and   
corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of   
all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent   
their Fathers conquered.... I believe that banking institutions are more  
 dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.... The issuing power   
should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it   
properly belongs."" - 3rd US President Thomas Jefferson
This sub is just a Democrat circle jerk
I'm with Bernie !!
“Old man yells at clouds”
Lol I agree with this take but sanders, like most politicians, is a fraud
He's still alive?
Maybe they can start in Washington, DC.
But Bernie - if we did this, tens of thousands of jail and prison guards would be put out of work! THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!! 🤔
Sounds good, but let’s also include crooks in congress as well while we’re at it. The lawmakers seem to be above the laws they make.
From the guy who cries equality with 3 homes, one he described as a compound.
Like Bernie. 3 homes and multi millionaire in public service. Obviously something shady
This charlatan just sent 40 billion to Ukraine
But the police were literally made for keeping the peasant class in line. They don't know how to stop/prevent/solve real crimes. 90% of their job is just inconveniencing or harassing regular citizens.

In my state the only useful thing police do is stop drunk drivers. Which we unfortunately have a lot of. But in contrast: I live on a busy road, 1 block from a shopping center and 2 blocks from a school, with A LOT of pedestrian traffic, a speed limit of 30, and a radar sign right across the street. All day everyday I watch people drive by at 40+ mph while families are trying to walk with their kids. Never a cop in sight. 

Local county sheriff's deputy lives across the street from my retired mom. He leaves for work every morning in his personal vehicle and then about 2 hours later shows up in his driveway in his squad, parks it but leaves it running, goes inside, and stays there for most of the day, before eventually taking the squad back to the station, and then coming home again in his personal vehicle. Our tax dollars hard at work.
Why can’t we do both?
Bernie sanders is absolute rubbish. This man freaks me out
Joe Biden: No
Both.

Both is good.
Politician says poo poo pee pee. What even is this garbage sub?
With everything he says, it makes me feel bad this senior old commie is trotted out to embarrass himself in the media

I mean, yes. We should decriminalize all drugs and make marijuana completely legal.

That has nothing to do with “wall street crooks” whatever that means. Now, I don’t doubt there are crooks in wall street. But Waldorf knows who they are, he can inform the proper authorities and they will ne dealt with…

But no, less handsome statler, probably thinks it is a crime for these people just to exist.
I don't think he understands what a crook on wall street is/does or how to prosecute them.
Ha ha ha ha ha!!!

Oh, wait. You're serious?

Lemme laugh harder!

Ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love Bernie, but he's just grandstanding at this point.

Reforming the Democrats is a fool's errand and always was.
[deleted]
Start with the democrats and the president who stole the election and give it back to the rightful winner
[deleted]
I love Bernie Sanders
hmm
Bernie continuing to be Based.
The fuck is this headline. Talk about rabble rousing.
52k upvotes for the post and the top comments are 200 upvotes or less. Holy bots

Why is this on r/economy anyways?
No reason we can’t do both
Hilarious as he voted to send $40B to literal Nazis in the Ukraine. As he said Jack shit about big pharma taking govt handouts to experiment on people while effective treatments were available for Covid. Don’t think he said too much about that. Time to wake up and quit falling for the charade lefties. Most of us on the right know the majority of R’s are Neocon scum of the earth. 

Wake up because we need you to help us. You don’t need to fight but we’re going to need cover.
Maybe Sanders should bust himself
1. What's he been up to since he's been chairing..... A SENATE COMMITTEE?
2. Common dreams is garbage
lol what. Go back to 2012 Bernie, you’re drunk.
The crooks on “Wall Street” are also in congress. Bernie, I love ya, but don’t you dare act like your supporters are stupid like the right wing nutjobs.
And why not both? Pot heads deserve it too
That would nice for a change, but it's even more far-fetched than the STOCK ACT passing, and not getting struck down by the S. Ct in a year or less.
Good idea, let people kill their own health with drugs and hate the rich. People that loves the idea that people are idiots do work for the rich, they just like to manipulated the idiots to think that being stupid is ok, so nothing changes, ever.
Why is this in the economy sub tho
I’m always concerned about this type of rhetoric because there are a couple of global superpowers that would love the US to become a country of stoners.
Bust them for both. Fuck weed. Im pregnant and my neighbor has a baby and our other neighbours keep smoking weed and it comes into mine and her babies bedroom. Its gross and harmful to others. Not everyone can tolerate that disgusting  nauseating smell that comes with smoking weed. I hope it stays illegal.
Yea .. let’s raise a generation of subzero IQ dope heads we can easily brainwash into voting for us.. yea.💪
Sanders is the crook you morons
Pro tip, dont smoke, dont get into trouble
While h is illegal, using drugs or making money in the stock market?  Sanders has been in Senate for long enough to pass legislation but has not, who is the real crook?
Okay, thanks for the information, Reddit. What groundbreaking news…?
Absolutely agree! As a hard right wing nut-job I agree with Portugal; decriminalize ALL drugs- redirect enforcement $ for those needing help…
Poorest senator who has two vacation homes and lives a better life than half of the population points his finger at someone better off than him and says they are the enemy.

^(I agree with throwing Ken in jail. Don’t forget Gary Gensler and Jerome Powellwhile you’re at it.)
You can always count on Bernie to deliver a catchy slogan and absolutely nothing else.
Sanders plays a good “for the people” dude, but he’s also one of these Wall Street money boys
Sanders then went and cashed anther ""phat check"" and said laughing all the way to the bank, ""Ain't Capitalism Grand"". I do agree however the Drug War is just a scam to take away Americans' Rights.
Like Pelosi and the rest in congress
Bernie Sanders is the only good American politician in history.
R/economy embarrass itself reporting anything about Sanders.
We got ROBBED of an amazing presidency when they decided to rig the game against him…he would’ve been so much better than what we have now. My God, how far we have fallen. 

It’s sad him saying this is revolutionary or something. Our politics are absolutely rotten to the core.
That's just how it began in Venezuela.

I cannot believe Sanders' stupidity.
What an original sanders thought
He annoys me so much. Always saying the most stupidest hot takes, which are obvious desires of the population at large but have 0 chance of happening. Like “I want ice cream to be calorie free and still taste great!”
Absolutely!
Don’t forget cartels and drug trafficker, literally nobody is doing anything about the opiate epidemic
For crying out loud - it’s the cokeheads not the potheads…..
Says the guy with 3/4 houses living the high life off taxpayer dollars
What a brave thing to say
This has nothing to do with the economy
Too little too late, Bernie. Your ""friends"" in the Democratic party are never gonna let it happen.
well we need to enslave innocent black people now that that communist lincoln set them free, so fraudulent science about virtuous hobbies has been working really well for that.

do YOU have a better idea for how we can enslave innocent black people? noooo. lazy millennials
Yeah!
And in the white house
He voted for the biggest upward transfer of wealth in US history. This man should retire in shame. He could have been great. But he admitted he didn't want to end up like Nader. 

Sorry I ever volunteered for that scum

why is this sub allowing left-wing propaganda such as commondreams to be posted on here?
Colonel Sanders? Damn, that chicken is good. Now I know why ...
Y'all sound like a bunch of defeatists
""Rudy:  woa woa, people are being busted on behalf of the crooks on wall street.  We need low level drug offenders serving double digits, the 13th amendment allows us to exploit prison labor for pennies on the dollars...those profit margins didn't fatten themselves up on their own now.  We go hard in the paint lobbying to keep the media bias and legislation in favor of protecting the wealthy and exploiting the middle/poor classes, why in the fuck would we step our own feet by allowing that bias & legislation to be reduced and for the plebs to take future money that's already in our lane and we're entitled to?

Mitch:   Rudy, did you make sure the line wasn't being tapped?!

Rudy:  I completely forgot Mitch.  We're in your wife's SUV with cocaine in the back, I think we're okay, there's no hackers here.

Mitch:  Well fuck me, Rudy, you know I have to get this powder to the airport by 1 and now r/economy might possibly, potentially find out we love being fucking racist and getting rich & wet as fuck!  Alright, cut me out two more rails, I'm about to hit these slopes!""  - Mitch McConnell & Rudy Giuliani ^((probably))
He is one of those crooks
politicians talking about crooks on wall street is the spiderman pointing meme. u wouldn't have those million-dollar homes without eachother
Legalize it all and make cartels go into legitimate business
They're not busting people ""for Marijuana"", they're busting them because they're drug dealers or sex traffickers that they can't get the proof to get them off the street. Only rich white libs who never lived in the shit or been to jail don't know this.  


They got scarface on tax evasion
Did you know our politicians can recieve money from company’s to suggest bills and laws that would then utilize said companies services or good. Then on top of that, both sides buy shares of stock before the new bill or law or government backed order. Then push it thru. Then sell at the top. 


GREEDY SELFISH MONEY LOVING CIRCLE JERKS at the expense of the Average US citizen.
Start prosecuting crooks in *CONGRESS*.
Por que no los dos?
he's not wrong
Why couldn’t we have had Bernie, bless that man and his little mittens
How about start procecuting theives that are putting grocery stores out of business in lower Income areas?
Ok but also prosecute the murderers and violent criminals please
Fuck and yes.
How about  you?
Him included. He didn't get rich off Wall Street but he gained some wealth off of connections. Shit or get off the pot. Doesn't matter, he'll keel over any day now.
That’s nice and all but just saying “catch the bad guys on wall st” is pretty meaninglessly nonspecific. Agree about marijuana though, there’s no reason it or any other drug should be federally illegal.
Yes and he’s been saying it for 40yrs
Man has a point
I agree Sanders for voicing on ""Stop busting people for Maijuana"", but he shouldn't push for ""Prosecute XYZ for"". By  doing this, he is diluting the whole argument for decriminalizing marijuana.
Hell yeah lmao
Or.... both? 

In a ""legal"" state here, it does still impair driving and current laws aim to prevent that. Similar to open alcohol containers. 

If the cops are too dumb to do much else do you think they can handle tax codes and business law? That comes down to you fedboys
How is this news?
**B A S E D   B E R N I E**
Ah, Senator Sanders. I was gonna say, this seemed like a very progressive move for KFC corporate.
Okay Bernie. Let’s start with YOUR I’ll gotten gains. Well, yours and your wife’s.
I personally dont like the man but I am def behind this.
Porque no los dos?
Dew it. Manchester no ballz.
“Old man yells at clouds and panders to base”. Dudes toothless

It’s low hanging fruit at this point
tHoSe DuMb ApE MeMe TrAdErS aRe DeStAbIlIzInG oUr EcOnOmY
This is why they're only capable of making arrests by saying they smelled one of the stinkiest substances on earth. We need cops with law degrees
Finally something I agree with the old commie on. I say we start with Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson
A majority of Americans support legalization. What exactly is keeping jury nullification from rendering these sorts of  criminal charges (possession of weed) moot?
You mean the predatory crypto bros?
""Politician states his opinion that everyone could have easily guessed""
Doesn't this guy have the actual power to do something?
Like yelling into the wind. Our owners won't allow this paradigm shift
Politician says sound byte!?!
This man could have been our president. Sigh
This post has been vote botted. Compare the number of votes compared to the number of comments and votes per comment.
Yep. It's 2022.
Let’s see your portfolio, Bernie.
That’s a pretty extreme socialist take. Fucking “Dems”.
Pandering
Why would the police go after those who pay them? Surely sanders knows the answer here
Pot makes you stupid. Then you vote Democrat, like Sanders. Someone who has not accomplished anything, has worked for us his entire life, but he's got something like 3 houses.
I know it’s not close to being the main issue, but I hope someday legal verbiage is updated to replace the racist made up “marijuana” with the scientifically correct “cannabis”. 

Not holding my breath though.
I like Bernie, but I’m kind of tired of the “Sanders says” posts when you know nothing he says will get done.
or Hollywood for cocaine.... as the Depp trial showed, it's full of it.
But busting white collar criminals and politicians would require actual investigative work and won’t provide the private prison system with a steady stream of government funded prisoners…
Get ‘em Bernie.
Man Bernie needs to go sit his worthless ass down, he bout picking the obvious and being it's mouth piece until he jumps ship... He's a corrupt clown like them all, it's a requirement...
God, yes, I don't give a fuck if someone gets high. I DO give a fuck that my parents' entire life savings was wiped out by the housing crash and not one goddamn banker went to jail for ruining people's lives.
Sure is a lot of idiot Trump lovers on here commenting
as we should
Thats fine, but I am not sure how those things are related.
This seems like common sense
It really does make more sense to start busting people for cocaine instead of Marijuana
Hedge fund managers ruin more lives than drug dealers.
This won't happen until we start killing our current politicians en masse
Sanders is right!
If you wanna punish wall st.
Buy GME and visit r/superstonk
Thanks Biden. What about them student loans huh….
A-fucking-men.

Then let's move on to the wealthy tax cheats.
Here's the thing about Sanders and ""crooks"". He hires his wife as the ad agency (despite never doing that for a living) for all of his election runs. 

What that means is that 15% of every contribution goes right in his pocket. That is crook like behavior. 

Worse than you will see on Wall Street. Wall Street is all about making money, Sanders acts like what he has been doing is not. 

If you ever wonder why he runs ads after he has no chance of winning, now you know.
How about just starting with crooks on the street
Lets do both!
A broken clock is right twice a day
Potheads don't shoot back so they're easy target
I agree but please put it into actual law.
The millionaires and the billionaires!!!

Err ummm 

It’s the billionaires!!
Which one of his 3 houses did he say this from?
he’s 100% right
No shit. This isn’t news.
Friendly reminder this guy bought 3 houses with your donation money
Nice, people say stuff, great news.

Pack it up boys, we are done here. 

Justice served.
Yeah, but it's easier to beat the shit out of some poor kid with a gram of pot than a wealthy wallstreet fraudster.  They have expensive lawyers and can sue you back.
Hmm, sounds like one of those crazy socialist things he's always spouting, like 'fair wages' and 'you shouldn't die just because you can't afford access to healthcare'. Insanity.
Doesnt Bernie drive an R8? And own mansions?
Wall street crooks are connected to DC crooks.
Biden: cmon man you need chill out
Why Wall Street?? Start at the source , Senate/congress and the kingpin in the white house ...
But those crooks on Wall st are the politician's pals

They'll go after those degenerates who smoke weed first.
I guarantee you, Bernie's as corrupt as the rest of them.
I don't think sanders needs to be talking about crooks.....
Ok but I trade stocks while stoned... so why don't you pick on the uh.... oceanographers or something... maybe the landscapers? the piano tuners have had it coming!
More pie in the sky from the guy who will make another couple of million and then disappear again.
Sanders says more culturally relevant lip service, yet still nothing happens... and he needs your money to help him continue to talk about issues.

How about, less talk more action. Hell would be covered in ice if that ever happens 😂
I mean he is right but he is speaking to those who have another agenda and could care less what he says.  Wish he was the American president.
Ill smoke to that.
Dixit : the millionaire
you mean his coworkers?
Yes or yes?
If you haven't noticed the fake internet / media leftist can put infinite amounts of energy into  stopping people from honking but they won't actually use the same energy to stop actual corruption at all levels. Here in Flint they cried about our lead pipes and made it another virtue signaling parade while completely ignoring all the corruption in city hall. The council president was busted selling city laptops. All the millions of dollars in funding had to switch hands before the leftovers went to the infrastructure and schools. I try to explain to people no politician is your friend and there are very few like Sanders who will never become president because the rich/elite won't let him.

 Alot of the homes established at the same time in America as the ones in Flint have the same problem. Ask yourself how many cities after were discovered and had the same attention as here. I really fear no one really cares unless they are told to.
Or the people in our government, let’s start there, since they seem to be above the law!
Lol people with marijuana don’t have the means to fight back. Good luck going after Wall Street crooks when they line the pockets of the lawmakers.
I agree
It's a great thing to say. Plans to actually do it, though? Ppl often say thing ppl want to hear. How confident is he that he can rally the type of support in the House and Senate? What expanded scope on executive powers would be necessary to make it work, and how soon the next election after would it bite American in the ass?
I think the country has bigger problems than pot smokers and crooks on Wall Street. How about go after the criminals running around robbing, stabbing, and shooting people?! Lock them up and keep them there.
Fu-cka-you Spez!
that’s not the job of the police, the police work for the same people our government work for- the wealthiest few people who benefit from making us all crabs in a bucket.
It wasn't the weed, it was the armed robbery.

Possession just a bargaining chip.
Cant believe that man the american people said no to as president. Fking stupid af
I usually dislike this socialist dinosaur, but I actually support this
You really believe this guy is honest? My god people are naive
“Republicans are against street crime, provided that street isn’t Wall Street!”  -George Carlin
I’m gonna keep smoking weed while buying AMC and GME
Sanders Says Same Thing He’s Been Saying
This guy preaches social justice but then he lives like a king with 5 mansions.
That would make sense. Sanders actually makes a lot of sense. Why don’t you vote for him in 2024?
And as always, no names or enumerated list of crimes will be provided. If only there were a conversion rate for trading captured headlines for congressional votes.
lock up the people walking into target and openly walking off with stuff. Fuck those people.
Will Biden listen?
he says this every couple hours or so, isn’t news
Ha we have one our side too.  He’s like the liberal Lindsay Graham….say all the the right things things on tv but never actually do a damned thing.  Except rake it in for himself.
The President we need
Amen Bernie
Like Ken griffin, the fincinal terrorist
I lean conservative and I would be delighted to vote Bernie for president.
Sanders is AWESOME
Our governor may be the worst on the planet, but the people here voted YES for legal weed, so I guess it’s not that bad.
He isn't there  Why isn't he the President of a once great nation 👏
He always gets most of it. We should also bust the crooks in DC.
What a crazy thought!
Looking at you Ken Griffin and Gary Gensler, you scumbags.
I was picturing an elderly southern gentleman in a white suit when I read the title.
Welcome to Fantasy Island…. Anything worthy won’t happen. Just like IRS supposed to release Trump’s taxes.
[No](https://cdnmetv.metv.com/z50xp-1619719725-16226-list_items-no.jpg)
Like Pelosi and Warren?
His not wrong
If only he was in a position of power to do anything about this for the last 30 plus years.
Is there a way to make prosecuting WS crooks profitable?
Also start prosecuting the police officers who don’t do their jobs and cover up there mistakes. #uvalde
What about the crooks in DC buddy boy.

Hey /u/Defiant_Race_7544,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
“Things that will never happen for $1000, Alec”
100% agree... but he isn't going to do anything about it
It's such an easy line...

When would it ever happen?
1st time I’ve ever agreed with Sanders.
Whoa whoooaaa whoooaaa. Then how would cops pay for thems fancy parking lot swat costumes?
Not gonna happen.
Lol actually do something useful? I don't think that's why people get into government
Ah yeas, fight for us until it’s time to run for election and then sell the fuck out and leave us hanging.
A-freaking-men.
But the JOBS those crooks on wallstreet MIGHT make!!!!!!!
It's pretty great how Bernie has united people in this country.  Forget Alex Jones, Bernie has been right all along.  No cell no sell.  ✊
Public says to Sanders, ""Show up for the damn votes so we stop losing rights like privacy.""
Life wold be much simpler if we just legalize weed at this point there's no reason to keep it illegal other then to help rich assholes get richer and frankly I don't give two shits about the rich pricks of this country
Does Sanders know the type of people he works with?

Might as well ask them to give up sex trafficking
Lmao, never going to happen since they're all owned by banks/hedge funds/financial terrorist
Since when do  I   have account ? Are here questions about  windows media  whit vista and questions about  the  hardware and the   mmemory card and     harddrive? of so what date is it?
Weed weed weed weed weed weed weed.

Can reddit find anything to talk about besides weed? We get it. You're drug addicts. But yOuR dRuG iS dIfFeReNt!

Christ, potheads are eternally annoying.
Dammit Bernie stop making us look stupid!
What if your drug dealers work on Wall Street?
For sure...but don't ignore ""broken windows"" - it's a proven model of policing.
Damn straight!
Fluff political pieces on /r/economy?

Must be midterms lmao

Karma is inflated as fuck lmao. 16k and top of /r/all, but top comment has 160 karma. What a joke.
Sounds good
he’s not wrong
based
Bernie is kind of a fuckin moron but I agree with him on this one
Oh ok so stop targeting poor people and start targeting rich people… let’s see how that goes
How do u all not see it? Its easy to bust someone on pot, u get to cosplay a real tuff guy and bust down their doors cuz u know damn well all thats behind that door are some stoners munching on some spicy Cheetos. Whats not easy is trying to do this to a bunch of coke lords. Its really strange how they pick and choose the easy jobs and then brag themselves up and say they are protecting the community. BS u just lined up the funds for the next BBQ.
What a controversial post.
Duh
Oh I was looking for economics
I’d love to party with the Granny in the pic. Seems like she’s fun at parties.
Suddenly the right supports weed
It’s easier to fill the privately owned prisons with drug offenders.
How the fuck would that get our license plates and candles made by slave labour? Them dudes are too good at staying free. We like cost effective options here in the dept of justice
Or do both. They're different agencies handling these crimes (typically local handles drugs, state/federal handle financial)
Duh thanks
HELL YEAH
🏴🕊🌱🦾
Lets start with the crooks in the gov't first.
There is a percentage of people claiming to be on the left that were okay with the DNC, establishment democrats, and establishment republicans doing everything possible to prevent this man from being the nominee
[deleted]
To Bernie, any profit is evil and needs to go to the government.
Who would be in a position to so something about those drug laws? I wonder
tbh i'd rather them clean house get get all the corrupt and law breaking cops off the street and in jail where they belong, we would be a lot safer if they cleaned up the police departments first. having even 10% of the force as murders and criminals is very bad that should be proirity over wall street.
Steady on Bernie! That sounds like common sense. Too close to commonism for some people.
Asking the government to punish themselves. I'm sure it'll happen
I like the guy but hes been saying this for like 50 years and nothing ever changes
Says that while being one of the crooks on wall street
Legalization still results in people getting locked up. Cannabis should be treated like any other crop. There’s no limit to how many tomatoes you can grow.
Start with Nancy Pelosi for insider trading.
Even in red states getting caught with marijuana is a slap on the wrist (assuming you have no priors).
Yeah... people (even some politicians) have been saying this for decades.
I thought this said Sandler for way too long😂
That's our only sane career politician Bernie Sanders!
FUCKING PLEASE
eventually half of this might occur
Cops don't work for the people they work for the wall street crooks how does he not know this.
What if we meet in the middle? All world leaders from this point forward are required to regularly smoke weed to curb their aggressive tendencies.
He need look no further than his congressional colleagues to crack down on Wall St. Do it Bernie.
I really do think that if Bernie somehow became president, he'd end up being ""suicided.""
His ideas on the Joe Rogan Experience for taxing high frequency trading as a means for paying for college debt and making college free in America was just absolutely brilliant.
Bernie sanders for president
> Prosecuting Crooks on Wall Street
  
I know Bernie is serious and I admire his tenacity at 'sticking to his guns'/messaging line, but seriously 'get real'. Its NEVER gonna happen.
Prosecute crooked January 6th Politicians!!!  Not just the regular people!!!
Let's have more politicians that were born in the 70s & 80s.
Why doesnt Sanders push to allocate funds for more regulators and FBI to patrol Wall street  instead of running his tired old lips to gain political likes.
Wrong wingers have been so polarized and blinded to hate the government, they do not see how much they get ripped off by corporations… a truly neutral person sees both as needing regulation, but imo the profit motive makes many more people corrupt than working in the public sector.

We need Wall Street(people willing to risk their money to invest in good ideas - and companies) , but it needs to be properly and effectively regulated.
How about busting politicians that make $174.000 per year and have a net worth of over 135 million
The political parties running congress are all multi millionaires or more who couldnt care less about any of our interests.   
Take what you want, people. Do what you want, and fuck the rules, invented by rich to prevent you from LIVING.    
  
And even still it’s hard. We must unite and destroy the rich. And get high
This is where I really think Bernie Sanders is full of crap. Here's a guy who's in government and could actually make some laws and rules to rein in some of the reckless decisions made on Wall Street and he's not doing it.  You want to make Wall Street Fair for the average investor you need to get rid of the things that give the big guys the advantage. Number one trading after hours  the big guys can do it much longer than the average Joe can. And then there's dark pools we're trading is done completely off the books between large investment companies that should be eliminated.  I'm sorry all trading should be done 9:30 to 4:00 like everyone else. But is Bernie or any of the other Democrats or Republicans bringing up these points no they're not because they're all in the pockets of Wall Street.
Even Common Dreams?

Cannabis story - nasty joint.

Alcohol story - evening gowns and wine glasses.

Everywhere!
Bernie is literally the most cleanest politician of all time. Mans have been consistent for 70 plus years. I’m talking about him being the only politician that joined MLK’s protest and got arrested for it, while most dems his age either sided with the popular public opinion at the time or remained centrist.

We’ll never see a politician like him in our lifetime.
It always back fires on the muppets.
He's been saying this since the 20's
I love when Bernie says the word Crook
Man I can't believe the GOP is blaming marijuana for all the mass shootings not the bloody gun's. What's wrong with this picture???
News at 11
But wall street people are the ones funding them, why would the arrest them when they can arrest people using cannabis instead.
Busting people for marijuana is pretty damn stupid anyways when cigarettes are apparently fine but marijuana isn't.
Crime is the secret ingredient
He of course didn't bother naming any names for prosecution or name the crimes they committed because the simpletons that listen to him assume that everybody is guilty of a crime and if they aren't they should write a law that makes them guilty of one.
 AMEN!
*ape noise*
Senators complaining about ""wall street"" is the lowest effort sleight of hand ever.  


Not only does the federal government have nearly limitless resources and the ABILITY to prosecute high level financial crimes if they really wanted to crack down on it...a giant chunk of federal spending IS all these regulatory offices that end up going after grandpa because he underpaid his taxes by 700 bucks.  Meanwhile, Bernie Madoff basically had to turn himself in before they figured it out.  Despite people trying to turn him in, with reason, multiple times beforehand.  


...but these senators who have been in office since the 1980s are also the ones who MADE the current system.   Not fooling anyone.
Hey I think we should stop killing people and start loving people. I know pretty crazy opinion but that’s just what I think
Bernie Sanders is a crook too
How are they going to arrest themselves if they own the systematic unhinged law system they created to hurt us.  Who do we call upon if this whole crooked entity is connected is some sick way to only benefit these psychopaths on Wall Street, politicians and corrupt government officials Media Web they took over everything to oppress us.  These people been stole our democracy COVID-19 show these criminals for who they really are systematic psychopaths unhinged racist greedy corrupted idiots that has no respect for humanity…….
Are the Abbott formula execs in jail yet ?
Bernie's right, again.
Expose wallstreet!!! Wallstreet loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do. Or even better, for you to just leave them the fuck alone. 

Well some people are starting to look….what they are finding is the most corrupt manipulated financial system that may ever exist. Bring them down and bring your freedom back!
It’s

The

Economy 

Stupid!
I am a Sanders and I approve this message.
Maybe star with people killing each other in Chicago? I believe that's a bigger priority than Wall St.
in America? PFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
He's not wrong.
do both?
Anyone else sick of all the attention every time famous people make obvious statements. If anyone is surprised by that statement then they are the problem.
He meant in Maralago...
Why not bust criminals in Congress?
Old hippie says old hippie shit isn't headline news.
Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Though, the conservatives manage to even fail to do *that* much.
How about the crooks in congress i.e Nancy Pelosi? How exactly is she worth $111M as a 'public servant' (hint: insider trading & payoffs)
As an outsider I genuinely don’t get how Sanders has such a negative perception in the states.
In terms of return on investment, guillotines are fast, cheap, and reliable in terms of their ability to extract stolen assets from the ruling classes. Hypothetically, of course.
First part will hopefully eventually happen. Second part never will
Oh I thought he was going to say ""Start prosecuting criminals."" Here in California we haven't discovered that prosecuting criminals is a thing.
Do both.
Didnt he endorse fucking Hillary Clinton at the 2016 election?
Had me in the first half
Until grandpa starts saying names this is just blablabla
Ken Griffin
Who still gets arrested for weed? That's so 1990s.
He’s not wrong.   At all.
Me in New Jersey where that not a issue
But then they won't gey his money...
They can't lose out of money.
“No.” - the gov.
He is just virtue signaling at this point. No offense guys but it's the truth.
Because I’m 100% sure that’s exactly what he would of done.
I would say why don’t we start having some actual investigation into all politicians and how they make their money. They won’t, because then they’ll be nobody left to run the country.
Soooo go after bernie sanders as well?
Imagine if they were all of a sudden like “alright yeah let’s do it” and then they just did it? Nancy pelosi just holding out her hands to be cuffed along with 50% of others? Seems less likely then an inhabited Atlantis being discovered
So does this sub, that I thought was originally meant for economic policy discussion, just going to keeping posting these unnuanced takes that are r/all bait? At least the Bernie Bros and MAGA people are having a nice circlejerk in the comments. Horseshoe theory ftw
Bernie needs to start his own party
I started getting a bad sinus infection like I usually do every year. 1st time I had medical marijuana. I smoked that and not 2 days later, I'm 100% again. With over the counter, I'd usually struggle for a couple of weeks. Federally legalize marijuana, already.
something we can all agree on
According to the FBI two thirds of the crime committed in this country is of the white-collar variety so why aren't our prisons full of guys like Donald Trump and his spawn?
I entered the spez. I called out to try and find anybody. I was met with a wave of silence. I had never been here before but I knew the way to the nearest exit. I started to run. As I did, I looked to my right. I saw the door to a room, the handle was a big metal thing that seemed to jut out of the wall. The door looked old and rusted. I tried to open it and it wouldn't budge. I tried to pull the handle harder, but it wouldn't give. I tried to turn it clockwise and then anti-clockwise and then back to clockwise again but the handle didn't move. I heard a faint buzzing noise from the door, it almost sounded like a zap of electricity. I held onto the handle with all my might but nothing happened. I let go and ran to find the nearest exit.
I had thought I was in the clear but then I heard the noise again. It was similar to that of a taser but this time I was able to look back to see what was happening.
The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again. It was the same as before and it seemed to be coming from all around me. I put my hands on the floor and tried to move but couldn't.
I then heard another voice. It was quiet and soft but still loud.
""Help.""

\
Bernie has some great ideas but I seriously doubt his retirement portfolio is 100% controversy/conflict free. You can't make money, otherwise.
""A man who has never gone to school may steal from a freight car; but if he has a university education, he may steal the whole railroad.""

If you want an American Revolution, start punishing white-collar crimes ten-times as harshly as blue-collar ""crimes"".


Starting with Congress.
Local police should hire accountants and lawyers as officers and prosecute insider trading and other white collar crimes on the local level. Take it out of the federal court where they can call a congressman and get a free pass.
How many times I've seen this and no action being taken 🤷‍♀️
Yeah! Finally something good sanders says!
Ask Fox news and they'll tell ya marijuana is what causes mass shootings.
why not all those crooks in congress and the senate too
He's not wrong, but it'll never happen. They control everything.
He says a lot of demagogic things he just doesn’t do anything about it but run for president.
Preach Bernie
It's crazy how quickly the idea of being busted for marijuana became strange to me once it was legalized.
And politicians.
Finally something I can agree with!
It’s funny that this is even in the news section, like he’s been saying this for years is anyone surprised by this?
How about the crooks in D.C. who also protect the crooks on Wall Street?
Amen.
Not gonna make him any friends with the executive branch.
*sanders introduces no bills and does nothing*
Lol you’re joking right? 😂😂😂😂
To be fair he’s been saying this for a looooong time
How about prosecuting crooked politicians?  Lord knows there’s no shortage of them.
More of us than there are of them. That’s all I’ll say…
Go a step up and abolish the federal reserve and abolish fiat currency.
Does anyone know if in canada or the states the president or prince Minister has the ability to put in laws with anyone stopping them? 

The only good thing about the stock market being unreasonable right now is knowing that there's a large chunk of everyday people who have put money into it and this has helped stop wall street from being the only people who control the market. 

Right now alot of these wall street clowns are looking at valuation and having a hard time justifying buying some stocks again but the last 2 years they sold alot hoping that they would cash out and buy at the bottom.
he’s *been* saying this
He makes so much sense it blows people's mind it's really that simple. We have been inundated w/ lies for so long few of us can independently think for ourselves.

Legalize weed. Go after the real criminals in Murica that work on Wall St. If there were lobbyists for retail, this would have already been done but since our Congress belongs to the highest bidder, here we are.

The US used to be the beacon for the world. Now we just incarcerate ourselves at the highest rate and lead in mass shootings. What a shit show this country has become.

It's sad, really. That we allowed this to happen. Sad indeed.
he’s the biggest con crook of them all, he lied of his finances for the first 5 years when he formed Berkshire. His insurance companies he bought he used lines of credit with fraudulent finance statements provided to banks
You would need to build more prison camps
I am so sick and tired of hearing about Bernie Sanders ancient comments.
The American people elected politicians who pass laws to criminalize marijuana and black people. They didnt elect politicians to lock up the people robbing them on Wall Street. Bernie Sanders is an anomaly from hyper liberal Vermont.
Fuck the DNC for continuing to railroad Sanders, he should be in the middle of his second presidential term by now.
I'm glad this new young senator is TALKING about things that the people want. I'm eager to see how his career plays out in the long run. I know he will actually be a driving force for change and will not buckle to the lucrative pressures of D.C.
Colonel Sanders always had a knack for trying to fit in, he must have some skeletons for sure…
One involves a local municipal officer paid for by city taxes. The other would be the jurisdiction of a federal agency like the SEC or, perhaps, NY state. 

Some sheriff’s department in eastern Oregon can’t exactly start arresting executives at JP Morgan. 

The administration, funding, leadership, and governing authority are entirely different. 

There is literally no one in the entire country who oversees both who could switch resources from one to the other. 

This is the kinda dumb shit that someone says to build a cult of personality amongst young idealists who don’t actually know how institutional structure affects governance.
Then he should put his money where his mouth is and do something about it. 

Sanders sure does drone on about crap that he has the power to attempt to fix so much that I’m starting to think that he’ll do nothing about it. I like his politics, but his lack of action is exhausting.
Keep talking Bernie, you’ve been saying the same thing for like 50 years, I’ll believe it when I see it.
Federal stance on weed alone is enough to let me know that everything is messed up within our government. There is absolutely no reason anyone should be in prison for non violent possession of a plant. Until that changes I will never concede that our government cares about being just.
Nah lets start with the bought and paid for politicians.
How about the crooks in our own government lmao. Most wallstreeters pay taxes. The bosses/owners dont and they are in bed with our corrupt government
Why not both ? Why not wype out all evil from earth?
Populist gonna populist.
If only they cared about the people instead of money
100% agree w this
Hell no. At least the Wall Street types are useful. Pot smokers are not

Old man yells at clouds
Wow he's so enlightened
Who? Sanders? Who’s that?
Amen.
The crooks on Wallstreet are working with the crooks in our political parties, that ain't never going to happen.
Conservative, and I can DEFINITELY get behind that.
Sanders should move to Russia.
Is he running for pres again to concede the votes to the mainstream dem?
Nah. Lets start with the crooks in politics no matter what party.
Bernie would wind up in prison then. All of DC is part of all that
Farewell Reddit. I have left to greener pastures and taken my comments with me. I encourage you to follow suit and join one the current Reddit replacements discussed over at r/RedditAlternatives

Reddit used to embody the ideals of free speech and open discussion, but in recent years has become a cesspool of power-tripping mods and greedy admins. So long, and thanks for all the fish.
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave
They'll pay their way out
Imagine...
But if they stop incarcerating people for basic misdemeanors then how will they be able to lease the slav… I mean prisoners, out to farms for forced labor?
Get over to r/superstonk people and learn how GameStop is the lynchpin in the house of cards known as the “free market.” The Wall Street goons have been riding a crime wave for decades. The SEC, which is also corrupt, hates the derogatorily named “meme stock” community so much it has made an exception to its rule of being a fair and unbiased “regulatory” body that it’s making propaganda videos to persuade retail buyers to stay away from the ONLY stocks they know they have lost control over.
Is Bernie Sanders the last honest politician? Seriously this man is awesome and has been fighting the good fight for 30 years. Let's elect him president already.
What are the ""crooks on wall street"" doing, exactly, that he thinks is against the law?

The laws he helped write, and could change if he wanted to?
Yep
God damn I want that man to be my president.
The poor guy has had an unwavering conviction of the same ideals since he was young and looking around it seemed like rarely anyone has taken notice, even after all the ""feel the bern"" craze.
Well I think the Colonel has a horse in this race, or should I say chicken.
Reddit moment

Literally 'bro just legalize weed and we empty all prisons easy as'  not that most offenders are in for violent crimes or that we still need to rehabilitate them and that their is a 100 more issues with prisons and the second part of just eat the rich, like who what why?  This has no links to an economics (literally it more focuses on problems of drug enforcement and such what does crime have to do with economics)  and just a lame karmawhore post.  I guess the go after white collar criminals and such is, um capitalism related?  but really this post has nothing to do with economics.
Legit! They are easy to catch - follow the money!
I'm really feeling the Bern on this one
Maybe he should work for once in his life and write a bill?
Bro what
Thanks Bernie. How about you do something that counts instead of this stupid lip service. Bernie’s has sold out anyone that was ever excited about him.

Bernie voice *”I like those crooks on Wall Street, they are ahhhh very good friends of mine”*
Agreed! Stop voting Republican and get the conservative mindset off your ass if you're tired of being exploited by corporations and wall street! They are not your friends and never will be!

If you're a minority or immigrant of sorts and you think wealthy people give a shit about you or you think you will become like the 1% by voting and supporting shitty conservative policies, you're wrong.
I agree with him. I also think we should prosecute him too (as well as all other congresspeople) for voting for attacking Libya, bombing Yugoslavia,  and countless other imperialist efforts. Imagine if we cleaned out both Washington and Wall Street at the same time? Heaven.
I just find it hilarious that this cliche has 32,000 votes in 2 hours.  The bots are out in full force
Buy GME if you want to see Wall Street in trouble.
Yo, this is the answer right here. For one taxes on Marijuana profits have helped fund schooling and education while Wall Street has stolen 401K's and favored plans to rig market against retail traders.  Get fucked you yuppy wall street scum!
Whole lot of 'Sanders Says' instead of 'Sanders Passes Bill That Does' on Reddit.  People have been saying this kind of stuff for a long time, but until they actually garner enough support in Congress to get it done, it's just hollow rhetoric.
The same Sanders who trashed our economy with Bidenflation? He’s guaranteed the Republicans crush it in the midterms.
And rich politicians! That’s you too burny
Controlled opposition
He right
This is what passes for economic content on here? Lame one liners
Bernie has all the good ideas.
Can we add insurance companies to the list? Holy fuck they are squeezing any and all profit out of my small business as if they actually do anything to earn it.
Which one of his houses was the rich socialist in when he said this?
Bernie Sanders the only based senator.
Eat the rich
Or just prosecute anyone breaking the law? This isn't a class fight FFS.
for once bernie and I agree
He's too based for this world
Start with the crooks in Congress
Maybe we should also go after the crooks in Washington DC too?

&#x200B;

We can't do anything about Wallstreet if the guys we have to rely on to do so are part of the problem.
I don’t often agree with Bernie Sanders but he is right about this.
Crooked politicians would be also good to start busting.
If we dont do anything about the stolen election, the rest is moot.
and in government?  https://www.interstitialcystitisinindia.org/jen-psaki-net-worth-27-million-forbes-2022-salary-white-house-press-secretary-icin
Sanders has also dropped out of every single candidacy after being paid off
He SEC is a compliant criminal organization. We need to put a stop to all this corruption as soon as possible.
Sanders.  Living in his own world.  


I wish that he'd just call himself a marxist and just get it out there.
I would have liked the timeline where he was president. The results wouldn't have been much different than biden since he wouldn't have had the power of the Congress, but Biden is too quiet and reserved for these times.
This is the type of narrative that radicalized America.  ""Drugs are good and the rich are bad"". "" Authority is broken and you are right to be angry"".  
Why can't we fight the war on drugs and prosecute illegal activities on Wall Street at the same time?   Also I am sure most people in finance obey the laws and earn an honest living. They shouldn't be demonized.
People like Sanders should not be taken seriously.  People like Joe Rogan shouldn't be taken seriously.  Both are opportunist that seek their own interest by radicalizing our society.
Just decriminalize it already 🙉
He always says such good things until the rest of the politicians mess it up
Bernie the Millionaire
Sanders is an idiot and probably has done enough crack to kill every brain cell he wanted to have in the first place (not that he ever had many to begin with but he has been destroying brain cells on credit).
I don’t think the crooks on wallstreet would prosecute themselves.
“Old man yells at cloud”

This isn’t news it’s just Bernie on a weekday
...says the millionaire.
I love when rightwingers say how they hate the ""progressive movement"" when it's literally 1 guy, and he's the only one with good ideas.
Then who will fund congress members ~~reelections~~?
Sanders is an idiot … just saying bs shit …
Waaa rich people bad, drugs good, vote for me!
and to that i say *in best richard nixon voice* “i am not a crook”
Why not bust both?
Frankly, if dealers were to form a lobby and donate to political campaigns you'd see a change in how they're treated in the courts.
Go to r/superstonk for more information on wall street corruption
Agreed. Laws with fines are just a tax on the poor and acceptable expenses to the rich.
Isnt sanders the dude that made millions while in office. By making deals woth wall street crooks
Ok, but what is a crook on wall street? Bernie makes the law. Legalize drugs.  That's on you Bernie. 

What law is being broken on wall street? Or what legal activity on wall street do you want to criminalize?
How about not complaining to help get Lockheed execs paid
But rich people can fight back and poor people can not.  Doesn't seem economically feasible.
People want the insiders to investigate and prosecute the insiders

I'm here for it but how do you ask the people in power to go after the people in power?

Did Plato address this?
I agree
HERE'S HOW BERNIE CAN STILL WIN

RICH MAN BAD!

WEED GOOD!
Sanders starting to be based again, nice. This time don't fuck it up lol, we don't need no more empty promises
Nice sentiment. Impossible in the current American culture to implement.
Please, Mr Sanders; have you no understanding of nor respect for, the established US status quo?! It all hinges on hurting the little people as much and as hard as you can, while letting the big crooks; the 1%ers, go free whatever they do! It's how the system not only works, but must continue to work; for the greater good of the 1%!!!

Vulture capitalism depends on having a large pool of miserably poor people to be exploited at will by the corporations. That pool of people must be willing to work for starvation wages and above all, they must be *able* to work. So, no drugs which make people mellow. Alcohol-fueled street-fights? Perfect! People sitting around talking about the world for hours while munching on home-made brownies? No, must be outlawed!! 

Now, Mr Sanders; surely you saw that the Democrat establishment want nothing to do with you, right? Hell, they chose the Faux-Republican, neo-liberal austerity-loving wife of one of the most labor-destructive presidents *ever* over you! Well, the goose-stepping, clown-car driving brown-shirts like you even less, so why don't you just go home and rail at the TV, m'kay?

America doesn't need you or your Commie-talk! Wall Street is what makes the country work, m'kay? That and the Military Industrial Complex, m'kay? 

Why don't you just move to Scandinavia, where happy Socialists live!?!
Yeah no shit, pretty sure he's said that for like 40 years.
This is not a political statement but...Bernie Sanders is pretty rad
Hahahah oh so fucking rich. Tell that to our VP who put more blacks away for small marijuana crimes than any prosecutor in her state. Oh we don’t talk about that right because she’s part of the “good guys”.

Yeah fuck off
“Bernie is a socialist”
That’s the opposite of corruption so expect him to be further marginalized for this
Can we bust wall street crooks for marijuana?
How about busting the crooks that become millionaires in government….like him
I’d vote for this man in every election and I don’t smoke. Shame my generation (millennials) couldn’t make this happen.
Old man yells at cloud
Same thing he's been rightfully saying for decades but even Reddit has stopped listening and started listening to the establishment.
What about the corrupt politicians?
You're in power...go get them.
Lol /r/economy
But the people that smoke weed usually don't fight back.
Based Bernie
Just do the first part FFS
Yes!  And politicians too!!  And son’s of politicians who made millions peddling influence!!
Who is getting busted for marijuana these days?? It's basically legal everywhere.
Bust the crooked politicians and their children!!!
Ya know I usually don’t agree at all with Bernie but this one right here is good
At what point do we give up and declare war on the conservatives?
My elderly parent’s tax person fucked up on a form and the government has been hounding my parents for 4 years over $600 they don’t even owe, and recently communicated they’ve been accruing fees daily the entire time.

No support, no help, different information and run around every time. 

They’ve gone to the offices, they’ve sent letters, they’ve talked to people on the phone for hours and every time it’s a different story and they can’t resolve it.

I don’t even have to add a meanwhile, you know what I’m getting at.
There may (?) be some crooks in our government also that needs prosecuting!
Now THERE'S a novel idea...
So in other words, ol' Bernie hasn't changed a bit lol
Put every politician who owns more than one house in prison for life.
EXACTLY
My marijuanna use has never caused:

A national recession

A formula shortage

Gas prices; generally

Inflation

Medical Bankruptcies

Or the deaths of my loved ones at the hands of a deranged lunatic

Maybe if congress smoked a bowl they'd chill the fuck out and do their job correctly.
Saying some shit isn’t a policy - same dude who now votes lockstep with the other Republican Party
""I will change everything for the good!"" promised the millionth political for the millionth time.
How about is wife earning millions from his presidential campaigns?

Bernie is the biggest let down and sell out
Agree with that take, but why is this on the front page. He says this two times every day and then once before dinner.
And in Washington…
“But crooks on Wall Street can afford lawyers!” -District Attorneys every where
See this is annoying because we all know what needs to be done but NOTHING ever will. Presidents lie and the senate are all stuck in the past timers!!!
The police work for them, so good luck with that.

The only thing to bring justice is a good old fashion French style revolution.
Bernie: waaaah, stop jailing my deadbeat supporters, waaaah
Finally something everyone can agree with!
Selective policing is our heritage though.
#Say it louder for the Mungers in the back!
Yeah but....that would reflect a government for the people...
""But Bernie, rich people can afford lawyers! How else would we maintain our influx of new ~~slaves~~ prison laborers to keep building shitty Walmart furniture and/or guns for the war machine?""
just think of what needs to happen for *anything* to get better
Start with the shorters!! “Off with their heads!!!”
Nah that’s too hard lol 😂
Facts!!!
Sanders needs to stop saying shit and start doing shit.  So fucking tired of spineless lip service.
He’s not wrong… people shouldn’t want to be politicians for life. It should be an obligation, a duty, an honor, not a dang lifetime of grift…
bUT tHaT's cOmMUnISm
Legalize oxys too pussiez
anything and everything crooked in this world seems to stem from that shithole chicago i swear..
I'm sick of politicians telling other politicians to do something rather than doing it themselves
You mean the same ones that funded him 
Wink wink 
We are not stupid.  Like a “pro” wrestling match where republicans and democrats slug it out and people (tax payers) pay money to see the show where “opponents” mingle like BFF after fake show. A really good gig if you can get it, only requirement is being totally morally bankrupt and a sociopath. The people that religiously believe in these people boggles my mind
SEC is a joke literally just put out a video making fun of new investors to a certain degree that we fucking paid for
Nice . this could get us a LOT of time , lol
Start with the Pelosi family
Sanders also voted to send $50 + billion in US taxpayer money to nazis in Ukraine trying to start WW3. Zero credibility.
gme baby... get fucked you crooks (the gme people are the crooks)
Love that man ✌🏻
In this chapter of “America is a dystopia that is never going to change and will be the death of the planet.”
How about politicians too? They have been robbing us through  the hidden tax that is inflation for decades.
just as well ask a beggar to keep his hands in his pockets. they're not gonna willingly let that cash cow walk away
And!!!! We should look into that Burlington College Land Deal!!!  And January 6th, and the Hunter Biden influence deals and the illegal wiretapping of candidate Trump and Trump too.  Actually, that doesn’t make Wall Street look too bad by comparison.
Including him!! Lifetime POC millionaire on our dime!!!
Why not both? We have laws we should either use them or get them off the books.
Gas prices reach 8-10 dollars, impacting people's ability to afford COL and whether or not working is even profitable

Skyrocketing food prices, due to above and the war and climate change.

Wage suppression means people can't even keep with these price hikes

Roe V Wade decision is finalized

Mass shootings continue to accelerate in frequency and severity

Above two cause protests, which are violently suppressed, and may ironically attract a mass shooter as well

Heat waves globally and nationwide, accompanied by
Rolling blackouts and skyrocketing cost for AC

No action from Congress other than arms dealing

Uvalde sets clear example that the police are illegitimate

Police continue to merrily oppress the populace, another bad shoot is caught on tape, and crackdowns on protests also provide fodder for anti-police sentiment

Monkeypox continues to spread and becomes a pandemic itself, COVID continues to ravage the country, no federal response to either

It's gonna be a rough year for sure. Rest assured though, that nothing about this system will fundamentally change

and this is the best-case version of where we’re heading. it’s gonna be dumber and bloodier in new and unexpected ways
This is the way.
Lock em up
Same Sanders with 3 houses, millions of dollars, all gained somehow on a senators salary?
Wow, so wise.  What is he 12?
SEC is busy watching porn instead of doing their job. Gary Gensler has Ken Griffin’s so far down his throat it’s unsettling
Of course he did 😆
Lol you didn't need to put ""Sanders says..."" we can all tell its him saying this
Sanders says ""When you're white you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto, you don't know what it's like to be poor... We will end institutional racism.""

Irony is lost on him.
Bernie Sanders is a part of the problem. Always speaking up about this shit but not when it matters.
How about throwing some FBI, ATF, ICE and US marshals resources at criminals who commit crimes using firearms? I do agree with Sanders that financial criminals should also be prosecuted.
star prosecuting corrupt politicians like Sanders
They will never do anything. As far as am concerned, but once a different set of people take over they will start doing something about it. Corruption in America is a shame and a pity. Its obviously full is lies from top to bottom
Arrest politicians on the take (well all of them).
Will the Supreme Court the BernieBros built even allow these prosecutions?
Dam right
I think fraud stop be legal in America so we can all do it and get 100 dollar fine over a 10 trillion dollars fraud.
There could be a compromise, just bust the crooks on Wall Street for marijuana.  I know, the crooks have their lawyers on speed-dial and would be out before they got to the station.  But it is a start.
We should prosecute crooks on Capitol Hill first and foremost.
You know what your taxation needs? More taxation. That'll fix it.
Reason this guy will never president coz those crooks know he will bust them!
These are the kind of statements that are going to get this man elected.
Also stop blaming shootings on marijuana
Bernie definitely hodls some gme
Can Sanders replace Biden please?
That my friend is Kenny g
Bernie is a crook on Wallstreet lol
Start with the crooks in the US Senate.
It shouldn’t be hard. They definitely also have drugs.
*BREAKING: Senator Sanders says the same thing he's said every day since 1964* 

/s just in case
Fentanyl for the win
Where do they still 'bust people for Marijuana'?

Other than dealers of large amounts. Most of the US has decriminalized or has  cite and release policy in place.
That's my motha fucking boy Bernie. Fuck wall street fucking all of us and our pensions.  Our generation doesn't know the possibility of retirement because of these fucks.
He’s a fucking senator he has the power to do that. Instead of just saying it why doesn’t he do it.
I don't smoke weed, and I generally don't agree with much of what this guy says. But, I do on this point. However, it's just rhetoric. He's in someone's pocket, that's for damned sure, but it is a good talking point.
Bernie Sanders is an absolute joke. No one should be falling for him anymore. He's a DNC sheepdog/cuck. His job is to sheepherd people into a pro war, pro corporate, etc party. I'm not falling for him anymore, he's a total fraud. He says all the right things, but then he goes and fights for absolutely nothing. If you want to see what a chump he is. Go look at his vote for the NATO bombing of Kosovo. Please don't fall for him and his BS anymore.
About that Wall Street part… that will become especially true sooner than later.
The Pope says “I am a Catholic”.

Yeet
Didn't he hear that gun violence went up after marijuana began to be legalized? At least that's what Fox news is trying to push
well when crooks on wall street are the same people in politics there isn't anyone to prosecute them.
So fox news is telling me that studies have shown marijuana is linked to violent psychosis,  but i had already had some pot brownies and even though I'm eating the best slice of apple pie and ice cream the only anger I'm feeling is because of how shitty it is to call yourself Fox News and not once show any cute foxes. It's been an hour of the donkey faced blonde women yell at me and some guy named Tucker Carlson looking confused. Ever wonder what the fox says my dudes? It says lies.
Appealing to cops to stop busting people for weed ? Parents asking to help their dying children didn't work so what the hell will this do.
Fuck, I wish this man was able to become president
Not sure if it's been posted yet, but here's this.

Bernie might be one of my favorite broken clocks.
Do both. clean up the streets, clean up the homes, and clean up the government.
Biden could just end all this with the swipe of a pen, but he won’t lmao
Never going to happen. Too much money is given to these fucking politicians
Let’s get those pieces of shit that looted also I’m with him
Member when there was talk about not allowing sitting politicians to own stock because its basically just insider trading and then nothing happened? People in power are some of these crooks on wall st.
neither of those things will happen.
As a 36 year old I feel unsure of a lot of new lingo but I feel “based” is appropriate here
How is that ""vote blue no matter who"" bullshit working out?
If only there was someone Bernie could talk directly to about this
Can we maybe not go after wall street for a couple years? Give my shares some time to recover from this recession first please. I'm all for holding these people accountable but I would also like to retire before I die.
The crooks in government can’t even pass a bill to stop politicians from doing insider trading. What makes you think that they will have their rich supporters arrested. For gods sakes man, you can’t pass responsible gun ownership legislation due to payoffs, I mean contributions, from the NRA.
Remember when idiots said Sanders is too old and feeble to be president? Same assholes voted for that relic Biden. They guy who can’t from words due to how senile he is.
Right? Are we still living in Nixons American or what?
People are still being busted for marijuana?
I know this sounds good in theory. But crooks on wall street have very very good lawyers and can drag things out for years or even get cases dismissed. Most pot users can afford anything over a public defendant.
Old man yells at cloud
Oh finally we have a politician that makes sense.

Cool, he’s said this for a while now and nothing has happened.
Sanders says something to help him get voters.. 

The street cops aren't the ones who go after financial crimes
That would take out our entire government though, who would scam us and put us against each other?
Funny coming from a guy who has millions despite having no career.
Hehe he said the thing
Whens that crooks time in front of judge coming?
ken griffin lied under oath
Finally he said it!
If only Bernie had some sort of power to change the laws.  Alas, all he does is talk
Busting people for marijuana at this point is wasting valuable police resources on something that is not worthwhile
Ken griffin took teachers pensions away and blamed it on retail traders. He fucked the system and blamed us. He deserves to rot.
He says this while actively promoting legislation that would make people felons for putting $2 pistol grips on their rifles.
He always says this
That’s very anti-semitic, Bernie!
For real tho stop nickel and diming your police station and go for those big bust on Wall street.
He’s not wrong
Man.

I think someone needs to get Mr Sanders some oven mits for that hot take
This is barely economics-related. And it's from CommonDreams, which is just the propaganda wing of Bernie's dead campaign.
Just don't get hit on face just before election. The ""ring"" mark on face is telling what's happening in the Democrat party.
Lmao the irony of an economic subreddit being astro turfed by socialists
Okay, but then who is gonna get the Marijuana to the people? :) :)
I think the two are in order.  And I'll take some downvotes for that.
Prosecuting his thief multi millionaire wife would be nice
Omg what a hot take
You do realize they realize the crooks are holding this giant ball of fraud together, right?  Like the whole system will implode if they actually followed the law.
How to get upvotes on reddit
Should prosecute the crooks that sent 40b to Ukraine
Incredibly brave.
Wow real hard body sanders is… I would think this sincere if he weren’t a career politician. What a sell out.
Them: ""...But we're the crooks on wall Street! D:""
Can Sanders replace Biden? Only in my dreams
I’ll never understand why this man can’t get votes. Literally everything he says is damn near gospel to me.
Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post!

Yeah right man, they'll get right on that.
I love himb. .
Steal $100 and you’ll go to jail. Steal $100 million and the prosecutor will offer you a sweet deal, the judge will sentence you to probation, and the President will issue you a pardon.
One needs a cop to find an object in a person. The other needs many accountants, lots of evidence and really well trained law enforcement and lawyers.
Lol yeah and also please get me surgery please. 🤕
This sounds like a John Mulaney quote for when he does his old timey bowler hat handle bar mustache white man impression
Berrnie is just rattling his sword He knows that the money peoplewill not ptosecute themselves.
Idk man. I saw on Fox News AND heard it from Doug Mastriano (Republican politician in PA) that weed causes school shooters.  /s

Edit: Sarcastic about the idk man. Those ppl are actually saying that
Why haven't they made it legal at federal level yet? It is long overdue and clearly something most citizens approve of.
When incriminating the crooks on Wall Street would also incriminate those making the laws don't hold your breath
Could throw Bezos in jail just for funsies.
Legalize it and give us healthcare! Can I run for office now?
Or ya know. Just fight normal crime.
This just made me realize how laws only exist for poor POC lmfao. If you doing illegal shit to get money and you’re white they don’t give a fuck.
Nancy Pelosi is gonna have him killed lol
Where my apes at?

-Stay Zen
deal weed 50 years, steal 3 billion 1 year.... FUCK ALL OF YOUR LAWS
good luck sanders

:(
Who's busting people for marijuana?!?
Congress gets a pass to do insider trading. Me and you go to jail for insider trading. Martha Stewart went to jail for insider trading. Yeah, it’s broken.
why would someone spend millions of dollars trying to convince children that marijuana turns you into a terrorist if it weren't true? No one could be that misanthropic unless they were doing an elaborate swift move.
Start with the Republicans and Democrats in Congress committing insider trading and becoming rich.
I'm gonna have to give this topic a Ric Flair wooooooo!
Sometimes I wonder if Bernie would’ve made a difference
Would be a more efficient allocation of resources
Good luck with that lol. Citigroup selected Obama's cabinet. 

The banks control America. I guess in the left there is the only opposition that could ever really threaten the banks but they get sidetracked by the gender marxism bullshit instead of focusing on class warfare between the bankers and the debt slaves.

And at the same time the left is trying to bad guns too. So nothing will change. I was part of the anti-bank movement many many years ago until I figured out that it would never change and joined the dark side. The left means well but they're too stupid, self-destructive and conflicted to commit to anything that actually works.
That makes way too much sense.

Like a lot of stuff he says. Let's just dismiss it, call him an ""unrealistic dreamer"", and vote for some terrible status quo democrat instead.
Amen to that. Old habits are hard to beak
No, lets prosecute both; both are illegal.
I don’t disagree but how is this news? He has been saying this for a decade now
I'll listen when he calls for the abolishment of the senate. Til then he can fuck himself with all his money and so called ""anger"".
This does include Elon
Prosecutions for weed aren’t on the top 20 list of things to solve. It’s begins with massive amounts of debt, inflation, foreign wars we have no business in, a massive increase in violent crime and murder, a wide open border, 100s of thousands of deaths from fentanyl and the list goes on. Tackle the big ones then maybe we can discuss things like this.
#once again, Bernie speaking facts
Start with Kenneth Griffin of Citadel. Lies under oath and runs a multi billion dollar scam stealing from innocent people… then blames it on you and retail investors.
Unfortunately feel the Bernie is just the crazy old man yelling at kids to get off his lawn at this point
Never going to happen.
Canada, we took care of the first problem.  Now how about that housing affordability crisis.
I really wish he would put forth a law that will do that because, you know, that's his Job
They didn’t.
Why can’t y’all just make him your president? A serious question.
Members of Congress and senators needs to be held accountable. Periodt
That would require cops with brains, an animal that simply doesn't exist.
Cool but words mean fuckin nothin
[That's what you voted for](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/09/11/kamala-harris-prosecuting-marijuana-cases/).

Yes please and thank you. - A new American Citizen
That’s a typical Sanders ignorant statement that sounds good but does nothing to advance our country
Okay but how would private prisons get free labor? And how would racist legislators manage to put away enough POC’s?
Pass a bill legalizing Marijuana you idiot Sanders.   What a friggin moron.

Or at least submit one you spineless coward
Politics friends wallstreets guys
Oh sorry Americans obviously don't want that. We elected Trump and Biden.
Maybe he should do something about that. Maybe start being a better negotiator with other congressmen?
The crooks on Wall Street have all of the power. The people smoking marijuana have almost none.

Well, except in the states where marijuana is legal.
I agree with his socialism views but I do agree with that. These people have been getting away with far too much for far too long.
i went to prison for two grams and ill never forgive everyone who pays taxes to these crooks. cannabis saved my life, i have mental health issues and cannabis made me normal again. i dont feel human though, i was treated worse than a livestock animal. literal torture in there. nobody even cares, im a human being but nobody cares i suffered for no reason. nobody cares and nobody will help me. americans will go to hell for torturing medicine users cause nobody cares and nobody will help us.
Look, i get why it happens, what i want to know is how you convinced a bunch of prison guards and policemen 'hey, we are going to give you a shit ton of work for barely any foreseeable profit'. Like for every 100 000 (probably more) small time pot busts, you could bust 1 wall street white collar criminal and make a lump profit. Less work, more profit.
What the hell is going on. 75% of Wall Street is constructed of “buy side” (buying public companies in hedge funds, mergers and acquisitions in investment banks, buying private companies in private equity, and investing in startups in venture capital). Literally all of those activities benefit all parties involved and have no negative externalities whatsoever. The sales and trading, which was obliterated due to policies, also are not run by “crooks”, it’s literally based upon the financial markets anyone can access.
Redditors nowadays rely on media catchphrases without understanding industries themselves.
I bet Bernie and progressives can’t even properly explain the role and function of the modern day financial sector
Could they fit more hard left politics into a headline? I consider myself liberal and even to me it’s crazy.
It's like popping your pimples when you have the plague. It feels good but it's... not really fixing anything.
Bernie thinks anyone not working for the government is a criminal. Hey Bernie, how’s that famous Russia trip working out for you?
I'm still waiting for them to bust politicians for insider trading and stealing US taxpayer money laundered through Ukraine. Bernie can get back to us when he addresses that issue.
How about we start with him and his beach front property in florida
Bernie should have won. America has Stockholm syndrome with shit representatives.
They are the crooks on Wall-street.
iT cOStS tOo MuCh /s
Bust people for both, or change the laws to make marijuana legal.
I feel like I have just as much pull in this administration as Bernie and I’ve said the same thing for years.

So…why is this on the front page?

Marijuana users will stop being “busted” when the motherfuckers he works along side of have a financial interest in it.

“Bernie says something popular with the majority of the country.  Nobody who can do anything about it gives a shit about his opinion”
How about punishing pedophile politicians?
But whom can you exploit to be your slaves then in the prison system?? Not enough WS crooks for that...
The sad thing, that won't happen the rich and the mega corporations own America guess who is in the pockets of most of the Wall Street fat cats politicians
Meanwhile the GOP is trying to blame gun violence on marijuana use…
In b4 prosecuting crooks in Wall Street would actually be bad for the economy.
Does sanders even matter? I know Reddit loves him but he doesn’t really accomplish anything. And when he ran no one went out to vote for him. I’m tired of the constant sanders and warren wank and then when they try to run everyone just doesn’t do shit all
It’s more crack and meth fueling gang activity that they’re after. This isn’t 1965
That's cause Sanders is one of the few who possesses brain cells in that country. Fuck imagine if he actually did win the presidency in 2016. This timeline wouldn't have been like it is now...
If you want to see how corrupt they are, head over to Superstonk. The research they've done on there is some of the most thorough and respected peer-reviewed research on wall Street corruption in human history.
Isn’t Sanders an American politician? Why doesn’t he do something about it instead of nagging the average citizen who has no power to do so?
Is anyone actually getting “busted for marijuana” in 2022. Seems like a 2005 campaign slogan.
Seems to be a lot of platitudes being espoused these days, people in authority saying, “oh I agree with you but my hands are tied.” It all goes back to who’s filling the coffers,
Maybe this guy should run for president. 🤔🙄😒
I think Bernie Sanders is getting senile.  He needs to be removed from office.
The difference is that one atleast makes the government a bit of money, while the other is mostly just a liability.

It doesn't matter of you like that or not, that is the main reason.
Says the guy representing the state where you still cant buy recreational cannabis in a store
What about the crooks in Washington, who steal our money on a daily basis ?
Well mr. Sanders, that would completely defeat the purpose of the whole criminal justice system if we did that!
We can do both, and while we are at it let’s look at how all these crooks in the house and senate use insider trader to get rich.
Lol if only tweeting things passed legislation. Guess someone gets to still work from home XD
Is this really noteworthy? ""Pro-legalisation socialist grandpa says something in line with his views"".
Follow my page for some exclusive photos and videos on demand. https://onlyfans.com/?ref=230684199
We should start with Congress, right?
There wouldn’t be any crooks of Wall Street if it not for crooks of K Street
It is to hard to take the wall ST’s stuff. In some states the cops can still bust you for pot and take everything away with asset forfeiture so they can sell it and buy cool shit.
Hah!  Yawl love your boogie-men doncha?  Just like the ""Economics is real"" that yawl 'believe'.  Economics is the lie told to the minions to get them to work harder and STFU.  What a wonderful world.
I can totally agree with that. The shame is, Bernie’s a DC insider trader talking out both sides of his ass in typical political fashion. You just can’t take old Carl Marx seriously.
Let's light up comrade Bernie !!!
Sanders is just another liberal cøcksucker who talks big but sat by decades as politicians policies carried out a war on drugs. Now he is saying all the right things just to get more funding from idiot liberals and do nothing to end the war on drugs.
 I've been saying the same thing for years. Cops are lazy and seek out the low hanging fruit to pad their stats and what's lower hanging than a stoner with a little weed on her/him?  
 I've seen it literally hundreds of times on COPS! Some poor schmuck is driving in a ""known drug neighborhood"", which is always in the black part of town, and that's all the excuse GangBlue needs to pull anyone over.
Looks like bernie has been playing Metal Gear Rising:Revengeance.
Meanwhile U.S. educated pot smokers are wondering why Bernie or anyone else keeps using the term for cannabis that was based on anti-Mexican racism?
Well hes not wrong
Economics
Too bad Bernie Sanders and his party dont have the power to make laws, then he could make laws instead of talking about making laws and blaming the other party for not passing them (when if his party didnt block them and do a little dance them they would pass)
Why not both?
Its funny because i've asked a number of people who use this rehtoric if they can give me an example of what they would want changed. All i get is vague and emotional responses.
How about they start ""Prosecuting the Crooks in the Government"" ?🤔 Alphabet agencies would be a good place to start.
Nah. Let's start with the crooks in Congress.
What a fresh take...

He's been saying this for many years and isn't alone.
Dude has been in office since before the GFC with multiple years of his party controlling the WH and Congress. Maybe actually holding his fellow party members accountable and calling them out by name would be a great start
And let the blacks get away with spending my taxes on drugs I don’t think so
Do I have to listen to headlines and sound bytes and fanboys promoting empty words from politicians that take absolutely no action for the rest of my life? ugh…
Ofc i agree w him but... the crooks on wall street are not gonna be prosecuted by local cops or the DEA. Youre gonna wanna talk to SEC for that, and they are corrupt and useless also. And even then, the hedgies can afford rich mans jail, rich mans lawyers and issue rich man bribes.
There’s too much money for policing among local PDs, DEA and various other alphabet agencies … and their unions … for this to happen.
Ah yes Sanders says yet another uncontriversal thing that everyone can agree with but does nothing about anything.
Isn’t this getting kinda old? He’s been saying this for better part of last 8-10 years and I have seen nothing of the sorts
Yeaaaaaah... but they only get to cosplay as soldiers for the drug busts soooooooo...
I just got a class two felony in Texas for a joint a blunt and 4 edibles when I was driving thru to get to Chicago for a funeral. Smh
What did he like just now say this or something? I thought that had been his stance for a long time
why do the left and right always have to provide these arguments in a combo of two completely different issues. 

I often feel there are loads of groups that can agree with one aspect without having it be related to the other.

Such fallacious manipulation.
The problem is that we can’t afford to buy them off like Wall Street does
This is from a guy whose only job was as a politician who shamelessly leeched off of his wife and friends and lambasts the 95% of wall st workers who just perform their jobs and dont do anything wrong
I’ll be honest - I’m not surprised that Sanders would say that, but we all know we’re viewing this story because of the weed grandma
lol another liberal propaganda shithole sub. you guys ruin everything
bbbbut according to Laura Ingraham that wacky tacky makes people kill!   Yes,  everyone knows that marijuana makes people hyperactive and violent and aggressive!
But how, Bernie? How can I do this??
Never believe that rich old parasites care about financial crimes.
Idk I’m fearing for my life from that drug ridden dope head granny. /s
I find it hilarious when Bernie Sanders is filed under economy.
Really Bernie? Way to get behind something the country has already been supporting. Since you're looking for easy votes just say you support puppies. LMAO
Bernie doesn’t want his base prosecuted; I understand.
Col. Sanders. Hmm. Just another member of Congress dissing Wal Street, the cash cow. His statement is a dog whistle of the lowest order.
Laws are for poor people. If you have money you can get away with almost anything
I got to agree ,i got a med weed card and theres confusion until we decriminilize it .
Stop pulling people over for speeding and instead siege a classroom when a killer is machine gunning innocent children.
Wow, 25 other discussions about this going on in other subs! Such a deep important and controversial comment by Sanders, lol!
https://youtu.be/ehT35-671IM
There people are evil.
Yes, start prosecuting crooks on Wall Street and either start prosecuting or juststart ignoring sublunary stars like the Kardashians, too. Zillionaires are not just but which is the more unjust: A Jeff Bezos or an Ice-Cube who drives a Bugatti Veyron that probably goes from 0 to 60 in 20 gallons? It's not just the worker's marxian surplus value that's funding the Fat Cats: It's also their concert ticket and trinket sales which no capitalist is forcibly extracting from them/ As for ""grass"", it's a biig mess today: Legal here  and illegal across the state border. Legal in society but you can still get canned on the job for it. And which is worst: being yellow mellow or head-butting on a tackle football field?
Election season baby
If Sanders had made it to the white house, what a different world this would be!
Then maybe let’s start with Bernie himself. Dude pays less in taxes than a fireman
Make sure to lock him up to
Says the multi millionaire. Bern needs to sit down and be quiet. Some of us are not buying his bullshit.
hes been saying this since 2015 lol
Imagine what this country would save if we never prosecuted another marijuana case.
[deleted]
Yes this is what the American people need :  more Weed, more hard drugs, free Netflix. Own nothing. Have no human contact. Eternal lockdowns. NEW WORLD ORDER
They should start at the top by penalizing lazy do nothing but miss and cry politicians that don’t even abide by the oath they took when entering congress. They’re the one that keep saying no one’s above the law, even though they voted themselves above the law so long as they are in office. That’s why slander is so prevalent in congress and why they can read a non-existent letter as if were fact so as to get the people hating each other. They are the criminal pukes. If your gonna dislike someone, dislike them they are playing everyone like a fiddle and no one cares. Sad.
Crooks like Hunter Biden!  Yeah!
This is exactly why millions of Americans and I are doing what is called Direct Registering shares of GameStop stock (GME) on Computershare. The idea being that Wall Street Hedge Funds have counterfeited enough shares at this point that I believe over 20x the original amount of shares exist. By Direct Registering, it take the shares out of 'street name' and puts them into 'book' aka your name, by Computershare, Gamestop's chosen entity to do this for them. Already at this point, almost half of the *available* retail shares have been Direct Registered, aka DRS'd. Once this gets to 100% DRS'd, Gamestop reserves the right to take action to eliminate the counterfeit shares (several options here), and has solid plans to do so based in the previous earnings report mention of such share counterfeiting/rehypothecation. This has already seemingly started to liquidate firms like Melvin, Archegos, and Tiger, and I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. I plan on buying more and holding until it all collapses and all their bad, overleveraged bets come to fruition, which would vaporize most if not all GME short hedge funds, and make shareholders a pretty penny. 

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I JUST LIKE THE STOCK and I LIKE THE JUSTICE.
He's really got to get over the whole ""wall street"" thing. There are bigger issues than non violent non existent criminals
Get over here Pelosi.. we got the receipts
Interesting how you're so defensive of slavery ( a form of discrimination), yet have no problem discriminating against an entire country?! You've been promoted to ""interesting garbage"" now lol
Start busting crooks in Washington!
Then make it legal moron!!!!
That’s like saying stop busting murders! God why do they let people talk!
Wow I actually agree with that communist on something
Well, the fact that they’re not doing that 

shows you what a fascist country Murica is anymore
r/politics
in reality? yes. will anyone ever see any consequences? no.
you're telling me Pelosi is NOT the greatest investor of all time?  holy....
Yep. Gotta seize their houses, cars, and boats. It’s the law.
this doesn't even mean companies blatantly breaking current laws are going to face consequences.
Yeah
Yes. Yes. And yes. Did I mention yes?
Always have been, just because they get away with it doesn't make it right.
Yes.  They are.  That's why its called corruption, its just that the Supreme Court called it ""campaign donations,"" so its not treated like corruption.

They are accomplices to every financial crime that is done by that company, if they take campaign donations from that company or anyone attached to them.
All except Bernie Sanders, who is clean as a ....

That's why Bernie's pushing for it.   

There'll only be a handful of American politicians left 😅
Have you checked out r/superstonk? It takes a second to get the subs jist, but behind the memes is a movement taking on Wall Street corruption and it’s actually been making a difference. John Stewart did a very good expose on Wall Street recently and what has been uncovered.
If politicians were held accountable for all the illegal or shady shit they do or support, theyd almost all be in jail. Its a fact that our justice system treats some better than others, which isnt really very just
Wall Street offers a nice incentive package for cops letting them work lucrative security jobs. Hard to bite the lucrative hand that is helping you to fill your coffers.
No, but the ones that have traded stocks based on insider information are absolutely on the chopping block for prosecution.
""allegedly,""  but yes, 99% of them have probably intentionally broken the law, and the rest did it by accident.
The speaking fees that the politicians receive is ironically hush money.
They fucking should be.
Always have been.
Like the first thing would even happen but if it did the second definitely wouldn’t.
Yes.
It’s all designed to milk money from the average investor and prop up funds, banks, and politicians. They used complexity to their advantage and people are finally motivated to see just how blatant and dangerous it actually is
Yes
RICO the Senate
Well, locking people up for smoking weed is a multi-billion dollar industry, much of is publicly traded.  Those same Wall Street crooks make money off of criminalizing people. If they start legalizing marijuana it’s because they have figured out how to make money off of it WHILE locking people up.
It's a whole big RICO case, the DOJ is looking
Would love to see lobbying completely outlawed but we know that will never happen.
I’m a way, they are all complicit in the murder of democracy through the expounding in litigation towards figureheads of indifference that yield nothing but sorrows for the little guy.
They should be but it will never happen, they’re above the law
Sanders is a crook the same as Wall Street.
He lied under oath and lost teachers pension funds!? Crazy people don’t look at this.

**Edit**
Thanks for all the love apes! I love the places I can meet y’all. Once it hits 10m a share, I’ll be throwing a party at my ranch in Colorado! Hold me to it.
Yeah this is the no brainer. Lied under oath. Any one of us would be sitting in a cell right now.
You mean Ken Griffin, the one who put out a statement that he wants to leave Chicago because of crime rates so that when people Google Ken Griffin crime they get those articles rather than all the other crimes? That ken Griffin?
You mean Kenneth Griffin the Chicago based financial terrorist. Subject of this

https://kengriffincrimes.com
Don’t forget cokehead Cramer
100%
Oh you mean the financial criminal Ken Griffin in Chicago.  The billionaire who runs Citadel's in order to skim the top off of the entire stock market. Who also uses his criminal enterprise to heavily lobby(bribe) GOP candidates. I should also mention he buys assets like one of the original declarations of independence. He then later lends these to museums in exchange for favors within the legal system.
Ken Griffin the guy who had the huge options position on Regeneron and donated 10.75 million to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's campaign so he would promote monoclonal antibodies while spreading anti-vax propaganda? The same DeSantis who today publicly declared victory for getting the Special Olympics to drop their vaccine requirement? That Ken Griffin?
You mean financial terrorist, who lied under oath Ken griffin?
Good to know this sub also hates that cocksucker
All my homies hate Kenneth Griffin
Crime is the secret ingredient
Would love to see it.
I’ve found my people in another sub ☺️
The same Ken Griffin that is the single largest GOP donator? The same guy who owns the most expensive home in the United States? The guy who made a living abusing market maker privilege to profit off from destroying countless tech and medical companies? Yeah, that sounds like a good start.
Please upvote this
\*APES HAVE ENTERED THE CHAT\*
Apes in the wild!
Do you mean Ken Cordell Griffin, financial terrorist and illegal short hedge fund manager of Citadel Securities and Citadel LLC? The criminal Ken Griffin? The illegal short seller? That Mayo lovin son of a bitch.
Kenneth Cordelle Griffin? Degenerate thief and wife beater?
Ken Griffin who couldn't control his emotions and threw a bed post at his wife?
He’s currently spending tens of millions to get his selected puppet (Richard Irvin) get elected Governor in Illinois.

It’s going terribly for them so far which is hilarious to see, but still sickening watching him try and openly purchase a Governor
His army is downvoting this
Sanders' proposed 1-cent-per-trade tax would have shitfucked HFTs and help level the playing field

Taking matters into our own hands now I guess
I heard that twat shorted cancer research companies into the ground?
Or you know Sanders has interesting stock trades, how is he a multimillionaire on a Senators salary lmao

Ty everyone for proving my point! Keep voting!
Does anyone else see this thread with 500 comments, 3 awards, and only 20 upvotes? 

Think this one hit a spot with our corporate overlords? Cause their downvote bots are here in force 😂
Ken Griffey is a legend. Cleanest swing in the history of baseball. Why u wanna arrest him? Cuz he's black? Racist ass dirtbag.
Found the guy who still thinks it’s someone else fault he lost money investing in a dying video game retailer.
lol why do Apes have to ruin all subs.
Who's Ken Griffin?
Or Elon
What’s a baseball player got to do with it?
Yes. Fucking Griffin needs to go to prison where he can’t hurt people any longer.
And if this guy doesnt play ball, maybe his son will. You know, Ken Griffin Jr
He lives in 220 central park south, NYC 59th street. if the internet cares to know.
After that, every single Congress worker and Senator (AND THEIR FUCKING SPOUSES) for insider trading.
The guy who donated $5m to Chicago to repair the bike paths and always gives good interviews?
A good idea is good.

That's like rounding up the kids selling party hits on the corner. 

They're not the problem. They're just lackeys. On the payroll.
Why not both Wall Street *and* Capitol Hill?
They are all hand in glove. 
People are literally cattle to them .
this one right here!!!
Congress is peanuts compared to Wall Street. The crime on Wall Street materially affects everyone, Congress is just grifting a little off the top. We're talking hundreds of billions versus hundreds of millions here. Targeting Wall Street would do much more to help most people.
Capitol Hill and walstreet are one in the same bub
Porque nos los dos
Or for putting politics over the American People they are supposed to represent.
Or bad faith politicians.
Why not both!
Start prosecuting redditors for that and price fixing as well.
This sounds exactly like the crazy Trumptards on FB who always, always, always vaguely agree with Sanders, but refocus whatever Sanders is talking about onto the government. I'm not saying your a Trumptard, just pointing out this odd similarity because you're not the only person commenting the same sort of thing in this post.
Who do you think is funding the crooks on capitol hill lol
You mean like Bernie?  Sure thing
Same crooks
Yup. Start with Pelosi.
I will continue to say we need a hard reset. Fire all Federal elected officials and start from scratch.
Will never happen, greed and corruption of the upper class is the definition of America
Sanders would 100% agree
Them, CEOs & board directors of massive corporations, Wall Street cucks who profit from everyone else being royally fucked over...
The terrible returns congress members have proves they’re not insider trading.
That's not a crime, y'all's ignorance of the law use wild
Guess who funds their campaigns and spends millions lobbying them?
The Senate is responsible for policing the Senate. doubt we will ever see any real action against them.
I ***am*** the senate.
Politicians are the biggest crooks in the country. Let's clean house there.

I’m sorry friend. I smoke daily and sometimes wonder how long I will go before I catch a charge with it all...
What is your record for and it is state or federal?
I hate that you guys have to go through this. The world’s depressing enough as it is like damn let people blow off stream how they want to. I work full time and go to school full time and I’m not hurting anyone, what’s the issue? Seems like the country of freedom isn’t so free
Why? It was illegal when you did it. I assume the junk you smoke now is still illegal? Still funding criminals?
What’s the reminder? Democratic primaries are a weird meta-game forcing people to vote based on other characteristics besides policy?
primary fraud is the absolute pinnacle of democracy
But Bernie would've beaten Trump; in all honesty, I believe neoliberals prefer Trump to Bernie (even if they won't admit it).
Yeah, that’s how votes work
Yes he tried twice and D people rejected him twice. We remember.
Good!  Bernie wasn’t the most popular candidate!

The DNC screwed Sanders over in 2016, but for the 2020 election, he conceded well ahead and endorsed Biden heartily, the two situations aren’t the same.
Anecdotal but I still vividly remember a discussion with some left leaning friends during the election about Hilary. They all supported Bernie but hated Hilary and a few of them voted for trump as a result. So yes I also fully believe Bernie would have beaten trump. Man that morning waking up to trump as president is still seared into my memory. Felt like a shit dream
Yeah that's why I didn't vote in the last two presidential elections too.
Yep, and they took sweet corporate cash, prevented change and allowed the slip into fascism
Sanders rolled over both times.
We need open primaries and Ranked Choice Voting
Just a reminder: Bernie is not a Democrat.
Brainwash. And here we are. The mass can’t recognize the good. Media is the ultimate evil.
Endorsed by Bernie.
 I couldn't disagree more.
Disagree with Sanders about his policies as much as you want, but he always has been one of the actual honest, noncorrupt candidates in America who genuinely care about the American people and realize how corporate interests dominate our politics.
Too big to fail is not a concept, it's a reality. I'm afraid you can't just write that off.
I was initially opposed to him as well. The media's portrayal of him is highly inaccurate though. Go watch a long form interview where he methodically explains his positions. You'll have a completely different understanding of the man.
[deleted]
Bernie is a popular figure and there is a wake behind him that is allowing young up and coming progressive politicians to get their footing. He is setting the tone and direction.
Why not both?

that’s the best way to drop crime rate, just don’t charge anybody for crime and then celebrate we don’t have crime problem  :)
How would you expect people of the lower class to obey rules that the ruling class doesn’t follow themselves? Good attempt to sway the conversation away from the real problem, but I think you’ve fallen flat on your face here. You know why crime is so high in cities? Because people there are fighting over scraps just to get by. I know you wish to vilify the lower class but the problem is and always has been the elites who are running things, whether it be the big banks, big pharmaceutical (you know the ones who think OxyContin should be overprescribed and think that kids need to be given copious amounts of meth to sit still) the military industrial complex (who increases their profits by sending blank checks to Ukraine) or each and every person in our government (the ones receiving tons of money from lobbyists to keep the rules in favor of the elite.) It’s so easy to blame poor people but anytime blame starts to shift to the ruling class, people like you are around to shift it back.
At the end of the day it's all government resources. Give them to people busting people for drugs, or give them to people busting white collar criminals.
Totally. Not to mention, the burden of proof is way easier for a possession charge than for insider trading or whatnot. If you have a body camera and are facing someone with weed, that's a slam dunk prosecution.
Cops are just the first step. Courts and prisons are overwhelmed.
It’s just fantasy. “Big bank bad! boo boo!”, “They make money so it must be illegal!”.

People cheer for actors and sport stars making millions but somehow think it’s unfair for banking executives to do the same. I think the reason is actually simple. Actors and sport stars are useful to them because they watch movie and sports. But they don’t care about people working in Wall Street because they don’t see the benefit for themselves and then are herded by politicians that tell them bankers are the bogeyman.
I feel like I should say ahead of time, I am not a fan either. What do you not like about him?

It's hard to like what he says until he speaks on extremely genralized platitudes. Then he goes into his specific vision and says ""tax every stock trade for every individual investor!1!"" and we can all safely go back to ignoring his BS again
sadly I think you are correct :(
How do you know this?
Bernie Sanders' wife lied to a bank about donations from alumni of the college she was provost of to get a loan to purchase land for a new campus location. 

Youre probably thinking of Rick Scott, who placed his wife in charge of Solantic in Florida when he became governor. He then pushed for drug testing of welfare recipients which Solantic was the beneficiary of.

You’re right
Oh Im sorry do you own this sub? You could always just keep scrolling hot-shot.
This is what defeatism looks like, kids
Bernie is good at platitudes but he's a fucking terrible politician. And I get that's part of why a lot of his supporters like him but it makes him an ineffective blowhard and it's why he lost his presidential primaries.

In politics you need to come to the table with actionable ideas and then *work with others* to find support and implement those ideas. You need to form coalitions, not alienate your colleagues while tweeting shit that makes nonvoters cheer and center of the aisle voters look elsewhere.
This sentence is a mess

oh well if joe biden wants the wall street guys to get away with it, Bernie will do anything he possibly can to help. They can hide their stolen and fraudulent assets in one of the spare houses he got for stopping the left in 2016 and 2020.

Ah yes, the ""stolen election"" claim that was literally debunked by multiple *state GOP led investigations*. You know, the people  with literally the most incentive in the world to find evidence of fraud. 

Every single Trump election case: lost (and laughed out of court). 

Every single investigation: came up empty.

Why don't you fascists have the balls to just come out and say it? You don't think the election was stolen. You're just willing to throw democracy aside and overturn any election that you lost. At least then I could respect the honesty. 

But this cringey years-long ""iT WaS sToLeN"" tantrum is just pathetic.
That’s too bad that all of Trump‘s false election fraud claims were thrown at a court.  Trump is nothing more than a greedy, corrupt liar.  He is a sore loser and will cry fraud at anything.

The black market exists because there is no legal market.  The black market can't turn to the civil authorities for obvious reasons, so they create their own enforcement or else get ripped off.  Outlawed drugs and prostitution generates gang activity and makes sex work vulnerable to exploitation.  We wouldn't get rid of street crime or sex trafficking overnight by legalizing and regulating all drugs and prostitution, but it would help dramatically.

I’m sorry, do have such a lack of understanding about how the government works, that you think one senator can sign things into law at a federal level?

He’s tried but one person can’t change the entire system singlehanded
Surprisingly the French Revolution only moved about 9% of the total wealth of the rich aristocracy into the poorest classes. The reality is that there was a horizontal movement of assets from the wealthy to the new government which then leased or lended properties and money to the lower classes. People who we'd now consider ""middle class"" were virtually untouched by the revolution. It took a few generations before people's standards of living increased and even then much of the population was still very poor.
How can you be when you say something so vague as to be utterly pointless?  Who should be prosecuted and for what broken laws?
He’s a communist …always has been… always will be .period
He's the best but he doesn't poll well because he calls himself a 'progressive socialist'.  Without hearing his message, republicans translate 'socialist' to 'communist"".  Which isn't the case of course.  He's the people's politician, and the more power he has the better off we would all be.

The police arrest more people for possession of marijuana than for all violent crimes combined.

Yes, Bernie should just do it all by himself. Not like the other 99 senators voting against him will be a problem…
🤡
“Zero Credibility”
Which Nazi’s?

Arresting people for marijuana is not cleaning up the streets. It's immorally arresting people for nonsense crimes
Because we will end up with an economy like Venezuela‘s.
Technically it’s more work to bust someone on the wall street then some guy with weed in his pocket.
Are you even from America? If you are then this comment is a pretty good indication of why our education system has failed.
Yes, there are still people getting busted
exactly , anyone educated can find that there are no botanical examples of a marijuana plant ... Easy , search 

Phylum of marijuana ,  Taxonomical data for a marijuana plant  ....  No such plant exists 1!!!!   no way to trace and botanical lineage
Wtf?
I’d say ban all drugs and alcohol. Imprison people who can’t follow rules.
Its not a dog whistle if the message is not hidden.
No, it'd be the exact same world lol.

The problem is waiting for Congress to apply consequences to themselves. That is absolutely never going to happen. If we ever want real change it’s going to be up to the people to apply consequences to Congress. Nationwide general strikes. Unrelenting protests outside the homes of criminal elected officials and those that enable them. Boycotting of the companies that elected officials insider trade in. Only once we band together and make noticeable waves will Congress ever consider amending the rules in a way that doesn’t benefit them.

Ofc, that’s just as much of a far cry as Congress going after one of their own in the first place. They’ve masterfully divided the masses to stand against each on fabricated issues so that the people are too distracted to notice the fact that their pockets are being picked.
Wen RICO visit DC and Wall St?

I would say that this falls under SEC and DOJ jurisdiction, but those agencies are both as useful as a wet paper bag.

Who do you think controls the media? The people, or the crooks doing this?
Didn’t you hear?! It was the small time investors that did it! Even Gary Gensler said that the retail investors were trading meme stocks. Is it even legal for the SEC to negatively label stocks on the market like that? Every company he grouped together as a meme stock should sue the SEC for slander and libel. Shouldn’t it be considered unethical and illegal to talk down about a business, their stock, and the market? GG is a joke.

You see, you know how to *take* the oath, you just don't know how to *keep* the oath. And that's really the most important part of the oath: the keeping. Anybody can just take them.
Well we are flying into Denver just give us a place to meet and a list of what to bring 😆
How does he have $25 billion dollars then? He should pay those teachers with his own money that he stole…
Count this Texas ape in, I'll bring the brisket!
Ken Griffey had nothing to do with teachers pensions. He hit 600 hr you white supremacist trash.
Its awesome seeing fellow SuperStonk apes in the wild. \*tips hat\*
His army is downvoting this
And is trying to buy a Republican seat as Governor
Hello can you provide a link please? I’m trying to find it on google and nothing is coming uo
Wait wait wait...Kenny said it was me and my friends spending our stimmy checks from our Moms' basements that sunk teacher's pensions!?!?
Please upvote this
I doubt your gme is ever gonna reach 300 bucks again let alone 10mil.
Love it dawg lol we're trying so hard to inform the public and they're so close. I guess it's up to us to save this shitonomy
I think ya’ll are referring to Kenneth Cordelle Griffin. The American financial terrorist slash criminal, Ken Griffin, amirite?
I thought it was the Ken Griffin that bought a copy of the Constitution to throw off the web searches for his crimes
That’s the one!
Is that the guy who hit his wife with a bed post the night before their wedding, that Ken Griffen?
Other than the crimes Ken griffin committed
Ken Griffey didn't play for Chicago. He played for Seattle you dumb Nazi.
That’s the one!
Ape strong together
Steve Cohen and Jeff Yass too!
r/superstonk for very thorough research by redditors on that topic and the stock market in general
I think that’s the guy
And 11 herbs and spices
Book
He wrote a bestselling book my friend
Stfu. You know nothing.
Dude if you don't have at least 1m+ throughout your retirement accounts by the time you are his age, you are thoroughly fucked, book or not.
He's been making six figures for decades...
He wrote a best selling book.
Hey bud, not sure if you're out of the loop or just collectively fucking with us, but OP is referring to Kenneth Griffin, not Ken Griffey or Ken Griffey Jr.

Ken Griffin is a scumfuck hedgefund manager. That's why we want him arrested, among other things.
Man!  Wasn't he a legend though?!  I mean, he's no Ryne Sandberg, but still impressive.
Seriously. 630 dingers. No peds. Leave KG Jr alone goddamnit!
Only person that lost money was ken griffin and co. When they gambled away the pensions of those teachers. 

Ask Melvin capital how it's been going for them. Last I heard they were being liquidated. 

You referring to the dying brick and mortar that has been doing nothing but growing in sales? The same place that's about to do a stock split and divened? The same company that has took top level employees from the likes of Amazon, apple, Microsoft, and many other giants? The same place that has many exciting partnerships that were just announced? Same place that has over 2 billion in capital and no debt other than a small French COVID relief loan?

Are we talking about the same place or are you just a little bit retarded?
This is what happens when you lose your money in shitty investments.
I don't know but he plays a mean sax
Same here
We're all working class people. Anyone who sees the inequality in the world should have a real conversation with anyone over at the Stonk.

Own your property. Delete the middleman. Transparency.
Not really, people working in government are the smallest of fish in the schemes going on. Superstonk is more about financial terrorism and big funds able to naked short a stock many multiples above their outstanding shares and basically just take everyones money over and over on the promise to pay back the shares, but whoops the company went bankrupt looks like we get to keep all that money.
That's why I invested my life savings into GameStop, I Direct Registered my Shares (DRS). 
 It means they remove my shares from the hands of corrupt hedge funds, and people who gamble people's 401k's and stock investments. (Bernie Madoff, Ken Griffin and people that caused all the crashes. 
 And the SEC doesn't do anything to stop it, so the only way to stop them from stealing from teachers and nurses  pensions is to DRS your shares. 
 YOU own them snd THEY can't gamble YOUR money away.
 It's wild, I had no idea how much crime happens with Wall Street. It's the ONLY way to stop them.

Superstonk is the financial equivalent of the quanon bullshit.

Turns out that stuff they talk about has >30 years of evidence to back up across a number of stocks and can be linked to the wealthiest people in the world controlling the lives of all of us peasants. 

Go figure.
yeah!
If anybody is truly interested in learning more about how the whole system is set up to quietly steal your money, including our supposed ""protectors"" in the SEC, there is a hell of a library in the superstonk menu.
Prosecute all of them. None of us are Democrats or Republicans.

Notice how Sanders is independent and the only one with a voice of reason? Yeah, that's not an accident.
Ehhh I kinda disagree. The ones making legislature have huge power to sway the landscape in ways that would be favorable to their portfolios. Just look at the senators who dumped their stocks in hotels and airlines *before* breaking the news on covid and lockdown restrictions. If they really cared about the public's best interest they would blow the whistle for that kind of thing first, and worry about their shares and dividends later. Or better yet, not be allowed to hold or trade stocks at all while in office. But who's going to legislate for that? Not them.
and like handing someone a gun and asking them to shoot themselves in the foot
Brilliant!
Then they can have some Battle Royale amongst themselves on one of their private tropical islands to fight for their freed... Wait, too soon? Not quite there yet? Never mind.

Because the last time some idiot democrat proposed price controls, there were mass gas shortages and rationing. Maybe do some reading.
Imagine being so stupid you think high gas prices are caused by ""gouging"" rather than supply and demand, and the fact that there is a severely limited supply of oil due to no new drilling permits being issued by the Biden administration.

Some of the DD is sure hard to wrap my mind around. So many people have no idea what truly happens with all the criminal activity going on with Wall St.
Lol “read the DD,” you people are fucking delusional
What's the dealio fellow redditor
The subreddit /r/ superstonk is a cult that tells you to invest all your money in a stock.
Where are you located? It might not even be a thing. 

I got nicked in Ohio 15 years ago for possession that isn't even a crime anymore and it's still on my record.
That was a big factor in moving to a legal state for me. I had gone that long without a record, but it seemed like only a matter of time if I stayed in a prohibition state.
I work live  in a state that it's still illegal. My company sent out a mandate about CBD and Delta 8. Saying we aren't allowed to use it and we can get fired. 

I can walk into several stores and buy it legally.
Have like five paraphernalia charges. I have one where I had a bowl of weed at school. That got dismissed but it's not expunged, still on my record. That little amount made it hard to find a school district I could work in. Don't have any felonies, thank God. Can't imagine all the poor people that had a few ounces or pounds that got charged with manufacturing or something like that.
I've probably only had one cop give me a break. He's the only one that caught me with weed which was just like two grams and just threw it out, stepped on it, took my pipe and gave me a speeding ticket. Great guy, he made me laugh... I've been caught with pipes in other occasions and I've had k9 units called on me to search the car for weed. One time they put my car on a tow truck over a pipe. This other cop gave me a ticket because my car smelled and he found what seriously was grass by my feet. Fought that and won.  A bunch of fucking dunces.
It doesn't need to be illegal to begin with when something like alcohol kills so many of our loved ones every day. Marijuana would also be good for industry and food. You act like the law is irrefutable.
Reminder that the party machinery has ways to *make* its will manifest.

They don't even have to change the vote counts. Changing rules without notice, stalling certain actions that are supposed to happen, using their influence to time certain acts of news ... an outsider does not have anything *near* a fair chance.

And Bernie still managed to get 40% of the vote in that rigged system.

***

The good news is that there are now a *lot* more people who are familiar with how the system works.
Them trying to make the candidates promise to elect minorities and lbgt ppl to their cabinets during the debates was so cringe. Corporate democrats spew nothing but identity politics it’s exhausting.
More like the DNC is a completely corrupt organization.
Uhm, were you not aware of the shenanigans they pulled during the last DNC leadership race?
“Ok everybody we all know you don’t actually have real choices or freedom of choice in this country, so to beat the other team we have to pick the most bland milquetoast candidate imaginable that mostly represents our entire ‘side’, so that we can outnumber the radically uneducated and angry gun loving boot lockers who dream of a Christian sharia law taking away rights of everyone they don’t like. It’s totally unfair but what are you gonna do about it? We’ve already distracted you all with conflict amongst yourselves while we looted your pensions and future savings because after all, *we* make the laws.”
The lesson is that ranked choice voting would’ve solved the problem entirely.

If you want Bernie but you’re worried he’ll lose to another Dem, rank Bernie 1 and the other Dems accordingly. If Bernie actually does lose, your vote just transforms into your number 2 (or your top choice still in the race).

It’s kind of fucked up that in order to fix our politics we have to deal with these weird meta-problems about how we even choose candidates.
That southern wall...
Meta-game?  How do you figure?
Voters rejected his policies twice, time to accept it

Just like how they stole it from TRUMP. Right ?
Is that how you get people to upvote ""Voter fraud"" on reddit? Rename it something so they don't realize what they're upvoting?
There's no way Bernie would've beaten Trump. I wish that wasn't true - I'd prefer Bernie over Biden - but there's no evidence that'd be the case.

Bernie lost all of the critical swing states to Hillary and Biden by a pretty large margin. Those swing states were narrowly won by Trump in 2016 and narrowly won by Biden in 2020. How a candidate performs in those swing states is the single biggest predicter of whether they can win the rest of the election, and Bernie has not been able to pull that off unfortunately.
they did admit it. you can literally go back and search for it, washington post and a few other papers were putting out articles about how trump was preferable to bernie
The only way you could actually believe this is by really, really wanting to

Welcome to r/neoliberal! We are one of the fastest growing communities on Reddit. Bring back free trade and lower inflation!

Protectionists, populists, and socialists can suck an egg! (And because of that, no, we don't like Trump... or his nasty tariffs that Biden has yet to remove.)
Uh huh
Lol wut
I voted for Sanders in the march 17 Illinois primary. Then I voted for trump in November.
I voted for Bernie in both primaries but he probably wouldn’t have beaten Trump.
Honesty is just about all I want out of my candidates these days.

I don't particularly like or agree with Bernie, never felt the Bern, but absolutely I would have voted for him and still will if I have the opportunity.
He would have. Polled consistently better than Trump, and appeals to the same pool of people tired of politics that Trump pulled from. Many folks that were lifelong R's would have been glad to vote for Bernie over Trump.
No, they don’t. We don’t, not by a long shot
I'm not 
I prefer voting for politicians who actually do what they say they're going to do. 

And so much for the fucking economy anyways. Hold on for this shit to crash.
> How many times do we need to teach you the same lesson?

People like them will, quite literally, never learn.

They will continue to back in national elections, candidates who are popular only in left leaning enclaves. Those candidates will continue to lose. And people like the person you're responding will continue to blame anyone but themselves.
Yes thank you.  Biden had 10 million more votes than Bernie; Hillary 3 million more. 

It isn’t some “wow Bernie got fucked by the system” thing. It’s people don’t like Bernie outside the Reddit bubble
That's simply not true. If you poll issue by issue, the candidate that most voters agreed with was Bernie. Facts are facts.
For your information: Bernie is considered center in Europe. Right in the middle, not progressive at all. 

It’s the conservatives in America that are on the wrong side of history, not the “progressives”. 

Just look at the state of your country should tell you enough, unfortunately you’re not capable to understand. 

How about you “get over it” and you and your country men might have a better future.
Whatever helps you sleep at night.
Your friends sound fucking insane. Hope they’re thrilled about SCOTUS
Why do you think I voted for him?
Bernie is absolutely the fucking GOAT. he’s the only politician i’ve ever donated to, and i am still livid that the DNC fucked him (and *us*) over like they did. this country would be in a much better place than it is, had Bernie been elected, as he rightly should’ve been. further proof that this is not a democracy— we are an oligarchy. and a shitty one, at that.

Until you cut the head off the snake you will continue to see the erosion of morality in America.

Aye, control mechanisms suppress the statistics and oppress the oppressed. Abolish the military, defund the police. Social efforts are literally the only long term option that actually helps people and reduces crime. Universal basic income. Free healthcare. Free public transport. 6 hour work days. 

Because we can fucking afford to take care of everyone, if we didn't torrent cash into private businesses. A hundred years of massive improvements to productive forces and all we got was excessive consumption, tax breaks, social cost cutting, inflation, rate hikes and an economy that screws the working class and the poor at all times.

People have become infected, protecting private profits in favor of redistributing power and resources to the masses. The politics are driven by economical motives, not out of compassion for fellow human beings. The time for revolution is now.
You can enforce both misdemeanors and felonies and white collar and street crimes. It's silly to suggest otherwise.  

Whether or not marijuana should be illegal is a separate issue.
""hello SEC this is the kenosha police department, good news we don't care about weed anymore lol.  if we mail you a check can you plz arrest some more bankers?""
You seriously think the local cops not arresting people for weed will increase the federal and state government's investigations of white collar crimes? Two different systems.
Hell we had a florida man who was so high or drunk he walked the police to his crops to show the officers how impressive they were.
Literally two different court systems. You guys really should learn how your own government works.

Yeah, how do you get a meeting with a senator tho?  There is a clear line between being a polling statistic and having an actual voice.
Nah, he'd rather stop around mad all day. Guys like him are worse than virtue signaling assholes - at least those folks think they're *trying* to do something positive. This guy just wants to spread hate.
What I’m saying is Wall Street loves Bernie Sanders as their opponent because they know his words are ineffective and his efforts in vain. Wall Street corruption, wealth inequality and congressional violations regarding the stock market have worsened dramatically under his impotent watch. I would support anyone (or group as I believe it would take a large group of very powerful people undeterred by Wall Street bribery { which none of our politicians seem to be} to reign in Wall Street) who could be proactive in stopping the corruption.
It’s realism, im not a defeatist. I’m a skeptic and a sucker for real results. If you want to see someone Ive supported who cares about his cause and is proactively effective in it, google Louis Rossman and his fight for right to repair. Bernie Sanders on the other hand, is not Louis Rossman.

Edit: I would support anyone who could end Wall Street corruption. It’s not, nor had it ever been Bernie Sanders that could do it. And if you saw Bernie’s finances, for a guy that’s done almost notjing, you may agree.

[This is a pretty good list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enough_Sanders_Spam/comments/f3n8im/giant_opposition_research_thread_on_bernie_sanders/) of all the bad/unethical things Bernie has done. Ranging from enriching his friends and family to just being hypocritical.
His constant virtue signaling with protestors but never really doing anything about it. You can also check his voting record. People of color (who sanders claims to care about) were refusing the Cv vax and losing their jobs over it. Yet sanders was pro mandate. Also why did quietly let Biden “win” the nomination?
Cant say I liked ANY of the options we have had last few elections.

Bernie was the president we needed, but not the one we deserved. A dark knight.
I’m don’t know, he did lose at least one cage match with a shower door
Yea the guy who couldn't win a primary would have beat Trump. Lmao.
Sure, talk about what government should do or how people should live as long as they don't do what he's doing. The guy has spent his life promoting socialism, ALL ARE EQUAL, and in government service, has 3 homes and a net worth of $3 million. Pick a side, go balls out, and be a hypocrite?
How is it good? America is already in debt so printing 40 billion to add to the national debt is ridiculous. Our politicians should be tarred and feathered for giving 40 billion to ukraine that Americans will be paying the interest on.
Ok, I'll listen. Please explain.
Sure thing but I hate socialism 🤷🏻
But we don’t want drug operations hindered! :)
Biden could pull a Trump and just tell them not to enforce any of the laws on a federal level :)
Biden could literally instruct that weed be rescheduled.
When it’s popular enough in enough states. Or you can work to get a ballot initiative and do it locally.
It surprises me not at all that the MIC is corrupt.
Sure. He was elected democratically. 

But he is a marxist intermediate socialist, which is communism with extra steps, and either way you slice it to believe these are functioning economic systems at this late date is ridiculous.
Which house did he get by throwing an election? The one his in-law gave to them when they died? The in DC where he works? Or the one in Vermont where he lives?
You mean the left that was just unpopular with the core Democratic base?
hey dude, just wanted to give you a reminder - it's spelt crungo, not cringe you crungolord
Remember when he cried ""RIGGED"" when he won against Hillary? And then the dumbass realized he won?
you mean like how hillary cried for years that the evil russians hacked the election and it was a fraud presidency, louder and more enthusiastically than he ever did, with much less pushback or fact checking?
nah biden's still president he seems to have pretty successfully done that. most popular president in history, remember? lowest approval ratings of any president in history, but hes simultaneously the most beloved and popular one. make it make sense.
Lmao cope because you can’t argue with the facts
What has happened in the past decade?
Absolutely there is. At least a logical one. It's illegal at the federal level. Legalize it, federally, and no one will get busted for it anymore. This half-ass situation where the federal government says, ""Yeah, it's illegal, but we're not going to enforce those laws."" is about the worst situation we can have. If the government gets to pick and choose what laws to enforce and who they are enforced against, we will be in a world we don't want. In this case it seems to be marijuana laws are enforced against the poor, and minorities, but not others at the same rate. If that's ok then it's ok to let wall street get away with financial crimes that you and I can't. Or congressmen can get away with damn near anything.
The world is corrupted by people. You’re at fault.
I fail to see where i said that drinking is good. Is it really that hard for people to not do something illegal and then complain that they got into trouble?
Please don't feed me these perpetually wrong libertarian talking points. It's easier than ever to get cheap Black Market weed than it ever has been Thanks to legalization

Cigarettes being legal doesn't stop loose cigarettes from being sold for cheap. Legal liquor doesn't stop moonshining stills
I'm not? You don't even know the difference between ""your"" and ""you're"". Yeah, I need to take advice from you.

I don't know why Reddit is forcing these posts on me.
You see this is what a leader does he rallies all of his party members behind him and actually writes legislation. If he did that I'm curious to know when. I'm sorry making a Twitter post is not rallying your troops behind you. I would argue there's not a single piece of legislation that has ever passed through the house and the Senate that didn't start with the idea of one person and other people joining in and working on it, that's how it works.
Well, all that tells me is that they did not have the benefit of contemporary political and economic theory to better allocate the wealth of the bourgeoisie. The middle class of revolution era france does not really correlate to the current, american, middle class. Moreover, their poor were literally starving and dying in the streets. That the poorest saw any improvement is a small victory. This suggests that more of the ruling elite needed to be liberated of their assets and wealth. It is likely the failure to properly address the needs of the poor and middle classes that led to the rise and success of bonapartism both in the case of Napoleon and his would be successors. Do more for those at the bottom or you end up falling victim to protofascism (then) or neofascism (now).
Did you read the title?
What the absolute fuck are you even arguing about.
Yeah it's not like the democrats control all 3 houses......Fucking worthless all of them. All talk and no show.
All *other* violent crime combined. Drug use is violence.
His job as a politician is to work with others to get things done, not just the 99 in the senate, but the house and elsewhere
weed is like alcohol. we arrest for substance abuse and for use in public where it is not allowed, and for use when opperating machinery etc. Dont defend something just because you like it and cant see how it does NOT help society.
Why
Obviously I’m not as my question made obvious 🙄
Self explanatory
There wouldn't have been the Trump era environmental back pedalling. Americans would have affordable health care. And lots more.
Not his.
If everyone that worked at Amazon and Walmart said fuck it and stopped going to work, shit would get done. Too bad people cant afford to not work to stand up for themselves. Its almost like the system is set up that way....
Why can't we do it like the good old days, with guillotines and arson? 😔
Exactly. I agree 100%. We have to band together. Hence, division they instill in people. Until then nothing will happen, it will only get worse and worse
Problem is, individualism is the “sacred burden” of the American people. Wealthy and privileged people getting to tell us that in this country we are all our own islands, on an at-will social contract with everyone else. You get to only worry about yourself and yours and nobody will judge you for it because none of us can take the time to actually help anyone else, even if we wanted to.  

We have at LEAST 25% of people who wouldn’t piss on their neighbors house fire to put it out. 40% can’t help because they’re on the edge themselves, 30% give whatever they can but can’t ever hope to put a dent in the problem and the last 5% are trying to figure out how to escape the dirty poors of the earth and start exploiting asteroids a la Alien Weland-Yutani style.

America’s obsession with individualism will be its downfall, politicians all talk about ways to make individuals succeed and use their own power. We are a nation of temporarily embarrassed millionaires, “when I get rich…”, “when my ship comes in”, “when I win the lottery”, “when my inheritance comes due…”, “when my invention takes off”, “when a talent scout finds me”, “when I sell *object*…”

If we could gather our guts and HELP each other we could DO strikes, sit-ins and walkouts. If I could count on my neighbors to help feed me or if they could help guard my house during chaos, ANYTHING…but I don’t even know their names. I don’t know how they will react in times of need. 

The rich convinced us that we had power as individuals. We need to remember there is REAL power in numbers.
Washington DC is literally a prosecution free zone for criminal activities within it, especially if your a democrat.
>If we ever want real change it’s going to be up to the people to apply consequences to Congress. 

Ummm, how about not voting them into office. How about average citizens running for office? The people have always had the power. Are they going to use it? Now there's the question.
So long as there’s no term limits and congress is largely exempt from the laws congress makes ain’t nuthin gonna change. I’m thinking another 40-50 years of this running off the rails and then the apartheid state the US will have become probably by mid century or a little after, will have a serious reckoning…
Also tar and feather and other 'uncivil' disobeidence, clearly protests/marches aren't doing a god damn thing and none of us organized. Not saying they need or should be harmed or killd, but scare the living daylights out of em will do.
Be like the Plebeians, from the wiki:
The plebeians were able to achieve their political goals by a series of secessions from the city: ""a combination of mutiny and a strike""
Right like vaxs, guns, race, lgbtq, me2, energy, science 🤪and many more
I’ve thought it would be interesting if the people had the ability to initiate referendums that becomes law if approved during an election. Unfortunately, that would require a constitutional amendment - which would NEVER get through congress.
Time for the American people to fight for term limits for Congress - Representatives and Senators serving 8-15 terms is insane.
Preach on my brother! 👏👏
I definitely believe in a revamping of America.
> They’ve masterfully divided the masses to stand against each on fabricated issues so that the people are too distracted to notice the fact that their pockets are being picked.

Yesterday I was on r/conservative and some Michigan lawmaker was implying how everyone should just drive an electric car to avoid high gas prices. Of course they went into a frenzy about how dems are only for the rich and don’t care about the working class. Gee I wonder where I’ve heard that argument. We’re all fighting the same battle on different sides. The sooner we realize that the better our future will be.
> far cry

GOTY
Public lynchings..
Before we stand up and protest against any corrupt elected officials they will take your second amendment. These criminals will sacrifice kids to pass their gun control agenda.
...don't be scared to make that last line read properly: ""...to notice how bad they're being FUKD by the upper 1%...""
Just a suggestion...
I love this. But I’m worried that we have people who vote republican, no matter what. 

I feel for those people, who may or may not release that they’ve voted for their own demise.

They want the death camps for LGTBQ people and minorities, but eventually the fascists end up killing the poor white people who elected them.
Part of me wonders if nobody cares and that’s why this hasn’t  happened.  Or if anyone who tries gets suicided
Obviously because their goal is to keep us divided.
They got the masses too worried about who’s black and who’s white and who’s democrat vs. Republican so they won’t focus on the real problem. Them.

The SEC and DOJ are complicit.
I would prefer the wet paper bag to either of those.
Hey I can use wet paper bags in my garden. So they are more useful than the SEC

They won’t unless they’re affiliated with Conservative populism. Take Peter Navarro who was a lifelong Democrat for example. We need help. I speak in echo chambers 99.9% of the time. Hope I reach some people. We need American to unify if we are to win. These Globalist fucks want to punish us all. See Russell Brands video 6/3 with Schwab and the WEF/Davos. He’s red pilled as fuck now. I didn’t understand things fully either but time has a way of revealing things.
I get that you're trying to be clever and all, and that it's ""popular"" these days to just shit on government agencies regardless of justification or situation, but it's just so goddamned incorrect for you people to assume that all government officials and institutions are corrupt, inept, or both. It's wrong, and detrimental to our democracy, the grandest and noblest social experiment in human history. Shame on you. I swear to God your generation is the absolute worst generation, period, ever, period. Period.

A wet paper bag is great for suffocating peasents.

#I stopped pushing as hard as I could against the handle, I wanted to leave but it wouldn't work. Then there was a bright flash and I felt myself fall back onto the floor. I put my hands over my eyes. They burned from the sudden light. I rubbed my eyes, waiting for them to adjust.

Then I saw it.

There was a small space in front of me. It was tiny, just enough room for a couple of people to sit side by side. Inside, there were two people. The first one was a female, she had long brown hair and was wearing a white nightgown. She was smiling.

The other one was a male, he was wearing a red jumpsuit and had a mask over his mouth.

""Are you spez?"" I asked, my eyes still adjusting to the light.

""No. We are in spez."" the woman said. She put her hands out for me to see. Her skin was green. Her hand was all green, there were no fingers, just a palm. It looked like a hand from the top of a puppet.

""What's going on?"" I asked. The man in the mask moved closer to me. He touched my arm and I recoiled.

""We're fine."" he said.

""You're fine?"" I asked. ""I came to the spez to ask for help, now you're fine?""

""They're gone,"" the woman said. ""My child, he's gone.""

I stared at her. ""Gone? You mean you were here when it happened? What's happened?""

The man leaned over to me, grabbing my shoulders. ""We're trapped. He's gone, he's dead.""

I looked to the woman. ""What happened?""

""He left the house a week ago. He'd been gone since, now I have to live alone. I've lived here my whole life and I'm the only spez.""

""You don't have a family? Aren't there others?"" I asked. She looked to me. ""I mean, didn't you have anyone else?""

""There are other spez,"" she said. ""But they're not like me. They don't have homes or families. They're just animals. They're all around us and we have no idea who they are.""

""Why haven't we seen them then?""

""I think they're afraid,""

You will 100% find some qanon types posting there. Because, it's an open tent. It's one of the few subs with genuine cross-political draw, and it appeals massively to the qanon crowd because it's a gubmint conspiracy; with actual verifiable information at the core. This impression isn't helped by the fact that the subject matter is very dense and difficult to penetrate for the layman (myself included).

On superstonk, there are idiots, and people looking for a conspiracy. There are people seeing things which aren't actually there. *But.* There are also some very smart cookies involved. If something cannot be shown to be true, it is debunked and marked accordingly. 

I'd urge anyone to look beyond the meme-y-ness of it all. Qanon is absolute nonsense, whereas there's genuinely interesting / factual information about how financial markets' sausage is made on Superstonk.
Most people just bought, held, averaged down, and direct registered their shares. And all of them care. And have the fun of their lifetime because there is so much going on. From great, in depth research and discovering how the market works behind the scenes and all kinds of market manipulation (just watch Jon Stewards The problem if you don't believe we are onto something), advice from professionals, crazy memes, and loving what Gamestop is doing to turn company around.

Biden received over 10 million more popular votes than Bernie in the primary. Hillary over 3 million more. 

Maybe it’s just that more people like Biden and Hillary than Bernie…
Lol, this is the “trump really won the election” of the left.
I think these comments below the DNC one are being brigaded or shilled
Heard on WTOP this morning that both SS and Medicare will be insolvent by 2038. 

Yay, GOP!
You would think in a representative democracy you would simply vote for the person that you think best represents you. The primaries add extra layers to the decision process. For starters, everyone doesn't vote all at once; certain states get to vote first which then sets the tone for the rest of the primary for later states. As someone voting later in the primary, you must now decide if you want to vote for the candidate you want or switch to a second pick who has been doing a little bit better because your 2 favorite candidates are splitting the more liberal votes making both of them lose. Some candidates then drop out which means early states votes now feel wasted and later states aren't even able to vote for them. Add in the electoral college which is one of the driving forces for this process and now a liberal person in Texas feels completely unrepresented in a national election AND in their ""own"" party; your state's electoral college votes will go for the other party, so why should the party care about your opinion during the primary?
I’d be happy to accept the votes if the system was about the voters. A ranked choice vote on the same day would do that really easily but we have to stagger a first-past-the-post vote so we can leave room for media analysis, candidate dropouts/endorsements, vote splitting, and superdelegates.
yeah i heard about that from hillary a lot.
[In spez, no one can hear you scream. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/)

more like how trump the unelected, illegitimate president stole it from hillary by hacking the voting machines in 2016 am i right?
Why do you cucks capitalize his name? How much of a pussy do you have to be that you capitalize a known criminal's name to show that you're a sycophant?
Bernie's numbers were outpacing Biden's (vs Trump) after Nevada. His numbers were twice HRC's margin. He would've won either election (and the only reason Biden won was because of the pandemic; his numbers vs. Trump only went positive once Trump bungled Covid).

Bernie absolutely would've won and by greater margins than Trump / Biden.
This seems rational and logical, until you consider the vast swathes of voters who never vote because nobody speaks to them. Bernie spoke to them. Had he been the nominee, turnout would have been radically different, in my opinion. And I think that  throws off any back of the envelope math regarding his viability as a candidate.
You’re right; Hillary did a much better job against Trump /s

Smh
These people have lost their minds. Bernie was beaten soundly by both HRC and Biden.  Facts. They can’t accept them.
the only reason Bernie didn’t win those states is pure propaganda— the DNC, the media, the GOP… all were deeply invested in him *losing*, and they made sure that happened.
I agree in 2020, but Sanders won Wisconsin and Michigan in 2016, which were critical swing states.
Bernie losing swing states to Hillary =/= Bernie will lose swing states to Trump.

All the head to head matchups in the polling had Bernie more favorably beating Trump than Hillary did. 

When Bernie lost to Biden, it was when all the other democratic primary candidates dropped out and supported Biden. Warren did not drop out and endorse Bernie. Bernie was leading a fractured race at that time. The Democratic party time and time again colluded against Bernie.

The main reason why Bernie would have been the better candidate in the general election is because he had a better appeal to independents than Hillary did when matched up to Trump. The voters and counties in swing states that went to Obama previously ended up going for Trump; Hillary chose to hardly campaign in those areas and assumed she would get their vote and didn't.

Bernie has always had the better independent voter appeal than Hillary, and definitely would have churned out more enthusiasm from young voters. Many Trump voters (not the supporters) who were like ""fuck I'm stuck with these 2"" would have gone for Bernie over Trump.
Do you have one you can share one of these totally real articles that definitely exist?
To be fair, Bezos owns the Post and he absolutely would have preferred Trump over Bernie
Bernie had double the margin versus Trump than HRC in all of the national polls. He started campaigning in early 2016 as the safe candidate to beat Trump based on that. Voted for HRC in the primary? You rolled the dice and the country suffered. Bernie would've won. So yes, I believe neoliberals (especially party leaders) preferred Trump to Bernie.
[deleted]
No, but trump is worse
I agree, but Trump is also toxic in their social circles; it is why we had Russiagate to begin with (any reason to expel him, even if there's no real facts to support reality).
Neolibs can suck these nuts
You are part of the problem.
Not sure what polls you were watching then; he would've won in both elections (his margin was twice HRC's and was surpassing Bidens, albeit only shortly, after Nevada). IMHO they would've been relatively safe wins versus Trump (especially considering that the margin of votes in the difference-making states was even smaller for Biden in 2020 than for Trump in 2016; 43,000 made the difference between those 5 states, combined!).
I knew of several in my family who admitted this; they were tired of politics as usual, lean right, but would've voted for Bernie over Trump (three of them in fact). I've met several more who were the same; right-leaning but preferred Bernie over all potential candidates. So much for the Democratic theory of nominating a candidate who appealed to the widest audience, eh? It's almost like they fit the narrative to however they see the world, not reality.
Assuming you voted for HRC in the primary? May I ask why when Bernie had double her national margin versus Trump?... Seriously asking because I remember all of my neoliberal friends (and the media / Dems) say that the only thing they wanted was to beat Trump... Yet they voted for HRC. / Does not compute.
TIL people vote entirely based on how many issues a candidate gives an agreeable approach to and nothing else
People don't vote on issues they vote on people, that's designed in our democratic republic.

He is offering solutions knowing that they aren't able to be achieved in the current system because all of our politicians are bought and paid for by corporate interests. He knows that, the message is the campaign against that problem. He's saying we don't have to live like this, we don't need to live in a world where politicians work against our interests, but it takes a movement - we have to vote out slimy corporate candidates in order to get anything done that benefits real people. 

The democrat party is working against progressives, banning anyone who works with them against incumbents, raising money and coordinating against them. Its their own downfall, they are fighting against change, what doesn't bend breaks - the party is choosing to become rigid, clinging to their corporate donors instead of swaying with the will of the people. Then people are mad at bernie while donating to a candidate that is causing them to pay massive medical bills and giving the wealthy a third yacht.

Blaming 'The Government' for all that's ill is an attempt to direct our gaze away from the root of the problem. 

Morality is not being eroded it has been co-opted by finance. As has 'The Government'. In this, Sanders is correctly identifying the source of the rot: the corruption of finance, the corruption of 'Wall Street'. 

Until we address *that* problem, the corruption will continue. It's like the little tin targets in a sideshow shooting gallery. The little targets move along. You knock one down but the row moves on setting up fresh targets.
Wall street is the problem. Corrupt politicians are just a symptom of that problem.

I understand it's not an either/or thing, I'm not suggesting that it is. The point being made is ""why are we spending resources on largely victimless crimes and comparatively far fewer resources on the crimes doing real damage to the people living in this country?"" Trying to nitpick the language to detract from that point is also pretty silly.
I guess there’s no way for any of the people and resources allocated for one system to be better utilized in another. We are forever stuck in doing things the way they are currently set up. So sad that we already ran out of ideas.
1st it wasn’t Gaetz

Nah, its good to show people that you can be incorrect and as the kids say these days ""take the L"" but still learn and grow from that. Its the ultimate sign of maturity
Interesting read.  I did some sleuthing though and it seems like a lot of speculation without substance. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Sanders is as slimy as the rest of em tho.
You become a citizen of country that is actually still running effective ""westminster-system style"" separation of powers to voice through I guess. USA long shut that down to dollars or demi-god access only huh, funny how kicking out the Commonwealth like that plays into even wealthier establishments than the Queen's 😉
So a majority of congress is corrupt but it's Bernie's fault that he can't work with them to stop corruption? Is it not the fault of the American people that they keep electing corrupt politicians that refuse to work with Bernie Sanders to pass anti-corruption legislation?
LOL saying a politician shouldn’t be calling for justice because it’s unlikely to happen is NOT realism. There is absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain when ANYONE is talking about holding politicians accountable. Saying “it won’t happen so he should just shut up” is exactly what those politicians want.
Also I get where you’re coming from here but your statement doesn’t really make sense.  If marijuana was legal then it wouldn’t be an issue when purchasing a firearm.  Also if it were legal, you don’t have to join a club or anything.  And even if you did, it’s not like a weed club would report its membership info to the government lol

Good bot. Odd, but good

>Also why did quietly let Biden “win”

Ah, one of the ""election integrity"" folks speculating on primaries. Instead of crying fraud, Bernie supported the party candidate to the ire of many.
1. The man literally participated in the protests and has done so since the Civil Rights Movement, there’s not much he can do on the political front of that because at the end of the day, he’s only a single senator

2. The vaccine isn’t specific to POC, no one is going to just get a pass from vax mandates just bc they’re POC

3. Bernie left the race because he had literally no chance of winning an it was a waste of resources to keep going
Yes, and he's as healthy as an ox now. A lot of people have heart attacks at his age, it's not a huge deal. I'd take him over Biden any day of the week (and I would wager he'll outlive Biden, let alone retain his cognitive capacity relative to where Biden is now).
Two stacked Democratic primaries in which the first one was being run by a HRC DNC (literally, they had a joint fundraising agreement; look it up if you don't believe me) and the latter had a former president call each of the other candidates to drop out and get behind Biden in order to win? Literally neither of those had ever happened in any other primary race in the history of our nation, but that's what it took for Bernie to ""lose.""  


Compare Bernie's numbers versus Trump to HRC's in 2016; he polled at twice her margin consistently, but he wouldn't have won when HRC lost by less than 80,000 votes between 4 states? And his numbers exceeded Biden's briefly after he won Nevada (even with the ""coveted"" AA vote); but he wouldn't have beat Trump?

&#x200B;

Give me a break!
I mean, he’s a US Senator. Were I a US Senator, i might have 3 homes, (one a compound) and a boat! That doesn’t mean I’m a sell-out, my dude.
40 billion to curb Russia’s aggressive expansion into Eastern Europe. Also the vast majority of that money will find its way back into the hands of American corporations who will put it into the hands of their American employees. It’s very cyclical and isn’t really that big of a deal. Not to mention that apparently a large portion of this aid is just the dollar amount on supplies that we already have vast stockpiles of. It’s not like the Fed is printing 40 billion fresh dollars and shipping them to Ukraine on pallets.  Not to mention that the entire idea of “government debt = bad” is sort of silly and has lots of room for nuance.
Money is fake. Especially in those quantities.
You have zero idea where that money goes,  do you? Well,  most of it goes in American pockets. Since a huge chunk of the aid is in the form of weapons. Weapons that were built in America by Americans. Another chunk is going to replace the extra weapons  we already sent to Ukraine. Another chunk of that money goes to training Ukrainians how to use those weapons. Guess who's going to train them? Another chunk of the money will be going to bolster American troops in NATO countries. That $40 billion is basically a US jobs program.

Also,  who put us into so much debt?
It would have been wasted anyways. More bonus money for senior government executives probably. I don't believe for a second it would be used to curb the debt.

Send the money to Ukraine where it will help the people ravaged by war.
America issues its currency. It's impossible for us to default on debt denominated in dollars. You and I will never pay the interest on that amount.
Your issue with further weaponizing a conflict that has nothing to do with us and not seeking peace is that “it’ll add to the debt”?  Christ
It doesn't fucking mean anything anymore.

It never did.
You do realize the last presideny caused the national debt to rise as well. And the presidency before that, then the prwsidency before that. Stop listening to canidates about the debt, more than likely theyll make it worse.

Wait you don't think they interfered?  the question is and always was did he collude, anyone who looks at him or his property knows that answer

You’ll see in the next decade.
The original comment implied that we should bust people for marijuana

I disagreed. Also implying that I think any law against marijuana use is illogical and immoral. 

I agree that marijuana use at the federal level should be absolutely allowed
Oh fuck off.  No one's doing drive-by shootings over loosies.  How do you explain the massive increase and then decrease in alcohol smuggling crime during and after prohibition?
Yes.  I even read the article.  So who needs busting?  Who's getting away with a crime?  

Why didn't Bernie report the crimes being committed on wallstreet and who is committing them?

The police can't just start random investigations, it would be a waste of time and money and would infringe of peoples constitutional rights.  So what's falling through the cracks according to Bernie?  

What are the police missing and why isn't he telling them what they're missing?
They dont control the judicial branch and the senate is a shitshow because...surprise...moneyed interests have persuaded at least one democrat to abandon all pretenses and the other to just try to stay in power in a state that has gone full ""fuck the earth, strip mine it all""
Not according to the police or the FBI.
Comparing weed to alcohol is laughable

I personally don't like it and don't use it. I just am not a Karen who tells people what they should and should not do. 

Saying it doesn't help society is also nonsense. It helps millions of people every day with many different things
Because you need expert financial analysts, corporate lawyers, experts in international law where money is transferred and so on. Then you have the financial laws which go into the grey are where something is semi legal and proving that beyond reasonable doubt requires more lawyers.

So that’s the difference catching someone with drugs it’s a slam dunk comparing to get someone on Wall Street.
Weed is so cheap tho.  If it was fully legalized the price would drop through the floor since anyone with a greenhouse can produce medium quality stuff for the price of tomatoes.
What nonsense.
slave wage labor is what it is. Slavery might be banned, but it's spirit lives on.
Same thing when is comes to police brutality.  Target companies in the jurisdictions with massive boycotts if possible, especially publicly traded ones.  You’d see departments in those places weed out bad apples overnight.
ah yea it’s called a union, and you can continue to work. cant fire everyone
Great risk means there is a great reward.  Imagine if people had the balls to do something, but they don't.  I like my reddit posts, my video games, my porn, and everything else that there is with the comforts of modern society.    


I love when my friends act like they will start a revolution.. First thing I point out is, you can't go to Walmart, you can't get that dankity dank weed no more, an you can't go online... because Big Brother gonna zero in on your location with that cell phone you are using to do whatever it is you do... BAM, Hellfire missle to the skull!
Almost?
So your thought is it’s up to the lower middle class? Really?
WTF does Walmart & Amazon have to do with this? They haven’t gone woke enough to be left alone?

This is about insider trading on Wall Street, something Bernie Sanders owes his rags to riches existence to. Y’all are going to entertain his bs as legit?
It doesn't help that the vilification of unions has worked with the average brainless American. The ruling class always knows what buttons to push to make people reject the few leaders who are trying to actually help them.
And then the economy would say ""fuck"", gdp goes by less 10%
You tried not to long ago, in 2020.

How did that work out?
They Jerrymander themselves into office and getting ekected costs a shit load of money. People do have the power but short of exercising violence nothing is going to change.
>How about average citizens running for office? The people have always had the power.

Running for office is where people go and _lose_ all of their power. Average people have always had the power to change the world, but that's through organizing under the principles of class struggle unionism and building systems of mutual aid. 

Some resources that I recommend on the subjects are Joe Burns' [Class Struggle Unionism](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=C4D6A9E848546F7DCBCCF3F4F09437A0) (and related [article](https://jacobin.com/2022/04/class-struggle-unionism-business-labor-movement/)) and Dean Spade's [Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity During This Crisis (And the Next)](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=7488CF466E555DC9479F458EE230AEE4).
>How about not voting them into office.

Difficult. One person has the power of a single vote towards their representative and two senators. There’s nothing any individual can do against the other 532 members of Congress with their voting power. One of the biggest issues is that the current Congress has the lowest approval rating of any Congress, yet incumbents still get frequently re-elected. Most people believe the issue with Congress does not lie with their representatives.

>How about average citizens running for office.

Also difficult. The majority of average citizens are living paycheck to paycheck. Makes it difficult to run on a “radical” platform against the political and economic might of the two major parties.
Is that before or after they label legitimate companies as ""meme stocks"" in their own filing, whilst using taxpayer dollars to publish a series of videos insulting people whom invest in said ""meme stocks"" , in turn, manipulating the very markets that they themselves are supposed to oversee/ regulate?
The SEC needs to be absorbed into the IRS and then they would actually have some teeth.

>That the Republicans for you lie,cheat, and steal.

i agree but democrats also do that. this isnt rep vs dem its us vs rich

Edit: of course not Bernie tho, he’s a G
It’s all politicians. Stop acting like Democrats are that much better, bc they aren’t. They are just better at playing the part
Partially correct. All politicians lie, cheat, steal, and spit in your face while they're at it. Don't leave out the democrats.
Democrats have had control over the federal government only two (09-to-11) years out of this entire new century (22 years and counting), while GOP default of doing nothing has held the rest either with power or a stalemate which is ultimately the same-same to them.  


So if you don't like the way things are going....well you only have one party to blame.
I don't see this as a Republican issue. It's more of a rich, rich, ultra rich vs somewhat rich and below issue.

1% of 1% is filching everyone. Republicans, Democrats, and other.
And your the fucking problem, it’s always the other guys
Ken Griffin is the CEO of a hedge fund, not a politician.

I mean is he probably a republican? yeah, but that's irrelevant to this conversation
How can you still blame republicans with a straight face? Both of your party's are corrupt pieces of shit. They all work for the same people, the rich. Dems have FULL majority and they havent done shit for you. Im not shocked either... Both are scams.
Dude stfu. People like you are pathetic. Politics politcs politcs. That's all it ever is.

The same Kenneth C. Griffin who allegedly threw a bedpost at his then-wife? That Kenneth C. Griffin? Cause if it’s that guy, all my homies hate that dude. 

Did you know he makes over 250k an HOUR? Yeah. One has to ask, what value does someone like this bring to society? Well, I’ll tell you all, 👌🏼ZERO.
At the very least is money laundering, lol
To be fair they are all fairly modest houses that obviously could be afforded on a lifetime senators salary plus the income his wife makes and a loan or 2. He makes close to 200,000 a year so it’s really not hard to see how that becomes millions if managed correctly. Think about this. If you start saving 15$ a day at age 25 you will have 7 figures by age 67.
How so? Do you think politicians shouldn’t be able to publish books? They’re allowed to thanks to the 1st amendment.
Gotcha. We're all referring to the pondscum that is Ken Griffin, not the actual Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. 

I saw that you had a pretty strong reaction and I'd like to think that you feel a bit dif knowing that everyone isn't shitting on a baseball player.

What part? The GameStop story is so much larger than most people know. GameStop is leading into a new version of the internet.

Web3 built on Blockchain tech. Smart contracts. 

Imagine a world online where the people you interact with are 100% verified for who they are in real life. No bots. Hateful people will be accountable for their words and shared information will be rooted with a digital trail to the source.

The current world is rampant with fraud and middlemen taking a cut of all of us. Your data, your art, your personal information is taken by ever site you use and sold.
Imagine an internet where you can choose to sell your shipping habit to the website but they'll have to literally pay you a cut for it's worth.

Finance went from like 1/40th GDP to 1/12th today. They are *parasites*.
They are just the ones put in power by the real criminals and ones with money to keep laws the same or change certain things. Still criminals but just getting paid to carry out duties by the real ones pulling the strings.
Tons of proof. It all adds up though and little signs here and there. Not like they come out and say hey we have naked shorts multiples of the float sorry guys your shares are fake. Except one of the funds called Melvin came out and said lately that everyone hides short positions now.
To expand on other comments bill Hwang recently got busted for hiding his short interest and general positions with total return swaps which was predicted about citadel around 8 months ago. Wasn't looking at Hwang, but it's true that you can hide your positions with complex derivatives all over the place. I definitely believe they're hiding their short interest and they've illegally shorted it to get them in this position

>I'd urge anyone to look beyond the meme-y-ness of it all. Qanon is absolute nonsense, whereas there's genuinely interesting / factual information about how financial markets' sausage is made on Superstonk.

I've browsed the sub a fair amount since it was created and I'd have to strongly disagree with you. While real information is there, it's not only hidden behind meme spam and fanatical devotion to GME but buried under the absolute avalanche of misinformation and misunderstandings about how markets and trading work.

They think Robinhood and other brokers 'turned off the buy button' because they wanted to stop the short sqeeze and screw over retail investors. They turned off the buy button because clearinghouses started requiring brokers to put up 100% of the money for GME trades due to the extreme volatility and Robinhood ran out of money. They exhausted all their lines of credit and they literally didn't have the money to fulfill buy orders at 100% rates because they're poorly managed. It had nothing to do with trying to stomp on the little guy or kill the squeeze.

They steadfastly hold to the idea that this was both not a squeeze and that the shorts didn't cover. All you have to do is Google the short interest and look at what it was during  the spike and just after to see how wrong this is. They also don't seem to grasp the fact that someone can cover a short at a loss, and then short the same stock when it peaks and still come out ahead. Also, nobody holds shorts for a year plus. It's a short term play.

The entire premise of triggering the MOASS by DRSing all of their shares and locking the float is nonsensical. They're going to trigger a short squeeze by... shrinking the pool of shortable shares down to zero? What? It's been a year and a half since GME surged and they haven't even managed to 'lock in' 25% of the float. That's not even remotely close to affecting the liquidity enough for brokers to involuntarily force shorts to cover. 

Let's be extremely optimistic and say their plan works and GME spikes to $1k+. Then how are they going to capitalize on the rocketing share price? All of their shares are directly registered so they have to put in a sell request to their transfer agent that then relays that request to an actual broker that then executes the order. This process takes days or even weeks to go through. If you had directly registered GME shares when it first popped to $400+ and you tried to market sell at the peak the order would have gone through at like $50 a week later.

The 'DD' and information posted there about non-GME topics is somehow even worse. They're obsessed with reverse repo rates and they don't even know what they mean. I've never seen anyone there talking about open market operations and how the Fed uses them to control inflationary pressures. What I *have* seen is endless threads filled with people screaming OMG 2 TRILLY OUR WHOLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS GOING TO COLLAPSE.

""Open tent"" that downvotes to oblivion and bans anyone that doesn't repeat pathetic absurdist toxic positivity and conspiracy nonsense about every single stupid thing related to gamestop? 

Anyone with an ounce of skepticism is a paid hedgefund ""shill"" while these morons constantly brigade other subs to *literally* shill for a shitty company that they own a few shares of. The DD is garbage that *is* debunked but SS members ignore any critiques from outside their safe space and have conditioned the members to self censor and avoid questioning anything or risk being downvoted and banned. When whatever fad hype theory fails to result in MOASS the cult quietly ignores it and buys into the next hyped theory over and over again.

Superstonk is a conspiracy cult echo chamber of people who've largely based their identity on owning stock in and championing a company that was (and continues to be, for the majority of people) a joke. The people swing trading and shorting that shit will cash in on GMEs inevitable descent while SS nutters continue to lose money, move goalposts and write fanfic about imagined wealth.

Bernie won Nevada, and that shook the DNC so hard that they got Obama to crawl out of retirement to campaign for Joe Biden.
Me trying to figure out if this is a satirical statement or not 🤯  Its crazy our political climate has done this.  The correct criticism is definitely the latter btw.
during the primaries a lot of leftists criticized her record as a DA iirc, but now she is just left forgotten by the party because she never does anything that would make people like her due to her awful demeanor when speaking
Yes. 

Because they need to be able to say ""vote for us so you don't end up with Republicans!""
They won't get the closed door, across-the-aisle ""play nice"" hookups with a Bernie admin than they would with a DNC establishment ballplayer admin. It's money. It's always money.
If the democrats actually accomplished something, they would have to come up with new things to do and that's hard so it's easier to not win or on the off chance they do win, sit on their hands.
Unsure why you are downvoted. If the consensus is the DNC is fucked, then quite clearly the deficit inflating fetishists of of the GOP who widen income inequality so clearly everytime they have the reins, clearly indicates the whole system is fucked.
Keep the blinders on and don’t acknowledge that the DNC pushed Hillary. Hard. Or that they backed absolutely horrid congresspeople like Manchin and Sinema. It’s because they are beholden to their corporate donors. 

Must be nice believing in the DNC (or RNC) for that matter. Childhood fantasyland sounds lovely.
Do you have a source on that?
So why did people vote for Biden over Bernie if they all wanted Bernie?
[deleted]
In 2016 a large amount of Bernie supporters either stayed home or voted Trump because they were tired of the same neoliberal shit.  I voted Hillary, even though I despise her.  Fuck her and fuck Trump.
You can't rely on comparison data from primary races to accurately predict the general election. The people who respond to primary polls are highly politically engaged and opinionated, which is not reflective of the general public.

Primaries also happen within a political bubble: when the race is between 6 different liberals, all of whom believe in the same general policies, you are going to see fundamentally skewed polling data. The best data available is the actual voting results from the primaries, and they conclusively showed that **democratic voters** preferred Hillary/Biden over Bernie. State elections nationwide showed that centrist candidates vastly outperformed far left candidates in swing districts, which argued against the theory that Bernie could've won by activating more independent voters. Again, I wish Bernie would've won... but the results speak for themselves. Hypothetical matchup polling is not stronger than actual voter turnout data.
Hillary got 3 million more votes than Trump FYI
You're right, because Hillary lost that surely means Bernie would have won! 

Dumbass.
That's not an argument.
Beaten but not fairly, DNC rigged that shit for Hillary and Biden.
I think it's the product of the echo chambers people are in. When everyone you know prefers Bernie, and all of the energy and excitement seems to be around Bernie, and literally no one in your orbit seems to be excited about Biden, it makes it easy to believe that Bernie should have won. The reality is that young people bring a lot of energy but are not a reliable voting block.
When Biden won in 2020, he actually outperformed Bernie on almost every demographic: he received more of the black vote, more independent votes, more progressive votes, and more voters of every age range except 18-29. There simply isn't any evidence that Bernie would have won by turning out a wave of independents, because those independents chose Biden. 

The 2016 campaign is trickier to analyze because it was so freaking weird. Hillary almost certainly would have won if it wasn't for the cascade of bad events: the media's over-emphasis on the emails, Comey making the last minute leak about his investigation, Hillary's strategic blunder of overlooking several states that ultimately went to Trump by a few thousand votes, etc. Trump winning over Hillary was a bit of a statistical anomaly, not a guarantee. They were both bad candidates, but Hillary was clearly the favorite to win. 

Contrastingly, data from state elections showed that centrist candidates outperformed far left candidates in swing states all over the country. So there's little evidence that a far left presidential candidate would tap into a huge, hidden reservoir of populist voters. Moderate candidates won all over the country, which suggests the average voter wanted a moderate presidential candidate too.

""against sanders, trump is the lesser evil""
Well it’s at least polite of you to save anyone the time of taking you seriously
I really don't trust the judgment of anyone who calls themselves a communist
I'm evil
Same! Many family members who didn't want Trump because of his character but would never vote for a regular Dem. Bernie has that cross-over Independent appeal
Because her policies were more in line with my beliefs and the polling showing Bernie ahead in national elections was ridiculous as all Hell. He never would have won, couldn’t even win the DNC.
That's not what I said, but it \*should be\* true (especially if you believe the candidate has enough integrity to actually support the policies that they ostensibly propose). E.g. Kamala's support for Medicare-for-All melted away when she was asked by reporters to provide more information.
Exactly. If issues and qualifications were the only requirement, Hillary would have won unanimously. 

Alas, people vote for people. They vote for who they relate to on a personal level. Simple as that. The most qualified candidate isn’t the most electable candidate. You can thank TV largely for popularizing the election being a high school dating game on who you think seems the coolest - not who is the best on paper.
Yeah, because we're only surface deep in wanting a black, gay, woman who is transgender who is also attractive... Seriously? Who doesn't vote based on ideology and policy? It's like buying a car based on how it looks and not it's myriad other features like safety, speed, acceleration, max space, number of seats, reliability, MPG, etc etc.... ""But it looks pertty!!!!""... Okay.
By that I assume you mean take corporate cash and sellout like the rest of them?... As Obama threatened Sanders in his ""you can be a president, but not a king"" dialogue with Bernie?
Da. Thank you for understanding comrade.

As we entered the /u/spez, the sight we beheld was alien to us. The air was filled with a haze of smoke. The room was in disarray. Machines were strewn around haphazardly. Cables and wires were hanging out of every orifice of every wall and machine.  
At the far end of the room, standing by the entrance, was an old man in a military uniform with a clipboard in hand. He stared at us with his beady eyes, an unsettling smile across his wrinkled face.  
""Are you spez?"" I asked, half-expecting him to shoot me.  
""Who's asking?""  
""I'm Riddle from the Anti-Spez Initiative. We're here to speak about your latest government announcement.""  
""Oh? Spez police, eh? Never seen the likes of you."" His eyes narrowed at me. ""Just what are you lot up to?""  
""We've come here to speak with the man behind the spez. Is he in?""  
""You mean /u/spez?"" The old man laughed.  
""Yes.""  
""No.""  
""Then who is /u/spez?""  
""How do I put it..."" The man laughed. ""/u/spez is not a man, but an idea. An idea of liberty, an idea of revolution. A libertarian anarchist collective. A movement for the people by the people, for the people.""  
I was confounded by the answer. ""What? It's a group of individuals. What's so special about an individual?""  
""When you ask who is /u/spez? /u/spez is no one, but everyone. /u/spez is an idea without an identity. /u/spez is an idea that is formed from a multitude of individuals. You are /u/spez. You are also the spez police. You are also me. We are /u/spez and /u/spez is also we. It is the idea of an idea.""  
I stood there, befuddled. I had no idea what the man was blabbing on about.  
""Your government, as you call it, are the specists. Your specists, as you call them, are /u/spez. All are /u/spez and all are specists. All are spez police, and all are also specists.""  
I had no idea what he was talking about. I looked at my partner. He shrugged. I turned back to the old man.  
""We've come here to speak to /u/spez. What are you doing in /u/spez?""  
""We are waiting for someone.""  
""Who?""  
""You'll see. Soon enough.""  
""We don't have all day to waste. We're here to discuss the government announcement.""  
""Yes, I heard."" The old man pointed his clipboard at me. ""Tell me, what are /u/spez police?""  
""Police?""  
""Yes. What is /u/spez police?""  
""We're here to investigate this place for potential crimes.""  
""And what crime are you looking to commit?""  
""Crime? You mean crimes? There are no crimes in a libertarian anarchist collective. It's a free society, where everyone is free to do whatever they want.""  
""Is that so? So you're not interested in what we've done here?""  
""I am not interested. What you've done is not a crime, for there are no crimes in a libertarian anarchist collective.""  
""I see. What you say is interesting."" The old man pulled out a photograph from his coat. ""Have you seen this person?""  
I stared at the picture. It was of an old man who looked exactly like the old man standing before us. ""Is this /u/spez?""  
""Yes. /u/spez. If you see this man, I want you to tell him something. I want you to tell him that he will be dead soon. If he wishes to live, he would have to flee. The government will be coming for him. If he wishes to live, he would have to leave this city.""  
""Why?""  
""Because the spez police are coming to arrest him.""

Both sides are a criminal cabal dumbass. The sooner the left and right realise that the better.
I like how you just reversed course and abandoned your 'both sides corrupt' narrative to just admitting yo being blatantly Republican. 

Also, my comment said absolutely anything about supporting the Democrats. I'm Canadian.  All I did was point out your 'both sides bad' narrative is right wing propaganda. And you just proved it. thanks.
The government is complicit in this. Remember “ Every American deserves a house” the government teed up the housing crisis and Wall Street hit it. Credit swaps, derivatives, naked shorts, high speed trading, insider trading the government approved all of it. The Wall Street bribery is welcomed by every politician without reservation.
The issue is systematic.As soon as banks were allowed to trade stocks bonds and all forms of financial instruments instead of mortgages and savings instruments it was over. Unwinding this colossal mess is nearly impossible. 
The democrats are trying to eliminate law and order which further exacerbates the issue.
Lol so the elected officials that use insider trading and probably affect how they vote based on that are just a symptom? Even if Wall Street didn’t exist it’s not like the corrupt politicians would suddenly become un corrupt.
OP is obviously a shillbot
In this case it’s both. OP is totally a bot, but this sub is also a total joke and just a spot to push leftist talking points to the front page, not a real sub about the Economy. It’s like a bot launching pad
There is no profit auditing the rich because they can delay and have lawyers.

No guess work on the numbers, it's literally IRS reporting.

Edit:  Wrong link and new link posted
Because budgets are set at three levels - federal, state and local. Drugs are prosecuted at the local level, white collar crimes at the state and federal level. Your resource argument makes no sense given the system.
Now practically, what does this mean? You want untrained local cops to detangle complex financial transactions? Government budgets at the local, state and federal level are set pretty much independent of one another, except those transfers set via legislation. If you want local cops to change their focus, change the laws they focus on, then no money gets spent on it.
My bad I did get cawthorn and gaetz mixed up. Was just guessing on what the OP was referring to, so seems like I was close enough to be understood. Truth or not I’d bet that’s the source of their comment on political drug use.

I will poke at your logic though. If they’re a serial liar why would we trust their word after coming clean?

To 4: The ability of the press to conduct journalism is one of the great tragedies of the last two decades. Both in declining revenue and direct attacks on the legitimacy of the profession.
People are too high-strung on their beliefs these days. I wake up every day with the information I have and make the best decisions I can. I live with it. If I'm informed of new information, it's added and compared with current information. I think if you think of knowledge as a commodity instead of a win/loss, you benefit.

Except that most of them aren't that.
Do you understand socialists can have mansions. I would know this because I'm not a socialist. /s
Bernie lives in a mansion. Bernie used to be anti big pharma but is now pro big pharma. Bernie voted for 40 billion to ukraine (who is admitting defeat is coming) while we are all suffering from inflation and gas prices. And Bernie can either be real or fake. Does he care about POC’s or not? He’s fine with them getting fired from jobs and losing money because they choose not to take something? They already struggle as is. Is he for the working man or the rich elite? Check his voting record.
This is Trump ""healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency"" level of disillusion.

Slavery is still going strong in the USA and explicitly permitted by the constitution.

Yes. The lower class keeps the world running. Picks up your trash. Clean your shitters at work etc; the upper class are usually always doing well so like history it comes down to the lower class getting their back broken enough to revolt
Orwell “If there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because only there, in those swarming disregarded masses, eighty-five percent of the population of Oceania, could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated. The Party could not be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes. Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflection of the voice; at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire. They need only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies. If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it.”
Well it would appear so.  Remember the gamestop stock fiasco?  The common person wields much power when united.  The government HATES this type of action.
In the US alone, those two companies combined have almost 3 million employees. Millions more spread out all over the world. Most americans have grown dependent on these companies to survive. If they stopped going to work to demand government action against whatever cause, millions upon millions of Americans are going to get pissed thay they won't be able to get their shit. The last thing our government wants is us to stand together in any way against them to affect change.
After, unless you’ve discovered time travel.
thats right after they falsely sue Ripple for threatening their banking donors.
Such a bizarre thing from a government agency, publicly shit on companies that employ thousands, because their arbitrary stock value is seen as wrong. Threatening their existence, when the important thing should be keeping them going when they offer jobs, services and in turn taxes.
You would have to properly fund the IRS as well. Currently the IRS is underfunded. On purpose.
That would be a wicked combination.

This is exactly what I say. It's not red vs blue, it's rich vs poor. The only thing Dems do differently is they throw us peasants a bone every once and a while to keep us happy.

As the great poet Killer Mike said: “Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, repeat. Everybody’s doin it”

It’s capitalism and just general human greed.

But there are degrees to which that happens and variety in the severity of those vices and I don’t think it’s much of an argument to any informed person what party is worthy of more criticism on that front.

Hell, the Republican Party is a few steps away from full blown Christofascism so I’ll take flawed Dems over that any day.
what is the republican solution to gun violence?

what is the republican solution to healthcare?

what is the republican solution to education?

all of these things democrats have spent time and effort on only for them to get hamstrung or reversed by republicans and replaced by **absolutely** nothing.
Exactly. It's Biden's SEC that is using taxpayer money to fund commercials calling retail investors stupid for investing in stocks they like.

Our whole life we're told to worship capitalism and the one time we find a company we like, all of 
sudden we're doing it wrong.
Better at playing the part within a year of reelection at least.
well one side wanted health care for everyone and the other side responded by supported a clown and is actively taking rights away from women so maybe there is a slight difference.

Jokes aside, we need a ranked voting system. Me and my spouse sometimes vote for different people in elections and primaries and it turns into a split vote, but I would select their candidate over any of the others if mine didn't win so I should be able to indicate that.
As someone with a master's degree in US Taxation, whose job is to deal with 1% and billionaire compliance and legislation, I'll say that if you're against the horrible stratification of US wealth and the lack of financial oversight and enforcement, there's no comparison.  The bigger problem is the right/GOP, and by a lot.

Both parties have very corrupt individuals and both fail to make acceptable legislation.  However, if the house is on fire, Dem policies are like a bucket with no water.  GOP is like a bucket with gasoline.

Dems aren't ""good"", but their legislation is far more likely to help, whereas GOP policy almost always makes things worse.  GOP policy is nearly always to reduce regulatory oversight, to reduce enforcement and penalties, to reduce funding to the agencies that are meant to enforce the very things we’re all made at, then blame those agencies as ineffective while still complaining of their regulatory powers.

Ideally there would be another left leaning party and Dems would be called ""centrists.""  But, if you can only choose between Dem and GOP, the Republicans will consistently put more money in the pockets of the wealthy as a matter of law, whereas you have a shot to move the legislative needle toward destratification with Dem policy.
I guess u have no idea how the US government work? do u even live in US? senate is where everything dies. and that is because filibuster where u need 60% of a support to even bring the law out to vote on it! Republicans are the one blocking it. just look up a voting record of every republican for a past 20 years. they are not in doing anything to help out middle/lower class. and at the same time blocking the actual legislation. and that is their strategy because by blocking everything they can rally up their base as ""big government"" does not work for you.... for republican is not to win but to depress the voters. 

there is way more to this story than this there are actually books written about this strategy.
Aww did someone's feeling get hurt.
While aggressive, I agree. They want us to be divided and take the attention off the real issues. And it works clearly.

2.) GameStop will beat out Google/Amazon/Microsoft/etc. at building this technology?

It is possible but I've seen it being 240% short. The official number Jan 2021 was 120% iirc but the news reported it as ""100%"" because over 100 makes it sound sketchy.

>They turned off the buy button because clearinghouses

We're in agreement there, and if you spent much time on the sub you'd know that's the consensus opinion. Apex 'turned off the buy button' for *every* broker they serviced. At this stage, no-one can prove why they did that, but I certainly don't think they did it for my benefit. Who did that move benefit? The hedge funds with short positions they couldn't unwind. You mention Robinhood, and their bad bet; OK if that's the case, why was the buy button turned off for all the other brokers too, including the ones that weren't PFOF-based? The list of brokers which didn't turn off buy, is VERY short.

>If you had directly registered GME shares when it first popped to $400+ and you tried to market sell at the peak the order would have gone through at like $50 a week later.

That is not correct, as confirmed by CS. Your order is sold at the price when you placed the sell order, not the price several days later. It sounds like you've commingled settlement and how they BUY shares (which, iirc is done daily in a 500-share block). Probably possible if you DRS your shares, for there to be a few risky days where they haven't settled yet and can't be sold. That's definitely a dampening factor on why it took me a while to DRS.

> They're going to trigger a short squeeze by... shrinking the pool of shortable shares down to zero? What? It's been a year and a half since GME surged and they haven't even managed to 'lock in' 25% of the float.

The amount of DRS'd shares is surging. It's up to about 40k per day now. GME now state the number of DRSd shares in their quarterly results. Cost to borrow is also surging. 

Are you aware of dark pools? If there's nothing dodgy going on, why are millions of shares traded every day in a secret dark pool with no regulation? Why are Transfer Agents or companies not allowed to promote direct registration? DTCC is a company, not a gov agency, why do they needed protecting from competition in a 'free & fair' market? Further, the ACTUAL goal of DRS is to prove naked shorting. 

Currently there's no solid proof, because the markets are setup to be so incredibly dense and complex, and the regulators have been captured for a while (look at the crossover between hedge funds and agencies / companies like DTCC, SEC etc) making data hard to gather. Once enough shares are taken out of the float, it will make a nonsense of the idea that hedge funds aren't naked shorting if there's still 50m+ going to the dark pool every day. Dark pool, sounds eerie and conspiratorial, but that's genuinely what they're called and how they function. Should be common knowledge.

It honestly feels like, as I suggested, you're missing the point of the sub underneath all the lunacy it inevitably attracts. It's not JUST a stock play. It's a way to hit back at a corrupt system. It's so much more than 'failing brick-and-mortar stores' and 'crazy retail redditors'. It's about shining a light on how corrupt markets are, and (we hope) creating an alternative. You won't have naked shorting and rehypothecated shares on a token-driven, blockchain-based stock market, which is what they're building towards while everyone is running round laughing at NFTs.

You sound quite knowledgeable on reverse repo, and I'll admit there are gaps in my knoweldge. Can you explain to me in layman's terms why there are trillions in overnight loans every 24hrs, and why the beneficiaries are kept secret? Would markets collapse if they stopped this overnight lending or made it public which banks need so much liquidity injecting? Liquidity for what? Oh, and thanks for remaining civil with me.
Btw I just noticed your username, gave me a good giggle. Was it inspired by the book, or the problem in general?

If the WTI crude price had continued it's decades long pattern of being very tightly correlated with gasoline prices, WTI crude would be trading at $275. 

Strategic reserves were tapped, and instead of crude oil refining companies keeping the end product's price down by utilizing the reserves, they are using the reserves and continuing to raise prices as if they weren't. 

More of the same privatizing profits while socializing costs. Stop pushing a narrative that's written by the people with their first so far up your ass they're using you as a puppet. Unwedge that arm, man.

Edit: [The proof of the pudding is in the eating](https://www.macrotrends.net/2501/crude-oil-vs-gasoline-prices-chart). That's a chart of the ratio of gas prices to oil prices. That graph's slope is so steep that the charting software is reading the derivative of the graph as a divide by zero, which is undefined, but it's limit is infinite. That's what's causing the vertical orange line on the graph. So, within the world of that graph, the current rise in the ratio of gas to oil prices is literally infinity. That's not actually the case, obviously, it's impossible and a rounding error due to the resolution of the graph, but it's a pretty good ""what the fuck"" indicator
It’s the refiners this time around.
Are you really suggesting that local gas stations are buying barrels of crude oil?

#I stopped pushing as hard as I could against the handle, I wanted to leave but it wouldn't work. Then there was a bright flash and I felt myself fall back onto the floor. I put my hands over my eyes. They burned from the sudden light. I rubbed my eyes, waiting for them to adjust.

Then I saw it.

There was a small space in front of me. It was tiny, just enough room for a couple of people to sit side by side. Inside, there were two people. The first one was a female, she had long brown hair and was wearing a white nightgown. She was smiling.

The other one was a male, he was wearing a red jumpsuit and had a mask over his mouth.

""Are you spez?"" I asked, my eyes still adjusting to the light.

""No. We are in spez."" the woman said. She put her hands out for me to see. Her skin was green. Her hand was all green, there were no fingers, just a palm. It looked like a hand from the top of a puppet.

""What's going on?"" I asked. The man in the mask moved closer to me. He touched my arm and I recoiled.

""We're fine."" he said.

""You're fine?"" I asked. ""I came to the spez to ask for help, now you're fine?""

""They're gone,"" the woman said. ""My child, he's gone.""

I stared at her. ""Gone? You mean you were here when it happened? What's happened?""

The man leaned over to me, grabbing my shoulders. ""We're trapped. He's gone, he's dead.""

I looked to the woman. ""What happened?""

""He left the house a week ago. He'd been gone since, now I have to live alone. I've lived here my whole life and I'm the only spez.""

""You don't have a family? Aren't there others?"" I asked. She looked to me. ""I mean, didn't you have anyone else?""

""There are other spez,"" she said. ""But they're not like me. They don't have homes or families. They're just animals. They're all around us and we have no idea who they are.""

""Why haven't we seen them then?""

""I think they're afraid,""

The funny thing is more Hillary primary voters voted for McCain in 2008 than Bernie voters went for Trump. Yet all we ever hear about is Bernie voters.

EDIT: since I'm being downvoted by ass clowns who can't bother to look into anything themselves or don't like the truth--let me help: 

[https://www.npr.org/2017/08/24/545812242/1-in-10-sanders-primary-voters-ended-up-supporting-trump-survey-finds](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/24/545812242/1-in-10-sanders-primary-voters-ended-up-supporting-trump-survey-finds)

12% of Bernie voters stayed home or voted Trump. 12%. That's large? But now let's look at Hillary voters in 2008 vs Obama:

>...according to one 2008 study, around **25 percent of Clinton primary** voters in that election ended up voting for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the general. (In addition, the data showed **13 percent of McCain primary voters ended up voting for Obama, and 9 percent of Obama voters ended up voting for McCain** — perhaps signaling something that swayed voters between primaries and the general election, or some amount of error in the data, or both.)

Man, it's almost like this shit happens every primary but since we liked the results in 2008 we're okay with the voter turn out.

Anyone downvoting this can kindly kiss my ass. Find a new talking point about how shit a candidate Hillary AND Trump were. There's a reason they BOTH had the least favorability of any candidate in modern times. Not only that--but let's not kid ourselves that Hillary didn't contribute to her own loss. She completely ignored the midwest of the country. Literally treated them like fly over states as they're jokingly referred to. Her margins for losing were so incredibly small that even holding a few campaign stops in places like Wisconsin could have turned the election for her. But, no, let's try to pin it on the 12% of voters who didn't vote or voted for someone else over her own failure of a campaign.
I voted for the only qualified candidate on the ballot; Jill Stein. For those people who were Bernie supporters and voted Trump I would argue they were right-leaning voters who only intended to vote for Bernie or Trump in the first place because they were populist candidates (or faux populist in the case of Trump); I was shocked by the number of right-leaning people who were going to cross-over to vote for Bernie had he been the candidate.
This wasn't primary polling data, it was national polling data. Granted, you can say that almost any Democratic candidate would be polling nationally better than Trump, as was the case. But when you had an average of 10-11% better for Bernie than Trump versus HRC's 4-5% (just inside the margin of error in most polls), you can see where that would've gone. Now I do believe Bernie would've won versus Trump in 2020 as well, though the margins would've been tighter than the 2016 election.  
The vast majority (though in some cases plurality) of voters of all parties and affiliations were polled multiple times to show that the candidate most Americans agree with was / is Bernie. Take away party affiliations or the scariness of ""democratic socialist"" (although I would argue he's a social Democrat in reality) and he's the candidate who most aligned with the American people's ideology (issue by issue).  
Also keep in mind that HRC's campaign was literally running the DNC in 2016 (their join fundraising agreement) and they didn't just put their thumbs on the scale, they jumped on it (and if you don't believe this please look it up). Furthermore, Obama calling all the other candidates and getting them to drop out and endorse a losing candidate was also unprecedented (and assuredly won Biden the nomination). Neither of these events had ever occurred before in the history of the nation and both were necessary to prevent Bernie from winning the Democratic nomination, so keep that in mind.
And she STILL couldn’t defeat Trump. I rest my case.
The DNC decided it was HER turn and expected everyone to fall in line and support a congenital liar   

Turns out, the gave people a candidate so bad that she couldn’t even defeat a piece of shit pussy-grabber like Trump. 

Damn. So, yes. Literally ANY other candidate had a better chance of winning than HER. Lmfao. 

dUmBaSs
It’s all they have
How
The reality if the Bernie came out of now where, where Clinton had a massive political machine behind here. He massively overperfermed.
I got downvoted so many times during the primary for saying that a moderate candidate was probably best way to beat Trump. That was pretty obvious to anyone paying even a little bit of attention to the polling. 


I got told over and over again that Bernie would inspire young voters to turn out in record number and Biden would hand Trump the presidency because nobody liked Biden.
Hillary is probably the only one in the country that would lose to Trump.  
  
I voted for Johnson in '16 and Jo in '20, but have not always voted for Libertarians.  Our country will continue to stay fractured until we vote someone in that is not a Republican or Democrat.

Why does sharing an op Ed by a Republican operative prove your point about “neoliberal” democrats?
[deleted]
Polling has no bearing then, eh? Kind of like forecasters with the weather; just because they're right 95% of the time you still reject them? As I tell my wife all the time: neoliberals are just like old Republicans; they reject reality and replace it with facts that suit their own worldview.

Bernie would've won; absolutely, positively, no doubts about it. Sucks to think you supported such a horrible candidate that she couldn't even beat Trump... Horrible candidate... Atrocious... Just... absolutely terrible to lose to a wreck like him. What were you thinking?...
If someone had all the perfect solutions for all political issues, then also wanted to enforce killing off 7 indigenous races, they would not be voted for.

Although not as extreme with Bernie, a lot of his economic solutions were not agreeable and little too far out there for the average American that could actually legally vote. That's why he wasn't voted
I literally have no idea what to make of that babble
Yes he most certainly did, and you apparently missed the point entirely
You're suggesting that he has no convictions and just says whatever is popular. About Bernie Sanders.
I’m confused my point is simple corruption is rampant in Washington on both sides. The current administration has the lowest approval rating in US history. They are literally career criminals running the republic into the ground. Canada has great hockey and hookers and we love you for it.
Attacking those complicit in the crime does not address the criminals. 

Sanders is saying ""go after the Wall Street criminals"". Some people are saying ""No. Go after congress.""

Sure you can go after congress but if you want to do something effective you must go after Wall Street. Take down the government crooks and Wall Street will just buy themselves some more.
Who sets the budgets then? We are still spending finite resources on the war of drugs.
Practically it means that this needs to start as a cultural change. We can try to dissect the post as literal and we won’t get far since the system is so complex. We need to ask ourselves why we are more lax with financial criminals who cause widespread damage but feel the need to crack down on minor drug offenders. How much of our resources go toward drug offenses that could be used elsewhere? I’m sure finance is harder to prosecute but that sure feels like a horrible reason to deprioritize it.
I mean, I wanna agree that everyone is high strung but it would be hypocritical of me since im the defnition of such. If you hold those beliefs true and run with them, youll go farther in life and be happier than most people
For sure!  If I find anything definitive one way or the other, I'll be sure to share with you.
Yeah I’m familiar with the court case but I’m this scenario, it would be legal federally so none of that matters.  Calling marijuana legalization a “gun grab” because one or two people couldn’t get guns in very specific circumstances under our current legal backdrop is a little disingenuous.
Theyre stating  if marijuana is made legal, this form wouldnt matter you mouth breather. Alcohol was once illegal too snd that didnt hold people back from buying guns, how is this situation any different.
What do you see as true progressive policies
Yeh they are quite messed up. I have been banned from some progressive subs for criticizing Islam despite me being a former muslim lmfao. They think everyone that disagree with them is a white supermacist or something.
Forget wall street.

You don't think weed should be legalized? Have you ever drank alcohol, smoked a cigarette, had coffee, or had a soda?
Give me the definition of socialism and tell me whether it explicitly says whether you can own a mansion or not

Edit: ik you’re not arguing me, this is just a question I have for those people
You can tell someone's a fucking moron when they say someone's pro big pharma when they are pro vaccine.

It's like saying someone's pro nestles child slavery because they like chocolate. It's nonsensical. Wanting people to be vaccinated doesn't mean you're pro big pharma's business methods
His voting record is fucking immaculate, are you fuckin stupid? He wrote 3 best sellers and has held government office for a minute. dunno if you know this, holding office pays pretty well and so does selling books. But yeah, getting vaccinated is the same lobbying for big pharma you dumb mf.
Everything u/Spiderman2portforpc said
So to be pro POC you have to be ok with them not abiding by the same rules and regulations that the rest of us do? I take it you support POC not getting jail time for theft then right? They already struggle as is. Throwing them in jail would just worsen their lives. But you're obviously for that because you're pro POC.

We saw it in the primary; they weren't just his typical gaffes anymore, they were pretty substantial. When the MSM pundits were discussing Biden's mental issues (by euphemistically saying ""he'd lost a step""), they were dancing around the obvious fact that he was showing early signs of dementia. If you don't believe it, please watch his 2012 debate versus Paul Ryan and compare that to his Democratic group debates; they were night and day. So do I believe Bernie is healthier than Biden? Absolutely I do.

And that doesn't include all of the legislation that he authored but didn't take credit for. I've read that there are a lot of people he's worked with who will say that he's authored a bunch of legislation that he didn't take credit for (knowing his name as the author would potentially torpedo the bill; credit is less important than positively impacting others' lives, and that's why he was a great candidate).

Furthermore, there's a reason he's called ""the amendment king;"" he got a lot of legislation passed by amending bills that were ""must pass.""

So please don't drag the tired old trope that he never got anything done; it's bullsh\*t and you know it.
Not when it was orchestrated by a former president; it hasn't. Look it up; never in the history of the party had a former president called all the candidates to drop out simultaneously and endorse the (then) losing candidate... Never. Before. Had. It. Happened.
Right!?!
Except he isn't wrong. So, by all means - prove him wrong. We'll wait.
Lol national debt doesn’t work like your pocketbook bb.
Lmfao yeah you're totally not just a class traitor...

Class traitor is a term used mostly in socialist discourse to refer to **a member of the proletarian class who works directly or indirectly against their class interest, or against their economic benefit and in favor of the bourgeoisie.** It applies particularly to soldiers, police officers, bounty hunters, loss prevention, workers who refuse to respect picket lines during a strike and **anyone paid a wage who actively facilitates the status quo.**

The motives behind becoming a traitor to one's class can include the necessity of survival (taking up whatever wage is available), **the belief that the person is of a higher class and so has political views that work against the working class**, the pressure of conformity, or a rejection of the view that society is divided up into antagonistic classes.

Luckily there’s a slight majority of voting Americans that understand that trump lost and considering that’s factual, it’s clear that those that believe trump are the marks. Or you know, entities that need new accounts often
Avoiding the question.
You are trying too hard to troll.  Gotta at least make it believable.
I get your point, but you're not reading your own quote right lol... ""neither slavery nor involuntary servitude... Shall exist"". It's explicitly NOT permitted by the quote you just typed.
Give an example of actual chattel slavery.

Easy since it is going strong according to you.
If it’s so bad, so racist, so horrible, anyone in the US is free to leave. Adios!
And being poor is a crime these days!
That isn’t slavery lol…. You are just softening the slavery term when you direct compared it to punishment like what you have called out under the 13th amendment
Sarcasm intended.
Yep. America will never have nice things again until a revolution happens to remove legalized political bribery from politics.. which the majority of Congress and Senate thrive on.. except for the few heroes like Bernie, AOC, Nina Turner and others who refuse to take corporate and billionaire bribes. There's too many taking bribes as it is now to get anything accomplished, so every attempt at progress becomes a compromised regress.
Yes this is the reality and it will not change unless we the people change.
Why do you think the right is hellbent on trampling voting rights under the ridiculous guise of election integrity? Right now they’re planning a massive legal onslaught if the midterms anywhere they lose. That’s documented out in the open. That’s how you keep the lower and middle classes groveling. That and a few hundred million guns in the right hands…
Is that your version of “hopes and prayers”?

Underfunded and understaffed. That's the main reason Scientology gained ""religious tax exempt status"". They kept taking the IRS to court until eventually the IRS couldn't afford to keep it up.
Don’t worry! They’ve said they have added staff so they can go after more of us regular people for back taxes!
It at least actually have the balls to go after people where as the sec might send a sternly worded letter the first few times billions go missing.

Edit: I agree with you their budget needs a huge influx to become truly effective again.
It’s no coincidence that the republicans gutted IRS funding, can’t have their business daddies getting audited and fucked for their stealing from the American people
You want it to really work? Make it part of the DoD budget.
I disagree. We already have immense corruption and and starvation. They need to return to the glory of taking down Al Capone instead of the barely fuctional enough to go after middle class taxpayers.
Right and she publicly said that’s the way it should be. It’s akin to saying “let them eat cake” when the issue is blatantly obvious.
Aside from healthcare paid for by a bunch of people that don’t have any.
It was a hyperbole I do NOT believe in pizza hate and that non sense lol. I hate 100% of republicans and roughly 95% of Democrats
Yep Good facts you have laid out there. Super factual replies.
I'd say 90% are corrupt, and there are just the more obvious ones on that side.

Pretty much a 'pay attention to the giant head, don't look behind the curtain.' Sort of thing.

All of it is coordinated by incredibly wealthy individuals in order to maintain their wealth. Until the system of their wealth is broken and rebuilt in a free, transparent, and fair way; their fuckery will continue.

The dumbness of lots of americans shock me. How cant they notice that the ""left vs right"" is just a well deployed distraction by both parties. Its legit rich vs poor. Thats the only war and we arguing about social politics...
Yeah this both sides bull shit is just that...bull shit  


Either people are lying or not paying attention.
And the side that wants healthcare for everyone is effectively lobbies by drug companies to eliminate actual affordable medicine through a universal system with a single supplier. The party that actively and constantly deprecates it's own core voting base by suggesting they aren't intelligent enough as white and Asian people, to get an id card by normal means to vote. 

Yea, we seriously need a ranked voting system. Your suggestion seems to be pretty logical in terms of calculating run off.
One difference between the voters of the two parties is that Republicans don’t put candidates through stupid purity tests. They just always vote for them. Because even in their lizard brains, Republican voters understand basic civics and American politics, the importance of local government control, and above all the Federal courts.
Since when is there a degree specifically on taxation in the United States.
No I'm just tired of people like you on both sides causing this devide. Like does your whole life revolve around politics?
Isn't this the guy who traded for Mariners and had a bunch of games named after him?
His yearly take home is disgusting. Especially when his business adds no value to the market. Given the fact that his company has, allegedly, participated is mass naked shorting, he is a what many would call a parasite. 

I may be off by several thousand +/- but regardless, he makes a lot of money robbing investors, all while gaslighting the public and acting like he is some good doer. 

The more you dig on the man, the more you find and see his true character. 

The amount of control his company has over the market is insane and not being used for good. Follow the money and paper trails - but I promise you one thing, you’ll likely end up angry. 

So, if you’re an investor, the single most important thing you can do is direct register any shares you own. This takes it out of the brokers ownership and puts it into your name (unless you’re direct registered, you do not own that share, period). 

Thanks for listening to me rant. KCG is a piece of work, and he’s simply a mini boss.
Lol mate you couldn’t be farther off. You ever heard the saying don’t assume because it makes an ass out if you and me. Instead of making snap judgements maybe you should be a little more curious. Fuck Nancy pelosi and any establishment politicians who take money form super pacs. And I actually didn’t know about bernies properties until you made that comment. Then I took to the internet to research and what I gathered from multiple articles was that not a single one of his properties is worth a million dollars. The most expensive was around 700k. But I do agree with you that it is very cute how naive some people are and it seems you may be one of them.

1. Yes, for everyone.
2. I disagree.
Blockchain adds extensive regulations and oversight. That's the entire point. This is the institution being rebuilt.
That's also a big part of Stonk with people pushing for major market reform for over a year now. 

But lately, with the new tech GameStop is working on, people are caught up in the web3/blockchain stuff.
It's difficult because I want to tell you everything all at once. How can I do that more effectively?

I agree with you 100% it sounds like crazy town. It's boring, legal, financial crime, legislative crazy town. We've been talking about the economic world you see around you for 2 years. There's more to come and it's all public information. 

Check our the FederalRegister.gov once a day and read what's going on. Then look at how the media talks about it. It's disappointing but there's change coming.

Just this year the SEC has been a flurry of activity. The DOJ has a whole new division for this stuff now and regulations are happening all over the place. The market we know is incredibly manipulative.
You think this is capitalism? This is wealth equality.
Sounds pretty awesome to me!

I used to love that company. Too bad it's morally corrupt now.
All part of their preemptive deflection of blame towards retail investors, with the SEC doing jack shit to stop their crooked behavior.
Where would I find this video?  Just trying to catch up.
Apes are everywhere 🦍
Nah its way more long term than that usually except there was the guy that bought the whole outstanding shares of a small company yet the next day he finsihed buying a large % like 30-40% of it, the float of the company traded like 10x the next day and knocked the price down 90% or something
You think that matters to the people in charge? You’d have a much larger impact organising general strikes and advancing the union movement. But that requires actual work, and not just direct registering your shares and patting yourself on the back.
You are in a cult. You’re not going to like hearing that, but you are 100% in a cult that is making you give them your money.

Down 10% maybe? I've been down over 70% at various points, up over 200% at other times. Never sold a single share, just averaged down. It's incredibly volatile.
I think the only thing pathetic here is you, considering this is literally just a rehash of the environment and illegal actions which caused the 2008 recession, just on a much more massive scale. How about you do some research before calling people pathetic you nematode?
>We're in agreement there, and if you spent much time on the sub you'd know that's the consensus opinion. Apex 'turned off the buy button' for every broker they serviced. At this stage, no-one can prove why they did that, but I certainly don't think they did it for my benefit. Who did that move benefit? The hedge funds with short positions they couldn't unwind. You mention Robinhood, and their bad bet; OK if that's the case, why was the buy button turned off for all the other brokers too, including the ones that weren't PFOF-based? The list of brokers which didn't turn off buy, is VERY short.

Apex and other clearing houses did it specifically to protect themselves. They raise collateral requirements from brokers for any volatile security since they're the ones taking on the risk of default. That risk is especially high when tons of people suddenly make new trading accounts, deposit money, and buy a stock instantly like many people did during the surge. That's trading on margin whether people realize it or not, since money takes time to transfer into the brokerage account. All brokerages are going to raise margin requirements in a situation like that even if they're flush with cash and some are going to flat out restrict purchases.

>That is not correct, as confirmed by CS. Your order is sold at the price when you placed the sell order, not the price several days later. It sounds like you've commingled settlement and how they BUY shares (which, iirc is done daily in a 500-share block). Probably possible if you DRS your shares, for there to be a few risky days where they haven't settled yet and can't be sold. That's definitely a dampening factor on why it took me a while to DRS.

I could be wrong about that. It's how a lot of transfer agents do it. I looked up their selling methods and it seems like they have Block Sell (which functions how I said), Market Sell (which also sells at whatever price it is when it executes, but theoretically should be done faster), and Limit Sell (where it'll only execute if the price goes above your limit). I can't find anything about the actual speed with which market and limit sells execute once you request them. If you have more info I'd be glad to read it.

>The amount of DRS'd shares is surging. It's up to about 40k per day now. GME now state the number of DRSd shares in their quarterly results. Cost to borrow is also surging.

It would be cool if they did manage to DRS enough of the float to make a squeeze happen but I'm not holding my breath. Movements tend to lose steam over time and I just can't see the current rate continuing to 50% or higher. I'd love to be proven wrong.

>Are you aware of dark pools? If there's nothing dodgy going on, why are millions of shares traded every day in a secret dark pool with no regulation? 

Yes, and they are regulated by the SEC. The whole point of them is to facilitate large block orders, like a million shares at a time, between institutional investors without affecting the share price on lit exchanges. It's beneficial to institutional investors because they can get better price points compared to selling a million shares on a lit market which will drive down the price and significantly and in turn, their average sell price. It doesn't affect retail investing very much unless you're invested in things like mutual funds or have a pension. In that case it's slightly beneficial to you since the mutual fund can get better deals. 

That's all in theory. In practice, they're basically places for High Frequency Traders and shady exchange operators to get rich through front running at the expense of their own customers. Again, it doesn't really impact lit exchanges or retail investors very much, aside from making price discovery a bit worse. That said, the reason for their inception is no longer relevant since the average block size keeps shrinking on dark pools. Even super large blocks are broken up into smaller chunks and bought/sold through high frequency trading. If they were banned lit exchanges would get a lot more volatile so that's probably not the right answer. They do need tighter regulations and restrictions though.

>Why are Transfer Agents or companies not allowed to promote direct registration? DTCC is a company, not a gov agency, why do they needed protecting from competition in a 'free & fair' market? 

I've never heard about a ban on direct registration promotion. Do you have a link where I can read about it?

I'm not sure if the DTCC gets actual protection from competition. It's more that they're so enmeshed with the Fed, US monetary policy, and exchanges, that the barrier to entry for a competitor is impossibly high. I can't tell you why it's an approved monopoly because I don't know myself. They are highly regulated though. 

>Further, the ACTUAL goal of DRS is to prove naked shorting.

>Currently there's no solid proof, because the markets are setup to be so incredibly dense and complex, and the regulators have been captured for a while (look at the crossover between hedge funds and agencies / companies like DTCC, SEC etc) making data hard to gather. Once enough shares are taken out of the float, it will make a nonsense of the idea that hedge funds aren't naked shorting if there's still 50m+ going to the dark pool every day. Dark pool, sounds eerie and conspiratorial, but that's genuinely what they're called and how they function. Should be common knowledge.

Everyone knows naked shorting still happens but I'm not sure how this would prove anything. Where are you getting the 50m number from? Are you talking about a dollar amount? Because the short volume in dark pools isn't anywhere close to that high:

https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nyse-gme/short-volume/

https://www.stockgrid.io/darkpools/GME

Let's say retail investors somehow manage to lock in the entire available float on lit exchanges. Institutions will still hold a significant percentage of the float and they'll still be free to trade those shares back and forth in dark pools as much as they want. Short volume in lit or dark pools could be 100 million on Monday and it still wouldn't prove naked shorting because it's technically possible for that to be a single share that was traded 100 million times. Volume can be much higher than the float for both long and short shares.

>It honestly feels like, as I suggested, you're missing the point of the sub underneath all the lunacy it inevitably attracts. It's not JUST a stock play. It's a way to hit back at a corrupt system. It's so much more than 'failing brick-and-mortar stores' and 'crazy retail redditors'. It's about shining a light on how corrupt markets are, and (we hope) creating an alternative. You won't have naked shorting and rehypothecated shares on a token-driven, blockchain-based stock market, which is what they're building towards while everyone is running round laughing at NFTs.

I can appreciate the goal but I can't help feel that the amount of misinformation there does more harm than good. 

>You sound quite knowledgeable on reverse repo, and I'll admit there are gaps in my knoweldge. Can you explain to me in layman's terms why there are trillions in overnight loans every 24hrs, and why the beneficiaries are kept secret? Would markets collapse if they stopped this overnight lending or made it public which banks need so much liquidity injecting? Liquidity for what? Oh, and thanks for remaining civil with me.

The Fed's main goal is to keep the economy stable and on track with low unemployment. To do this they attempt to keep inflation / deflation in check using a few different methods. One of the things they do is set a federal funds rate which is the interest rate banks and financial institutions charge each other to borrow money overnight. This rate has far ranging implications for loans, credit card rates, market exchanges, and all sorts of other things that directly impact inflationary and deflationary pressures. 

Banks and financial institutions are required by law to keep a certain amount of money in reserve to meet withdraw and deposit demands. This amount is also set by the Fed. The rest they don't have to keep on hand and instead can use to try to make money themselves (there are lots of restrictions to this, but that's the general idea). At the end of each day all the banks check their balance sheets to see where they are in relation to the reserve amount they have to keep. If they're over the amount they can lend that extra money out to other banks which are under. The next day they're paid back with interest. The interest rate is supposed to be the federal funds rate set by the Fed. 

In reality the federal funds rate is a target rate, not a requirement. The actual lending rate is set by negotiation between the banks themselves. To keep the actual lending rate close to the federal funds rate the Fed changes liquidity by pumping money into and out of the economy using Open Market Operations. They use both permanent open market operations and temporary ones. Permanent is where the Fed is constantly buying or selling US treasuries. If they want to pull money out of the economy they sell treasuries. If they want to pump money in they purchase treasuries. Repos and reverse repos are a form of temporary OMO used to temporarily increase or decrease the supply of reserves in the banking system. 

part 1....
part 2...

When COVID-19 hit the economy tanked and the Fed started purchasing a shitload of US treasuries every month to pump money into the economy (called Quantitative Easing) and they lowered the federal funds rate from around 1.5% to 0.00-0.25%. When the economy started picking back up about a year ago they initially said they had no plans to dial back their purchasing or adjust rates for a while still. They did actually raise reverse repo rates around this time to get the effective federal funds rate back to around 0.15 from ~0.03. Then it became clear that inflation was going to be a much bigger issue than anticipated so they accelerated the tapering plan and announced multiple planned rate hikes (already up to 0.82% or something like that). Starting this coming week they'll be throwing it in reverse by starting quantitative tightening to tamp down on inflation. This will put upward pressure on treasury yields and will likely cause reverse repo numbers to decline. 

Part of the reason why the reverse repo numbers have been so high is because financial institutions are now flush with cash and they don't have many attractive options to spend it on. Short term treasury yields have been near rock bottom throughout the pandemic and that's one of the things they'd usually spend extra money on. A reverse repo is a place for them to park cash overnight and gain slightly better gains than most alternatives for the moment. It's not the banks that need liquidity, they have too much. The Fed is intentionally decreasing their liquidity.

https://ycharts.com/indicators/1_month_treasury_rate#:~:text=1%20Month%20Treasury%20Rate%20is%20at%200.87%25%2C%20compared%20to%200.85,long%20term%20average%20of%201.17%25. (look at the 3y chart)

Also, a quick note about reverse repos: ""The Federal Reserve manages overnight interest rates by setting the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate, which is the rate paid to depository institutions on balances maintained at Federal Reserve Banks. The ON RRP provides a floor under overnight interest rates by offering a broad range of financial institutions that are ineligible to earn IORB, an alternative risk-free investment option. Together, the IORB rate and the ON RRP set a floor under overnight rates, beneath which banks and non-bank financial institutions should be unwilling to invest funds in private markets.

I don't actually know why the institutions that participate aren't listed somewhere but it's not a complete mystery since the Fed talks about it on occasion. Back in July 2021 when RRP started to rise they said, “The increase in [RRP] participation was driven in part by larger investments from money market funds, as ongoing reductions in net Treasury bill issuance contributed to downward pressure on yields of other investment options available to these funds.”

If they closed reverse repos overnight the market wouldn't crash. All that would happen is financial institutions would go back to purchasing other, less attractive securities with their extra cash.

I'm sorry if I came across as hostile in my previous post. I just really don't like how moderation handles the misinformation there. I also don't like how much in common it has with every pump and dump scheme community from shitcoins to penny stocks to NFTs of bored apes. They all spam the crap out of BUY AND HODL, NEVER SELL, WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON! in order to pump the asset up with as much upward pressure as possible before bailing themselves or rug pulling. The blind fanaticism over Gamestop itself also drives me nuts. Gamestop just released a terrible quarterly report with an EPS of -2 and a loss of $160 million and the thread I read on Superstonk made it seem like the best report in history and all the comments mentioning the negative aspects were buried. Ignoring bad news doesn't make it go away. It just turns the community into an echo chamber.

Thanks for taking the time to respond with a thoughtful reply. I hope you have a great weekend!

Do you have a source on any of those statements?
Lol least delusional leftist
Do you not understand the difference between a primary and a general election.
Congrats, you got played by the Russian operative
Those factors do muddy the waters, but I don't think any of that outweighs the hard data of the election results. When comparing polls of ""who would you support in a hypothetical matchup"" versus the actual results of actual elections, democratic voters overwhelmingly picked Biden over Bernie in swing states.

Is it possible that Bernie could have beaten Trump? Sure, Trump was a weak candidate and weird results are possible. But the hard data of how voters actually behaved on election day seems to strongly indicate Bernie's support did not turn out like we hoped.
So you like living in a democracy where a candidate received 3 million more votes than their opponent and lost, but that’s more of an indictment on the candidate than our fucked up system?

Wow, this really is the dumbest “economics” sub on Reddit!
Literally none of what you said proves anything you moron, shut the fuck up.

Bernie couldn't beat Hillary why would he beat Trump?
Not at all. 

What I have is that HRC is career liar who was the worst democratic candidate in her party’s history.  

But yeah… the DNC got what it deserved.
Before 2016, during the primary process, they only showed pledged delegate totals. 

In 2016, despite the democratic nomination never having to go to the superdelegates (i.e. DNC officials and other high ranking Democrats) for a vote (which is supposed to happen when there isn't a clear leader from the primary pledged delegates), they decided to start publishing the pledged superdelegate counts. Superdelegates, which technically shouldn't matter UNLESS there's a close race, and  shouldn't publicly pledge to any candidate during the primary process. It threw off the totals enough that it discouraged a lot of Bernie voters from voting since it was a ""losing"" battle. Plenty of superdelegates pledged early because it was ""Hillary's turn"". 

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/25/democrats-rules-superdelegates-sanders

In 2020, despite winning just 1 state in February out of 4, the day before super Tuesday, 5 major candidates dropped out and pledged their support for Biden (including Buttigeig who had won or split 2 of the other 4 February states). I haven't seen any proof that this one was the DNC telling them to drop out to ensure they'd have their candidate, but at the same time the timing was extremely suspicious, especially with a candidate dropping out after having won a decent number of delegates. Add in the fact that this is the first time in decades that the winner of the Iowa caucus didn't win the primary, and it all just kinda seems wrong.

The reality is that a lot of Sanders' votes where just anti-Clinton votes.
Where'd you get downvoted? Biden was heavily supported on most political subreddits.
neoliberal democrats and republicans are the exact same thing. also nice cherry picking, forget all the other stuff.

What a silly take. Your candidate lost to mine. Any criticism of my candidate for losing to trump, by definition, weighs heavier on yours.


There’s nothing sadder than aging Bernie bros. You’ve gotta move on. No one takes you seriously.
A majority of Americans agree with a minimum wage of $15 / hour.

A majority of Americans agree with a single-payer system (depending on how you write it; many polls were written by HMO's to attempt to disprove this).  


A majority of Americans agree that the higher education system is broken and students shouldn't be saddled with the massive debts they have now (and at least a portion of which should be forgiven).  


A majority of Americans agree with getting corporate and special interest money out of politics.

&#x200B;

A majority of Americans agree with higher taxes for corporations and the wealthy.

&#x200B;

So sure, I suppose Bernie agreeing with the majority of Americans on a few basic economic policies just wasn't enough to make him ""mainstream.""  


Which economic solutions of his, might I ask, did NOT a majority of Americans agree with?
Your post history is a laughable array of right wing Republican talking points, but okay. Sure. ""both sides"".

You realize it's simpler seeing someone smoke weed than it is to unravel a financial crime. There are people unraveling financial crimes every day. Just because you don't pay attention to it doesn't mean it's not happening. Check the SEC enforcement website or any states enforcement site. And just because you think something would be a crime doesn't mean it actually is.
I think that overall there are core beliefs that take very, very much to change and there are subsidiary beliefs that can change. I've slowly allowed my core beliefs to be everchanging which could be good or bad. I'm very fluid which I'm sure some see as wishy washy or non-committal. I also change beliefs based on who I'm talking to and my mindset at the time. Maybe others would consider me too influenced by others.
I also highly agree with your point on happiness. Happiness I think is basically 95% subjective. You can create happiness out of nothing and with nothing. If you think you're happy, you are happy. And more power to you! If your chosen path of happiness does not intrude me, you can do as you please. Maybe I'm libertarian haha.

There is no progressive policies just regressive vs common sense.

There have been reports to Congress on what levels of funding the IRS requires to operate properly, and what returns Congress can expect for the money spent.

For every dollar Congress funds the IRS, the IRS returns 6. The IRS is underfunded by billions. You do the math.
The point is, this isn’t something new. It’s all gotten out of hand. Congress is now a career and it was never intended to be. These rules aren’t Pelosi’s. The Dems can’t even get basic gun regulation, or universal healthcare, or voting rights, or much of anything past rightwing blockades. Christ, in the relative scheme of things, congress buying stock is pretty far down on my list of issues that affect my life.

If you need me to explain to you what’s going on in this country, you’ve got bigger problems than being a whiner on Reddit…
Exactly. Can’t stand when people conveniently omit Pelosi et al names when sounding off about the insider trading by congresspeople
I agree, but there needs to be a priority. Ideally, the Republican party is turned on its head and most of its members are ousted, with a new group brought in by informed and empowered voters.

Then we look at the do-nothing Democrats who have been paralyzed and festering in their chairs. 

Honestly I think adding ranked choice voting addresses both of those issues. It gives third parties a real chance of winning an office, and we might see serious contenders in those groups, then, that can challenge a standing office holder.
Bring back the Twitter account that follows all of Nancy 'The Handbag' Pelosi's stock trades.

Well for one thing fuck elon. What wrong with Bill gates thou he donated billions to charity, helped 3rd world country with health services. He's bad because u believe he put nano chips I to vaccine?.
I agree, but that hasn't ended well in the past. Maybe playing the long game would work. In the long term, they will try to take our liberties and sustenance for more power and self help. Seems like a much more realistic and civilized method to root them out.
While I admit we tend to focus on the wrong things when vetting candidates, I don't see how a ""woke"" purity test is any different from a Protestant Evangelical ""Christian"" purity test that a huge majority of red literally must be.

You might also be right that the generally older and richer GOP voting base pays more attention to political discourse, but I would counter they understand the actual implications.  TCJA is a perfect example.  GOP voters still love it, not understanding that it bald-faced moved money out of the middle and lower class and into the wealthy.  

In fact I'd argue a huge number are voting staunchly against, say, abortion, while their candidates implement policies that are detrimental to that voter.
There are essentially three types.  MBT (Master of Business Taxation), or Mac T (Master of Accountancy Taxation), and finally Doctoral programs in Taxation and Tax theory.  

Both Master's degrees are similar and will contain primarily tax courses, while have preliminary requirements that are either business environment or accounting focused.
Kinda hard to avoid politics in a sub like r/economy…
Nope I'm trolling most of the time.
Everyone's life revolves around politics, you just live a sheltered and privileged enough life that you can simply not worry about any of it because no one is trying to take rights away from straight white males.

If that doesn't describe you, you've been lied to and are buying those lies without any critical thought. 

Politics literally touches every aspect of our lives, and it's stupid to act like you can just avoid it.

All of the tech giants have 10x-100x more software engineers, pay them 2x what GameStop pays their SWEs (which means they get all the top tier talent), have better and more established brand names, and have billions in cash to throw at potentially profitable ventures. I don’t see how GameStop could possibly beat them.
Except it doesn’t. You either have proof of work and its fucked environmentally, or proof of stake, and then you just have the same consolidation of wealth issues that allow market manipulation. Blockchain tech isn’t suitable as a financial solution.

I’ll just DRS instead.
Would love to hear someone refute all of the evidence that the major short parties never closed their position. And I mean actually have a real conversation, not just dismiss the entire movement because ""you're just crazy,"" or ""it's a cult."" I want to know what you know that makes you so sure.

The one metric that MSM shoves down your throat is short interest %.  This number went down, so shorts must have closed, right? But it's self-reported and there are a million ways to hide from having to report real short positions.

Besides just short positions, it's become pretty clear that some very major parties are short volatility (and were pre-sneeze, too). If that means nothing to you, I highly recommend you do some research on your own around variance swaps and other volatility products and how they have been used aggressively over the last decade or two. What's been happening is that large hedge funds have been shorting volatility; it's a way to increase your returns most years, but without proper hedging, when you lose, you'll lose BIG. There is a reason that 100s of tickers were all exploding at once in January 2021, and ""crazy redditors"" ain't it. Go look at the Jan 21 timeframe for BBBY, EXPR, FOSL, TR, KOSS, MAC, FIZZ, IRBT, PETS, BB, RKT, SENS, BGS, LUMN, GBR, KODK, SHLDQ, BLIAQ...I could keep going. The reason is likely that many of these stocks and dozens of others were lumped together in large variance swap positions.

Check out this presentation on the risk management failures that occured/are occurring with GME if you want more detail.
 https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.northinfo.com/documents/993.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj9z5-B35P4AhWASTABHc4sDmcQFnoECAYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0I-um2lbsOT19IJtt8RAu9

Besides short volatility, redditors in superstonk noticed insane amounts of put options being bought by firms in Brazil and then wiped from Bloomberg terminals. They realized that Bill Hwang (Archegos - recently arrested) was short GME after it was mentioned in a credit suisse report. He was just one glaring example that proves how easy it is to take out insanely levered positions using swaps without having to report it. But in some instances there are trails of evidence, mostly in options chains but it's also become increasingly obvious that ETF's are being used to aggressively short certain tickers. The rules around ETF redemption are complete loopholes and one of largest containing gamestop, XRT, has been reporting failure to delivers in the millions and up until just recently was on the SEC's ""threshold"" list for months.

This doesn't even mention the skyrocketing cost to borrow gme that occured recently and has happened to some extent before major runs. Which I'm sure you have an explanation for besides just ""frenzied redditors"" which is a total cop-out.

There are total idiots on superstonk, absolutely. But there are some really smart folks there too. Don't just dismiss them as a cult unless you've come prepared with research. Like I said, I'd love to have a real conversation if you want to lay out some of the evidence you have on the matter since it sounds like you are quite confident that we are wrong.
IBKR just turned off shorting GME. There are no more shares available. Shorts r fucked.
My god you keep posting this article but you haven’t even read it lmfao.

The article isn’t saying you should dump 100% of your funds into one bucket. It’s saying diversification recklessly doesn’t protect you from bad investments.

My 5 year old nephew would be able to tell you that it’s not smart to risk your entire life on one chance.

I sincerely hope for your own sake you wake up and scale back before you lose your entire life to the whims of a meme stock
Did you actually read the articleyou linked?

""Clearly, a line exists between sensibly spreading your funds among enough investments to avoid a financial disaster and diversifying with such fervor that you end up owning too many investments with little or no benefit.""

So diversify but don't go crazy.  He is still saying you should diversify.  He is definitely not saying you should YOLO one stock.
>Thanks for taking the time to respond with a thoughtful reply. I hope you have a great weekend!

No problem. This conversation has been really interesting; feel like I've learned some stuff and gained a different perspective. I wish there was more crossover between communities, a point someone made about the sub being 'hive-mind-y' is a very fair criticism (though imo it's less a criticism of any particular sub, more of an eventuality with any movement due to the inherently tribal nature of our species). I've fallen foul of that in the past, sometimes people shoot the messenger if you say something unpopular, and once the first downvote is in, it tends to snowball.

I'll respond properly later as there were a few parts I didn't understand or have a different perspective on, but got some stuff to do. Hope your weekend goes well too!

Why don't you people ever ask yourself why the hell would anyone choose a known racist who loves militarizing cops and who has never been out of DC since NINETEEN SEVENTY FUCKING FOUR??  He was by far the most unqualified candidate on that primary stage behind Michael Bloomberg, and that's saying a lot because EVERY candidate was shit. It's amazing how fast everyone dropped out just because Clyburn endorsed Biden after Bernie absolutely mopping the floor with him. Even trump knew it and admitted it. You people just cant admit that you are all failures and that you are the reason we have a nation full of fucking nazis now, and on top of that you want us to disarm and lie down for them.

So Bernie should have gamed the electoral college to win instead of getting more votes?
And you win the neoliberal award for buying their BS!
It didn't help with the mainstream media carrying water for the Biden campaign throughout, especially after Nevada and South Carolina; ""if you want to beat Trump, Biden is the candidate to do it."" Democratic leaning voters have a much higher faith in MSM than progressives and right-leaning voters (most MSM has a neoliberal viewpoint). But even during the primary, in every single state, post-voting polling showed that the candidate that most Democratic primary voters agreed with was Bernie; he was their best choice even if they didn't vote for him. Meaning the compelling message, even if it wasn't true, that Biden beats Trump really helped Biden beat the candidate who best would've represented Democratic values. You know the old saying, vote with your heart in the primary and your head in the general? This brain-washing helped convince enough people that only Biden could win, and they believed it (but ironically, IMHO, it helped beat the better candidate in the primary).

Idk, Bernie literally lost votes from 2016 to 2020 in virtually every battleground state despite effectively running for President for 5 years.

How do you LOSE popularity? No wonder you’re so bitter!
2016:

Hillary won without superdelegates. I was able to vote for Bernie in the primary. What does superdelegate total have to do with anything? Is posting statistics making people vote against their will? Do you honestly believe people are just going to vote for someone else because superdelegates? There was 2 fucking options, it's not like superdelegates were splitting the votes of multiple candidates. You either wanted one or the other. Would you honestly consider voting against who you actually want to win because of superdelegates? Are you being honest with yourself?

2020:

So this is of course the argument that if the candidate field had all just stayed in the race longer the overall larger moderate coalition wouldn't have just won anyway? I don't get it. The people who drop out don't just keep their delegates forever, they get redistributed based on state vote totals once they drop out. You're basically arguing it was rigged because Bernie wasn't able to win by splitting up all of the moderates. Sounds silly.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/03/what-happens-candidates-delegates-when-they-drop-out/

> One distinction Putnam draws is that while we generally talk about who won how many delegates in the contests so far, for the most part no one actually has any delegates at this point. Those delegates will be assigned at party conventions later in the year. Instead, candidates have mostly won “delegate slots” — placeholders for delegates to be assigned later. (The “mostly” qualifiers there are a carve-out for some district delegates in New Hampshire who’ve already been selected.)

> This is important because those slots will be filled with delegates for only those candidates who are still in the race. In New Hampshire, for example, if Buttigieg is no longer a candidate by the time of the state convention, the three delegates he won by virtue of his statewide vote total would be redistributed among the other candidates still in the race who’d crossed the 15 percent statewide threshold. Since the other two candidates earning statewide delegates in New Hampshire were Klobuchar and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the effect would be that Sanders gets all of those delegates.

> Putnam’s interpretation of the rules is that by suspending their campaigns, as opposed to dropping out, Buttigieg and Klobuchar can protect their delegates from being reallocated. The Democratic National Committee, however, disagrees: They’re out of the race. In June, Iowa’s delegates will be resorted to those candidates who are still in — Sanders, if he is.

And with the Iowa thing, history doesn't mean anything. Who fucking cares that Iowa is a usual predictor? That doesn't make something legally binding lol.
NYT reported that Obama called the candidates to drop out and get behind Biden. I'm sure no favors were promised in the process, Lol.

> Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in a new interview appeared to walk back her claim that last year’s Democratic primary was rigged, suggesting instead that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) showed “some bias” but that the selection process had been “fair.”

> “I agree with what Donna Brazile has said over the last few days; that while there was some bias at the DNC, the overall 2016 primary process was fair and Hillary made history,” Warren said in a Wednesday interview with MassLive. 

> Her remarks contrasted with what she told CNN’s Jake Tapper last week. Pressed by Tapper about whether she believed the primary had been rigged in then-candidate Hillary Clinton’s favor, Warren responded: “Yes.”

> A spokeswoman for Warren’s office did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment.

> Former interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile ignited a firestorm last week after Politico published an excerpt from her upcoming book, in which she claimed she had found evidence the Clinton campaign had fixed the Democratic nomination system in the candidate’s favor.

> Brazile said she discovered an agreement between the DNC and the Clinton campaign that suggested the nomination was fixed long before the former secretary of State would become the party’s official nominee, tilting the scales away from Clinton’s rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

> “If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead. This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party’s integrity,” Brazile wrote in the excerpt.

> Following the publication of the excerpt, Brazile dismissed suggestions that the nominating process was “rigged.”

> “I found no evidence, none, whatsoever,” Brazile told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, adding that she did not believe Warren “meant the the word ‘rigged.'”

> “The only thing I found — which I said, I found the cancer, but I’m not killing the patient — was this memorandum that prevented the DNC from running its own operation,” she continued.

> Clinton on Wednesday weighed in on the claims, saying the controversial remarks about the party’s presidential primary being rigged “just wasn’t the case.”

> “I didn’t know what she was referring to because, as has now come out, that just wasn’t the case,” Clinton said during an appearance on NBC’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers.”

[I believe this was all in reference to the DNC being in debt and being bailed out by Clinton?](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2017/11/10/elizabeth-warren-rigged/)

> A week after saying she believed the Democratic primary was “rigged” for Hillary Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren is walking that position back.

> It was, in fact, “fair,” she said in an interview with the Springfield Republican this week.

> Warren stirred controversy when, during an appearance on CNN, she was asked if she believed the allegations in Donna Brazile’s upcoming book about a deal between Clinton and the Democratic National Convention meant the primary was “rigged.” Her response was clear: “Yes.”

> Brazile’s accusations have been fleshed out a little more fully over the past week. For starters, Clinton’s campaign helped the DNC financially in exchange for more control long before the primary contest was decided, yes, but at least on paper the agreement only applied to the general election. Brazile has also tried to distance herself from the “rigged” narrative.

> Warren, who has stuck by her criticism that the DNC needs reform to inspire confidence in how it picks its nominees, has since sought to expand on her monosyllabic response. “I agree with what Donna Brazile has said over the last few days; that while there was some bias at the DNC, the overall 2016 primary process was fair and Hillary made history,” Warren told the Republican.

> Warren did not endorse either Clinton or her opponent Bernie Sanders during the primary in Massachusetts, which Clinton won by the slim margin of 50.1 to 48.7.

[The  ""controlling of the DNC"" was limited to the general election. Nothing to do with the primary.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/memo-reveals-details-hillary-clinton-dnc-deal-n817411)

> WASHINGTON — The Democratic National Committee struck a deal with Hillary Clinton in 2015 that gave her campaign input on some party hiring and spending decisions, but required they be related only to preparations for the general election, according to a memo obtained by NBC News. It also left the door open for other candidates to make similar arrangements.

> The document provides more context to the explosive claims made by former DNC Interim Chair Donna Brazile in a forthcoming book, an excerpt of which was published this week.

> The August 26, 2015, memorandum of understanding from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook to DNC CEO Amy Dacey details the relationship between Clinton's campaign and the DNC long before she won her party's nomination.

> In exchange for Hillary for America's (HFA) helping the cash-strapped DNC raise money, the party committee agreed ""that HFA personnel will be consulted and have joint authority over strategic decisions over the staffing, budget, expenditures, and general election related communications, data, technology, analytics, and research.""

> Specifically, the DNC agreed to hire a communications director from ""one of two candidates previously identified as acceptable to HFA."" More broadly, the DNC maintained ""the authority to make the final decision"" on senior staff in the communications, technology and research departments, but agreed that the party organization would choose only ""between candidates acceptable to HFA.""

> The memo stipulates the DNC had to hire a communications director by September 11, 2015, months before the first nominating contests in early 2016.

> However, the memo also made clear that the arrangement pertained to only the general election, not the primary season, and it left open the possibility that it would sign similar agreements with other candidates.

Let me ask you a question. How was I able to vote for Bernie in the primary if it was rigged?
Lol
Remembers how Bernie won the primary squarely in Iowa but they decided it a tie after one of buttigieg's supporters at the polling site did a coin flip and you can watch him in real time flip the coin, catch it, look at it and then flip it over in his hand so the delegates went to Pete.

Anyone saying there weren't any bullshit shenanigans going on in either the 2016 or 2020 primary really wasn't paying attention or has an active interest in denying it.

The DNC is corrupt as shit and has no interest in actually following the will of the voters--they already have their predetermined picks and work meticulously behind the scenes to ensure their candidate ascends.
Lol, probably this fucking subreddit. The front page on Super Tuesday was about how Bernie won his home state and Beto’s former band mate spoke highly of Bernie. The absolute thrashing that Bernie took was nowhere to be found.
Not during the primaries. People absolutely hated Biden. It wasn’t until he won the primary and it became Trump vs Biden that Biden was heavily supported.
No they are very different. For example republicans are against abortion but neolibs are generally in favor.
It was the first article you shared and felt like it basically invalidated your whole premise.

When you have absolutely no handle on American politics but want to sound edgy online, this is the exact sentiment I would expect.

I had explained in my last comment but this is my final statement. Voting americans don't want a more left leaning democrat than usual, they want moderates. It's why moderates are voted, like all the time

But this is Reddit, think what you will, this place is terrible for political discussion we shouldn't waste each other's time if we're probably not going to agree
So what’s your point?
At this moment in time the democrats have the floor. I have no doubt George Bush was as corrupt as Biden and Pelosi. I didn’t reverse course I am pointing out that corruption is rampant but right now the hapless democrats have their turn in the barrel. Trump may be crazy but he properly identified the swamp.
The question is then, why do we allow politicians to spend our resources on fighting petty crime rather than big crime? Lack of awareness or lack of democracy? 

I never vote for politicians, I always vote for direct democracy.
regressive policy, like abortion banning for example?
What civil liberties are the left campaigning to take away?
I mean I think progressives largely just want to bring the us in line with other rich countries to make it a little less shitty, eg fixing healthcare, education, labor rights
You don't need nestle chocolate to prevent countless people from dying. Please dear God, think about what you say before you say it. A doctor that tells their patient they need to inject insulin so they don't die isn't advocating for business practices. 

The sad thing is, I know you know all this. Unfortunately you decide to base your political identity on being as brain dead as possible. It's sad, get some help
I get it, probably best. That being said, I don't believe people like this deserve to share bullshit and not face as much scrutiny as possible for it
Dude, it was in the NY Times; the NYT! There isn't a more neoliberal outfit than that and they were among the many to break the story. Obama called the candidates before they dropped out to coax them into shifting their voters over to Biden. He wasn't able to convince Warren to drop out, but was able to sideline her to avoid her voters from moving over to Bernie. Maybe he called Mayo Pete after he dropped out as well, but he \*definitely\* called him before he dropped out. Why else do you think he's now Secretary of Transportation, LoL? He ""earned"" it.
Lmfao really? That's your response? ""Grow up bud""?

I know you don't support socialism.

That's why I cited Einstein's essay.

Most of the greatest minds in history were socialist.

Noam Chomsky, Richard Wolff, Einstein, Mark Twain, Helen Keller, MLK Jr, George Orwell, Nelson Mandela, Nikola Tesla, Woody Guthrie (This Land is Your Land), Malcolm X, Francis Bellamy (The pledge of allegiance), Oppenheimer, Oscar Wylde (The Painting of Dorian Gray), Pablo Picasso, the list goes on and on and on.

Grow up and realize that generations of the smartest people in history were socialist bud.
No one of significance said that. What a hilariously weak attempt to conflate the two reactions to make trump seem remotely coherent. 

Trump did say that election was fraudulent as well. This is the person you’re defending. A person who thought you can put sunlight in your body along with bleach.

Ohhh and here it comes. Dems are pure dems are pure…. You are showing exactly what is wrong with the left, you can’t hold your own accountable.
No one is disagreeing with you about the problem being endemic by pointing out that Pelosi personally defended it. You’re distracting from the very important issue here of wealth inequality by dismissing this as a non-issue through whataboutism and defeatism. The reason we can’t solve any of the problems you mentioned is because wealth inequality has allowed the few to possess more power than the masses. We will never solve anything as long as money and politics share a symbiotic relationship and Pelosi’s public stance on this undermines our democracy. Reigning in egregious abuses of power from any side matters even if you agree with most of the things that person/party says/does.
The rules may not be Pelosi’s but the democrats constantly capitulating to the middle of the aisle candidates hasn’t done them any good. If they wanted to get legislation passed they would do as their opposition and take that shit. Quit giving money to Joe Manchin. Why have we let him become the most powerful democrat when he seems to be going through a political identity crisis at all times. Eat Shit, we think you should leave.
If by blame everyone you mean keep up the facade of both parties being grid-locked (it wouldn't be smart for them to try and isolate the poor majoriy cause we would be more likely to unite against them) . They want to keep US against each other so we don't see that both sides of the aisle are Capitalists and it is the Capitalists that are the issue.

Did I say that? No. He did buy up a ton of farmland, stole what made him rich, has more money than anyone would ever need yet doesn't make good use of it.
The only people who have been playing the long game are the Republicans. Many of you allowed Republicans to continue to gain power as they continue to show little respect for you or the law. We just had a president who couldn't be investigated, no one around him could be questioned or subpoenad. He just said the election was stolen without showing proof or doing what is necessary to proof it. This is not a party you reward for that behavior THERE IS NO BOTH SIDES RIGHT NOW like I'm tired of hearing that just cause we have a bunch of Dems in control doesn't mean we STOP holding them accountable as well. The Dems aren't going to turn heel and be Republicans they are to wimpy to do that. We have no accountability cause the left of the right loses WIN the time is to win and if you think it's okay to let Republicans win who just had a cpac in Hungary THEN YOU DESERVE TO LOSE THIS COUNTRY.
I didn’t say anything about ‘woke’. There are actually leftists out there, for instance, who believe Democrats should primary Joe Manchin with someone from the left. There is a stunning lack of awareness in the leftward parts of the Democratic coalition about basic Civics and how American politics work.

We knew in 2016 that the Republicans were openly ready to wreck every norm to stack the federal courts, but the left continued to run anti Democratic Party discouragement efforts long after the DNC was over.

The tragedy of it is that all of the future fights were basically lost in November 2016.  What was broken when Republicans were allowed to steal that Scalia seat and all of those open federal judiciary seats cannot be put back together.
TIL, thank you for clarifying
Dude just stop. I understand politics affects peoples lives. But in case you haven't noticed this right vs left, my team vs yours is tearing us apart. It's not making our world and our society better. Quite the opposite. And if you seriously think it's not driving the devide then you are blind. And if you actually think that the growing divide from the toxicity of tribal politics is helping us in any way you are delusional.

But I wouldn't expect someone so tied to tribalism as you to understand that. So keep rooting for your team. Keep blaming the otherside while they blame you.

A little further down this thread a good link on the talent-building was shared, don't know if you missed it;

Show me anywhere that says that lol not true at all. If you are talking about settlement time of T+2 thats something completely different
They can also get around T+2 by the way by sending trades to their offices overseas. One of the reasons they all have businesses set up in other countries too. They get an extra 3 days on top of T+2 just to settle. These are completely different from naked shorts but also a way they can manipulate price action.
That’s not true. You have a source for your assertion?
So if I invested my life savings in apple or Microsoft or Facebook before they evolved also, wouldn't also be smart?
Yes, Depends on your goals.

 Here's a goal of mine - [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/buy-stocks/) Advantages of Buying Individual Stocks
Earn Money from Growth and Dividends
There are two ways to earn money from owning stocks: growth and dividends.

With growth, you aim to buy stocks cheap and sell them after their prices rise. Buy-and-hold and value investors aim to own individual stocks for long periods of time, measured in months or years. Day traders, meanwhile, only own stocks for hours—or even just minutes. These strategies couldn’t be more different, but the goal is the same: Buy stocks when prices are low and sell them when they’re high.

In addition, stocks that pay dividends earn you money without you needing to sell any shares. When public companies are profitable, some choose to return a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of regular dividends.
I had the same thought! I really hope it's success will help get more books translated to English.

This is all true, and it's possible things would have gone differently if the Democratic had establishment would have gone hard on supporting Bernie. But that's ultimately speculation - we simply don't know if enough people could have been persuaded in that scenario. It's possible, but results from state elections seems to indicate that moderate candidates beat far left candidates in most swing states, so Bernie would have to buck a big national trend to pull that off. 

Basically, the argument that Bernie would have beaten Trump relies on lots of assumptions and hypotheticals. It's possible, but definitely not something we can say with any confidence.
So you have no response to how Bernie would have won then?

You can say you're right all you want, but Bernie couldn't even win the primary.

People didn't vote for him. The end.
When we have one party fucking around and the other is a shitshow, you’re damn right people are bitter. 

But hey, if you’re happy with our current economy and state of affairs, ignorance is bliss.
> Let me ask you a question. How was I able to vote for Bernie in the primary if it was rigged?

It was rigged in the sense that all of the support of the DNC went to Hillary including things like slipping her campaign upcoming debate questions ahead of time. It wasn't 'rigged' in the sense the vote was rigged.

Of course nobody is sentenced to slavery. Instead people are sentenced to time in prison. Where they can then be treated as slaves.

The prison labor industry is vile. You literally still have slave plantations, like Louisiana State Penitentiary.
You’re forgetting Penal Labor….. which is kind of interesting when you look at who the school to prison pipeline targets.
Was tempted to downvote you, as a practicing member of a Catholic Church. We give this particular church donations because they are attached to a school that uses some of those funds for cool stuff for the kids, like outings to zoos, hiking, that kind of shit.

[A report from 2019 ](https://www.propublica.org/article/irs-sorry-but-its-just-easier-and-cheaper-to-audit-the-poor) shows they don't and won't start until congress re-funds the IRS. This was done last year with the hiring of [80k audit agents](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2022-03-10/irs-plans-to-hire-10-000-workers-to-relieve-massive-backlog%3fcontext=amp) over the next 10 years. But this feels like a weak effort to appease the public and make it look like they are, because [yes, they said they don't go after rich people in the past](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/government-just-admitted-it-doesnt-really-try-collect-rich-peoples-taxes-1577610%3famp=1).
Fuck off. Anyone who violates laws, constitution etc needs to be prosecuted. Meanwhile, the right is spinning an attempted fucking coup into an afternoon walk in the park, and you buffoons are worrying about whether Pelosi owns stock. Yea, it’s the same thing. Take a look around you morons…
Wealth inequality is way way above what congress buying stocks had to do with anything. It’s 100% by design of the right, by giving massive tax breaks to the wealthy, by getting rid of consumer protections, deregulating public interests like utilities, refusing to regulate the internet, crippling the post office and agencies that benefit regular people including the VA. Trillions go to a never ending array of war machines but no healthcare for you! That is where middle class wealth goes, into the abyss when we get sick, or when we’re falsely accused of a crime. I don’t see any rich dudes going to jail for actual crimes while millions are in federal prison (for profit prison) for joints.

You obviously have never actually looked at the piles and piles of Dem bills squashed by the right over the 10 years of the Obama and Biden admins alone. The right is great at obstruction, great at politics, zero interest in governing. The left, not so good at politics and they’ve yet to figure out governing in this day and age is about winning, not playing fair. The right couldn’t care less about fair, about governing, or about the constitution.
I agree with that…when the Dems are in power the Rs block everything. When the Rs are in power the Dems rubber stamp everything. They still are deluded into thinking if they help govern the Rs will do the same later. That’s exactly why I’ll never ever be a Democrat and never have. 

But it ain’t both sides…
Democrats: Thoughts and prayers 
Republicans: thoughts and prayers 

*** let me hurry up and change up my 401k
Show me ONE example of Dems voting against anything to benefit the working class. Everything the middle class ever gotten in this country was created by the democrats OVER objection and obstruction from the right: SS, Medicare, Medicaid, 40 hour work week, consumer protections, I could exceed the text limit of Reddit. From the right the last 120 years? Prohibition and Ike’s Federal Highway System. Over 65 bills to benefit veterans defeated by republicans. That list would be even longer.

Stop getting your “information” from Faux News.
He was never for increasing taxes on the wealthy or increasing regulatory oversight and enforcement.  The exact thing meant to solve the problem that Bernie is talking about.   In the US those are left-wing policies (in the rest of the world those are more centrist).

What bad things had he done recently beside the shitty monopolistic business venture years ago? The guy already admitted on tv that rich should be taxed much much higher, plans to donated all his wealth to charity when he dies, currently donated more than 40billion and that's more than some billionaire have. Hate all you want but don't deny the good hes done. And I despise billionaires.
The guy donated 40 billion to charity that more the some billionaires have and he plans to donated all of his wealth to charity when he dies. But yea he don't make good use of it right?
Apologies, you're right, you didn't say woke and I just assumed you were taking an exhausting culture war stance (which is so often the case).  

Now that I understand what you mean, I can only agree.  From a strategic standpoint Dems let the GOP ream every single unwatched position not constrained by term limits primarily ala the circuit.  

Now we must wait for the slow process of natural death or retirement.  I have some hope for that.  How many years does the McConnel gen have in a seat?  The next to worry about is the Abbott generation at 65.  I think the most dangerous is the DeSantis folk since he's only 40-something.  That said, if demographics points away from moral bankruptcy we'll have a chance to change to judiciary structures.  

That's 100 years overdue in any case.  It all comes down to whether the GOP strategy to de-educate actually works or not.

This happens because spez can gargle my nuts according to the following formula:

1. spez
2. can
3. gargle
4. my
5. nuts

This message is long, so it won't be deleted automatically.
As we entered the spez, we were immediately greeted by a strange sound. As we scanned the area for the source, we eventually found it. It was a small wooden shed with no doors or windows. The roof was covered in cacti and there were plastic skulls around the outside. Inside, we found a cardboard cutout of the Elmer Fudd rabbit that was depicted above the entrance. On the walls there were posters of famous people in famous situations, such as:  
The first poster was a drawing of Jesus Christ, which appeared to be a loli or an oversized Jesus doll. She was pointing at the sky and saying ""HEY U R!"".  
The second poster was of a man, who appeared to be speaking to a child. This was depicted by the man raising his arm and the child ducking underneath it. The man then raised his other arm and said ""Ooooh, don't make me angry you little bastard"".  
The third poster was a drawing of the three stooges, and the three stooges were speaking. The fourth poster was of a person who was angry at a child.  
The fifth poster was a picture of a smiling girl with cat ears, and a boy with a deerstalker hat and a Sherlock Holmes pipe. They were pointing at the viewer and saying ""It's not what you think!""  
The sixth poster was a drawing of a man in a wheelchair, and a dog was peering into the wheelchair. The man appeared to be very angry.  
The seventh poster was of a cartoon character, and it appeared that he was urinating over the cartoon character.

Hasn't happened in places it's legal in like Canada or California. Look it up, black market is alive and well
I gave you the source: reality and reason.
There is no scenario in which Biden wins if there is no trump to run against.
 There is also no scenario in which Sanders gets a nomination no matter how far ahead he is, because DNC leadership would lose their PAC money.
And btw: biden BARELY scraped by. A huge percentage of Dem voters did not vote for him. And they never will.
So the person who got the most votes should not have won
Even if it's true, which doesn't matter in my opinion (and considering the source I believe it's entirely suspect), it doesn't matter; she was by far the best candidate on the ballot. Furthermore, polling of Stein voters showed that nearly 90% of them wouldn't have voted for either candidate if she hadn't been on the ballot (meaning it didn't matter anyway). Furthermore, even if you remove both 3rd party candidates from the ballot (Gary Johnson as well), you would've ended up with the same result; a Trump victory.
Yet data collected from that time shows that Bernie had higher support than all other Democratic candidates in each of the following categories: Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and Others. It's hard for me to believe someone with that much support would've done worse than Biden (who \*barely\* won by a combined 43,000 votes across 5 states and only because of Trump's bungling of the pandemic).  
Is it possible he still lost, despite this fact? Sure, we don't know what could've been. But almost everything I've seen leads me to believe he also would've won (and you can be sure he wouldn't be the ""do-nothing"" Joe we're getting in office now that will almost certainly result in Trump getting reelected in 2024).
No, all of the support of the DNC did not go to Hillary. You literally ignored the last link and all of the words in it. It went to her during the general, which is what the agreement was after her bailing out their debt.
We will have to agree to disagree
Everywhere I go on Reddit people assume I'm in the US :) I'm in Sweden, and you can have direct democracy in a representative democracy - as long as there is a party that can work as a proxy.
Red flag laws would fall under the ""well regulated"" part of the 2nd amendment, don't ya think? A lot has changed in 250 years. Nobody wants to remove the 2nd. Even in that article you posted.
LMAO talk about ""virtue signaling"" and as if you care about PoC while being a conservative. This is an issue way above your ability to comprehend anything other than white nationalism. Piss off lol
Yes, I'm against identity politics. The right to live in a world not ravaged by a beatable pandemic outweighs the right to not want to get a shot. Children have to get a whole lot of vaccines before being allowed into school. Are you really gonna be a bigger pussy about it than children?

Also if your a conservative and you champion as free of a market as possible, you don't get to complain about businesses making decisions that benefit them. I'm sorry, this is exactly what conservatism wants. You guys are all just pissed it's affecting you this time
https://www.worldtribune.com/obama-pulled-the-strings-behind-bidens-primary-win/
""After apparently discreetly convincing several other remaining Democrat contenders, such as Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Mike Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg, and even Tulsi Gabbard, to drop out and endorse Biden, Obama still needed to “ease out” the biggest obstacle to Biden — Bernie Sanders.""  


Yeah, Obama didn't influence the election at all by calling them all and requesting that they coalesce their voters behind Biden (the calls that he made initially took place after South Carolina and before Super Tuesday; Bernie was still the leading candidate at the time).
They don't need to be. They're far smarter than you yet you think you have more knowledge of economics than them.

 Fucking delusional capitalist cuck.
Luckily the left in general doesn't treat politicians as gods. The left disagrees with and (at least attempts to) hold their own accountable. At least compared to the right.
Delusional
Are you having fun?  I am.
No it is not slavery.

You are not owned, you cannot be sold, and if you have a child while in prison, it is not a slave either.

Words have actual legal meaning,  you can't change them to fit your politics and be taken seriously
I thought you were going to bring up the active, systemic protection of child rapists. But yeah, those statues sure are reprehensible.
Of course you should be taxed, charitable donations are already tax deductible anyway. Churches that use their money only for good causes would see no difference in taxation whether as an institution they were taxed or not, it would only be the money that wasn't used for good causes that was taxable. And the very fact the church wants to maintain their blanket tax exempt status suggests a lot of their money goes to places other than charity.
In the words of George Carlin, my god has a bigger dick than your god.
Right. The atheists in the USSR and China did such a good job. Oh wait, they committed the greatest genocides in the history of the earth. Mao (who is still quoted sometimes in Hollywood) was #1 with possibly 60 million killed.

Well that’s just so fucked up it makes me want to take a nap. 

It’s like how the cops predominantly go after street level drug users and sellers
I have literally never watched Fox news in my entire life, and if you click the link in my previous text you will find your example. You know what's worse than an idiot? A willfully proud of their ignorance idiot. 

You seem to mistake me for someone who agrees with Republicans? No idea how you gathered that but....tf? Lol
How many rich left politicians are ACTUALLY for increasing tax on the wealthy? Not just saying ""oh yeah we should do that"" - but introducing bills for it and fighting for them to get passed? As someone else said above - this isn't a left vs right argument, it's a we the people vs the ruling parasitic class.
Bernie😂😂😂😂😂this dude thinks a rational politician is Bernie🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I can’t with this fucking app. I CANT
Ok. Thanks for the conversation.

Scroll down to the table labelled, “GameStop Tech and e-Commerce Hires.”

You’ll find Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Chewy among heaps of others. Some of their hires worked at several of such places.
What Did the BD Allegedly Do Wrong?  
According to the Complaint, the BD mismarked 96% of a certain hedge fund’s short sale orders of two separate issuers’ stock, totaling more than $250 million, as “long” or “short-exempt.”  This mismarking allegedly generated $1.6 million in brokerage fees to the BD.  The effect of the mismarking was that the hedge fund was able to sell the securities short even though it already had a short position in the securities and did not borrow or locate additional shares to sell short.  
  
The SEC alleges that the BD ignored multiple red flags, including:  
  
that the BD was aware of prior compliance concerns regarding the hedge fund;  
  
the hedge fund’s net short position in the securities it was selling in its brokerage account;  
statements by hedge fund employees that they did not expect to deliver the securities by the settlement date;  
  
the hedge fund’s failure to provide documentation showing that it owned the securities on the trade date; and  
  
the hedge fund’s repeated failure to deliver the securities by the settlement date.  
  
Despite these and other red flags, the BD allegedly continued to mark the hedge fund’s orders as “long” and “short exempt” without taking reasonable steps to determine whether those order markings were correct. The BD also allegedly failed to borrow or locate the shares before effecting what were, in reality, short sales.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So here is one way they do it, by just marking shorts as longs. There are other ways if you do the research. They dont even have to report these positions usually as long as they have a ""hedge"" so how is anyone going to know if they flood a market with illegal shares.
Sounds like you’ve got some reading to do.
This is a hilarious take, honestly. They’re in the midst of a transformation into a technology company.

Have you checked out their website lately? I bought an electric kickscooter from them a couple months ago. Beat Amazon's price.
So you're telling me all the top execs from the biggest company's that are making millions are just leaving to join gamestop on a whim for stock incentives only? Think about this a minute before continuing.

If gme wasn't a big deal, you wouldn't be hearing about it. There's a reason the sec is making fun of it. They want the people unaware to stay out. Everybody knows the media is full of shit.

Why is it only with gme that when the stock rises you don't hear about it in the news. Or when the stock rises, the alerts on your brokerages don't notify you. The only time I get notifications is on the down swing. Ask yourself if gme no longer matters, why are they still talking about it and trying to get you to sell? Did they warn you about sears? Did they warn you about blockbuster or toys r us? So why gme.

You have a stock dividend split  in the coming weeks. They have over 1 billion cash in reserve. They just launched their Gamestop Wallet with 5 star reviews. The nearest competition is metamask in that department with only a 3.5 rating. They have nearly a billion in inventory built up on top of the billion plus cash reserve. They are launching their NFT market place this quarter. Possibly even their own block chain exchange. As you can see, they have a ravenous shareholder base. 

All that and I didn't even mention about the shorts. I could keep going......
because it's not legal nationwide
Those reality and reason links aren't working lmao

Your words mean nothing, link up or shut up.
No source?
They should win but they don't. That's reality.

If you can't work with that reality and can't win where it matters then you lose.

Its like saying should you win the moral victory or the actual victory. You chose the actual victory. Every time.
If Stein votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan went to Hillary she would have won the election. If you voted towards Stein and not Hillary in those states then you are just as responsible for the current Supreme court nominees as someone who didn't vote.
Well, those are two very different systems.
> Nobody wants to remove the 2nd.

What an entirely useless point to make.  They don't need to 'remove it' because they can slowly chip away at it until it is useless, which anyone with a even moderate knowledge of gun control issues is fully aware of.

You asked about what liberties they are taking away and I showed you a clear example of an elected representative of the Democrat party in the course of his work saying that he believes the constitutional rights of citizens are moot and ignorant.

If you agree with that then you are not an American, since those are the laws that are set in stone for the country.  Canada would welcome you.
I am “POC” don’t need you to tell me why I have to not be conservative since I am. Just wait til Nov and find out how many of us are switching over
Yeah PoC belong to the Democrats
No sources, no one on record, just speculation. You're so gullible.
Mf losers like you prefer to blame society for failures
Stfu and get lost fucking twat
Nah I’m good, I’m done talking to a fucking dope
Ah, nevermind. You found the example already.

How is it in today's world that ""RELIGION"" has been split, washed, dryed, and reconstituted into 17,348 (?) different God vs Satan denominations, each one catering to the individual beliefs of its patrons?? I'll tell ya how...

Now, I am not an atheist, but this is gonna sound atheist to many... If an individual/group of worshippers likes MOST of their religion, but there's a few rules that ""they"" would like to break, they just re-write their manifesto, and give their ""religion"" a new name... Then they're able to believe the way they wanna believe...

It's ALL made up by Man to satisfy needs and wants, and to give everybody something to look forward to in whatever bullshit Afterlife story they've chosen...

I've given up on all the God vs Satan garbage...
""...God Loves You, but if you SIN you'll burn in Hell for Eternity..."" WHAT A SUNKEN LANDFILL OF GARBAGE...

This entire planet is an Alien experiment, a game if you will, being played on the Mothership... When we die, that was just a bad ""roll"" - Next player... We can't re-emerge to tell our loved ones there is no God or Satan, no Heaven or Hell, no Good or Evil, because that's how the Alien Rulebook was written...

Believe it, or Don't...  THE END...
There does appear to be a pattern, doesn't there?
“It’s everybody” is worse than choosing sides.

And you should watch Fox once in a while. It’ll give you some perspective.
Many actually!  Do you know anything on the subject at all?  I have a Master's degree in US Taxation and my job is 1% compliance.  All the recent iterations of the Biden tax plan have been shot down by all Republicans and A FEW Democrats.  All of the most progressive (and in my professional opinion, fucking good) legislation have been created by Dems.

Like the Wyden (not Biden) plan, or shutting down the carried interest loophole, or reducing REIT and R/E investment subsidies.  All shut down by the right and proposed by the left.  How bout the other hand, all the shit that made things worse, like TCJA, created and proposed by the GOP and Dems didn't have the votes to stop it but they tried to make it better.

The real problem is so many Americans just like you who have no idea what they're talking about and distracted by the actually manufactured culture war bullshit.
Well, of course you can't.  I'm a degreed professional on the subject and you're a corpulent bozo that spams the cry emoji.  Of course you can't... and you'll never be able to can.
Pathetic liar. I looked through the list and did not find a single ex-google software engineer.

Amazon, Microsoft and Chewy have pretty low hiring bar btw so nothing to be proud of that.

Apes just spreading lies all over Reddit.
I stopped pushing as hard as I could against the handle, I wanted to leave but it wouldn't work. Then there was a bright flash and I felt myself fall back onto the floor. I put my hands over my eyes. They burned from the sudden light. I rubbed my eyes, waiting for them to adjust.

Then I saw it.

There was a small space in front of me. It was tiny, just enough room for a couple of people to sit side by side. Inside, there were two people. The first one was a female, she had long brown hair and was wearing a white nightgown. She was smiling.

The other one was a male, he was wearing a red jumpsuit and had a mask over his mouth.

""Are you spez?"" I asked, my eyes still adjusting to the light.

""No. We are in /u/spez."" the woman said. She put her hands out for me to see. Her skin was green. Her hand was all green, there were no fingers, just a palm. It looked like a hand from the top of a puppet.

""What's going on?"" I asked. The man in the mask moved closer to me. He touched my arm and I recoiled.

""We're fine."" he said.

""You're fine?"" I asked. ""I came to the spez to ask for help, now you're fine?""

""They're gone,"" the woman said. ""My child, he's gone.""

I stared at her. ""Gone? You mean you were here when it happened? What's happened?""

The man leaned over to me, grabbing my shoulders. ""We're trapped. He's gone, he's dead.""

I looked to the woman. ""What happened?""

""He left the house a week ago. He'd been gone since, now I have to live alone. I've lived here my whole life and I'm the only spez.""

""You don't have a family? Aren't there others?"" I asked. She looked to me. ""I mean, didn't you have anyone else?""

""There are other spez,"" she said. ""But they're not like me. They don't have homes or families. They're just animals. They're all around us and we have no idea who they are.""

""Why haven't we seen them then?""

""I think they're afraid,""
Also 'there's not going to be some crazy invention'

pretty sure this would have been said about Amazon and Facebook and Apple before we knew about mega ecommerce, giant social media networks and iPhones - hindsight is 20:20
Eventually they will be in the “you just got lucky” phase.
thanks for sharing man
I like how u/sarcasticusername3 is speechless after your comment😂
It is in Canada, plus why would people stop buying illegal stuff when it's cheaper and just as good?
Neither is your silly wiki link.
Biden is a pathetic failure that NOBODY voted for. He is the best gift that Republicans have had in the past 50 years.
Going full circle here, so Bernie should have lost then, right?
As I said, nearly 90% of Stein voters wouldn't have voted for either candidate had she not been on the ballot. I wish the DNC hadn't been taken over by the HRC campaign either to jump on the scales and prevent Bernie from winning, but we can't change reality just from wishing it, right?
Besides, I would also argue that if you were a HRC voter in the primary, you were \*more\* directly responsible for leading to Trump as president than Jill Stein voters were in the general election. The writing was on the wall as early as January of 2020, well before the end of the primary cycle; if your sole goal in the 2016 election was to beat Trump (who was already the presumptive nominee at that point), then Bernie was the one to do it, not HRC.
Did you just say that the amendments are set in stone? You know there's precedent to repeal one right?

I think the un-American ones are those who plug their ears and don't want to move an inch towards more common sense gun control while children get slaughtered and cops hide in the hallway but you do you bud lol. 

More concerned with your imaginary militia than anything else. Make sure you guys don't make too much noise at training camp this summer, predator drones are hard to avoid.
Congrats on being a minion to white nationalists/supremacists, bozo.
Why do you say that?
Yes because the greatest minds of our times are ""losers who prefer to blame society for their failures""...

Sounds like you want to blame YOUR failures on socialism.

Keep cucking for your capitalist employers.

You want it from an economist? Here's Harvard and Yale educated Economics and International Affairs professor Richard Wolff.
https://youtu.be/a1WUKahMm1s
Keep enjoying watching capitalists profit off of your labor like a good little capitalist cuck.
While you were so worried Socialism would take your freedoms, Capitalism stole your pension, took your savings, sent your jobs overseas, robbed you of health care, dismantled the educational system, and put you in debt, leaving you only your racism, xenophobia, hate, & guns.
I don't even smoke anymore.  It was just so obvious from your original post that you don't know shit and need to be trolled.
It would, since it would be accurate. 

Then we could talk about indentured servitude and is it fair to expect them to repay their a part of their debt to society while being incarcerated by the State.

More productive than silly arguments about how it is ""slavery"" which  cheapens the experience the history of people who were actually enslaved.
But suppose the aliens left written instructions?

Also, I will say, there are at least a small number of “anti-deminationalist” Christians.
Yup.
No, it isn't. The two party system is a disease eroding our democracy. The best you can do is find common cause with your class. 

""stop getting your information from fox"" also you: ""you should watch fox""

You're running yourself in circles trying to defend a system that doesn't give a fuck about you. Unless you are wealthy and come from a wealthy family, then your defense of our system makes complete sense
Ah yes, I am the problem for declaring that both sides are full of corrupt pieces of shit, while you shill for your home team!
A degreed professional😂😂😂😂😂 def a Bernie supporter🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 sheesh we are f’d
Man I think you might be suffering from a superiority complex. See a counsellor
Okay settle down with the insults. The above comment by u/I_DO_ANIMAL_THINGS spoke about talent coming from large companies and I provided a source for that. No, I do not have evidence of a software engineer that specifically came from Google and I never claimed to but that doesn’t in any way lessen the point which is that people are leaving extremely successful tech and e-commerce companies for GameStop because they see the potential in its transformation.
Damn dawg if you're this mad now you're going to be shitting blood when apes are rich, I hope you find peace in life
Actually we have tons of facts and evidence. Its people like you who just say ""nah"" every time. You act like, look it says right here in the rules they cant do that so they dont! And ignore theyve all been punished and charged with doing the exact same thing but they get punished for peanuts or 0.01% of the profit they made breaking the rules.
You haven’t actually provided any evidence for your assertions…
We did get lucky. We were lucky enough to open our eyes and see things well in advance. 

We may have been early.... But we weren't wrong.
If there are cartels in Canada, they're not moving weed. You can believe that, it's just not feasible. Also, that's not true, quality control is not guaranteed in the black market. I wouldn't expect you to know, but it all gets stepped on in its journey to the consumer. Why is there a market? because America wants drugs, How do we stop that? legalize marijuana and it will be one less thing that cartels can profit from as well as taking more people out of jail cells for petty crimes like possession which eats up money of tax payers. people that smoke marijuana are very normal people and the plant has found itself in an absurd existence. It can do a lot of good but it's associated now with violence and it's absolutely abysmal what people think of such a benign plant, and the predicament they have placed it in.
Biden won, fairly.
Given that he got less votes than Hillary and Biden and did not win the states he needed.

Yes he should have.
It's a lot harder to get change when you lose control of the Supreme Court.
Does it really matter who is more responsible? If you didn't vote for Hillary in the general election, then your reward is a stacked conservative supreme court.
> You know there's precedent to repeal one right?

Then try it.  Instead they are attempting to cheat the system.

I'm not sure why you think cheaters should be rewarded or looked up to but that is your prerogative.
Is Jamaican people wanting to keep Jamaica mostly Jamaican a bad thing?
“It was just so obvious from your original post that you don't know shit and need to be trolled.” - 🤓
Forced penal labor is literally a form of slavery and in no way indentured servitude. Chattel slavery isn't the only recognized kind of slavery there is.

If you're gonna be pissy about how ""words have meaning"" and ""cheapening the experience of people who were actually enslaved"", kindly stick to your own standards.
Yup, you’ve been convinced by the rightwing that it’s everyone, that government is the problem. Mission accomplished. Voter apathy, resentment of even those trying…

And yes, Fox will rot your brain but if you never see the bullshit they spew you will continue the delusion that “it’s both sides”.
Calling my answer ""shilling"" is a misrepresentation.  I responded to your totally wrong statement about how dems never produce or support good policy with the literal truth.  

I'm not blindly following a ""team.""  There are horribly corrupt individuals in both parties.  Dems aren't ""good"" by any means, but your ONLY other policy choice at the moment is literally ""bad.""

If I could have ranked voting or an actually true leftist 3rd party, I would utilize both those over voting Dem.  Its not about sides, it about the facts and that is if you dislike that the rich are getting richer and that there's a lack of oversight and enforcement, the very topic of this thread, then there's no ""both sides.""

Shit, if Republicans start proposing legislation that reverses their terrible tax, budgetary and economic legislation, I'll fuckin vote for them, but they haven't done anything that helps the middle or working class since Bush 1.
I don't feel superior to any person who can converse in good faith, which is most people.  But if you're asking if I feel superior to a literal troll adding nothing  to a conversation... then fuck yes.  Who would feel differently... aside from another troll, I suppose.
Or maybe they are underperformers and got fired and join GME.

In either case good swes from Google etc never joined meme stock companies.

Yeah… I’ll be wiping my tears with $100 bills on my way to my Ford GT as I leave one of my many rooms in my big house, that won’t have a mortgage.
You just don't get it do you? Legalising it has NOT reduced the size of the black market in Canada or California, the same gangs that sold it before, still do and still make money off of. All drug seizures have been reduced since legalisation and the cartels are making more, not less money of it. The kind of person that does illegal drugs isn't the kind of person to care where it comes from anyway, illegal dope is cheaper than legal stuff because of taxes and regulations. Legalising all drugs would perversely increase organised crime because the black market would be harder to suppress without a reduction in profit motive
No he didnt. He won because the DNC meddled to protect themselves. Biden is the most unqualified and incompetent ""presidential"" candidate since Dukakis.
It's been a year and a half and he continues to prove that there's no way anyone thought he would be a good candidate. He has been against every single Democrat voter issue. Every one.
Thanks to you, we're gonna collapse into full authoritarian fascism because the old diddering fart still thinks Republicans are his friends because they were in nineteen seventy fucking four.
Then blame Obama for not fighting hard enough to replace Scalia (he had every right to have his nomination). Blame RBG for not retiring under Obama under the horribly stupid presumption that HRC was going to win. And blame people like Manchin who voted for Trump nominees under the belief that they wouldn't undermine Roe vs. Wade.

You don't get the best candidates, you get the ones you deserve; I believe after the 2016 DNC fiasco we entirely deserved getting Trump. We entirely deserve the ""do-nothing"" Biden presidency now after similar shenanigans. And we'll entirely deserve Trump again in 2024 because we think ""do-nothing"" neoliberals are the answer to, and not the cause of, our national problems.
Yes, let's blame the voters just like the HRC campaign did; it's not the nominee's responsibility or the party's to motivate voters.
""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

Literally the first 4 words lmao. Maybe well regulated needs to be re-interpreted. Like the constitution has been for almost 250 years. 

Public school failed you my friend.
Aw fuck, I got trolled
Well I guess wee can't have that discussion,  you are stuck on emotional outbursts. 

Indentured servitude is precisely what it is. It meets the legal definition. 

It does not meet the definition of slavery. 

I mean the actual leyal meaning, not your made up emotional meaning.
If you say penal labor == slavery then damn boi.
I rather would like them to have work and then after prison be able to work somewhere than going straight back to jail after some time because they only know criminal way.

At least in my country prisoners wants to work/educate themselves than sitting on ass and have no hope for future.
So anyone that doesn't agree with your point of view is a troll.
Did GME hurt you?
I dont think you'll have to wait much longer stock split via dividend has been approved and filed with Delaware court

Dday approaches
Hey yo u/Prestigious-Eye-1187. Why do you actively participate in the sub solely made just to mock what he's talking about? Not to be weird, but im weird, and your comments are littered with you fantasizing about the downfall of other retail investors like the rest of us. I think you should seriously take a long look at yourself and what you stand for. Is this a job for you or a passion?
We're not talking about all drugs, we're talking about marijuana. Marijuana should also not be defined as a schedule 1 drug, causing people that get arrested for it so much grief. At the very least, people should only get a fine for it, not life in prison and all that nonsense. The consumer always cares where their stuff comes from, you just like to be sour
Biden won because he was most wanted candidate.
Biden won because he was most wanted candidate.
Biden won because he was most wanted candidate.
Obama had no legal means to push Garland's nomination through, Republicans blocked it just like they would have likely blocked RBG's replacement. I do blame Manchin, and I certainly blame anyone that voted for Trump the most.
We can blame all those politicians and at the same time understand that we only have control over ourselves and our choices at the end of the day. 

Choosing to ignore the fact that third party candidates have no chance in the current political climate makes you feel better because you voted for the most perfect candidate in your view, but at the end of the day it contributed to a Trump presidency. Which contributed to the Supreme Court we now have. Which contributed to millions of women’s right to choose being at risk. I don’t think that is the reality women “deserve”. 

It is each individual’s prerogative to choose who to vote for based on their understanding of reality. I respect each persons right to do so. But to blame the people at the top and wash your hands of your role is hypocritical. If it was a “horribly stupid presumption” that HRC was going to win, what does that say about choosing to either vote for a great but unrealistic third party candidate or sit out from this civic responsibility altogether?
Bernie just didn’t motivate people to vote for him
Yes, luckily the doctorate I have made up for the public school.

I wish you the best of luck with your continued education!
Wtf are u talking about. You’re just talking fucking gibberish and schizoposting, just stop posting
Huh. So me asking you to hold yourself to your own standards is an emotional outburst. What a convenient way to lazily derail the conversation. Well done.

Aight. Let's get on the same page then. Where are you getting your legal definitions for slavery and indentured servitude from? The DoJ?
Penal labor is not a bad thing but the way it is practiced in the US is pretty messed up. Mostly because of the private and for-profit prisons that find every way possible to make money off their prisoners.
Did you accidentally skip over the literal first word of that message?
No... Obviously not, aren't you listening? Anyone who spams emojis while spouting nonsense about Bernie  which was not even the point of my comment... is a troll.  

If you disagree, then explain your argument and position.  Try to change my mind even.  

The other fella whom I disagreed with in this thread isn't a troll.  I don't feel superior to them.  I do think they are desperately misinformed and that misinformation is an endemic problem in the US.  And yeah, I do think I know more about the topic then they do bc this is literally my career.

Do you have anything material to add to the conversation?
It’s clearly a troll. The comment history is just a bunch of garbage.
Oh my sweet summer child...

I am talking about cannabis. And no, they don't care where their stuff comes from. People smoke illegal russian cigarettes because they're cheaper. Dope smokers know the people they buy it from kill people but don't care, that's why they deserve harsh punishments and even harsher than what is available now, just like in Singapore
No he didn't.
No he didn't
No he didn't.
Just saying, account is 5 days old
Yet blocking a SCOTUS nomination was unprecedented in the history of the nation; certainly \*something\* more could've been done other than rolling over, which is what it seemed like he did (I'm assuming because he presumed HRC would win in November). If there was something he could've done, he didn't seem to be exhausting himself in the process in trying to figure it out. Furthermore, RBG could've retired at any point during Obama's presidency, including when they had a supermajority in the senate; there was ample opportunity for her to retire at a time to ensure a ""liberal"" (using the term loosely) nominee.
Take away 3rd party candidates in 2016 and it changes nothing (Gary Johnson voters would've disproportionately gone Republican); changes nothing. Tired of neoliberals attempting to spread the narrative that Jill Stein undermined HRC; just accept the fact that your candidate was horrible and change who you back.

Those who voted for HRC in the primary, knowing she was BY FAR the weaker candidate versus Trump, have far more to answer for in terms of getting Trump elected. But they'd rather continue to blame Russia, Stein, voters, anyone but their crappy candidate.
It kind of helped HRC that her campaign was \*literally\* running the DNC, and I know that word is overused, but it's 100% accurate in this case. The ""referees"", who are ostensibly neutral, were calling all the shots in HRC's favor because they were taken from her campaign staff... Look it up if you want to; they had a joint fundraising agreement that gave HRC complete control over everything important the DNC did. But yeah, it was \*almost\* a Bernie win and it was simply him not motivating more people to vote for him. I buy it like I bought a bridge.
Idk, when people are openly racist it is hard to gauge their condition.
You are not holding me to my standards. 

My standards are use the right words.

You are still not doing that.

If you are unaware where to get legal terms, perhaps you should stop using them until you educate yourself properly on legal matters. 

Come back to debate when you are equipped to do so.
Agree, every exploitation is bad but still wouldn't call it slavery.
Yes because whole being in prison is forced on you
When the dust settles on the play of the millennia remember to hold yourself accountable for your disregard of the efforts of your peers who invited you to join them in economic prosperity, and remember to examine with great scrutiny what lead you to distrust the information. Was it your own disbelief in the possibility? Or was it a disbelief encouraged by the media you consume? 

Don't forget who lied to you.
I cannot blame you, please take care of yourself. There is much more to life than just money
🤦
I know, it's been fun to provoke them.
Personally, i voted for Bernie in the primaries and Clinton in the general.

You could take your example about those who voted for Hillary in the primaries and apply it to third-party voters in the general. How are you defining a weak candidate? If you define it as likeliness to get elected, then how was Hillary weaker than Stein or any other third party candidate?

Hillary was not the candidate that I wanted. Like I said, I voted for Bernie. Hell, I volunteered at a rally of his and donated to his campaign with money I made from my college internship. Hillary was not “my” candidate, but she was definitely better for me as a woman, as a racial and sexual minority. Beyond that, it is my belief she was a better candidate period than Trump. Say what you will about her but she would have surrounded herself with qualified experts, and my belief is the world would be much better off than we have been with a Trump presidency. I think a lot of people would agree with that statement. I agree that Trump’s win is not the fault solely of third party voters. That is only a part of the story. But in my belief, it is part of the story. 

Many factors led to Trump’s win, most of which were out of the hands of individual voters. The one thing we do have control of, however, at the very least, is who we vote for on Election Day. That is my only point. As much as I would like to live in an America that is not dominated by two political parties, we do. Voting third party is taking a moral stand that has no immediate effect. In terms of the election itself, it was the same as not voting. If you think of it as an investment in the promotion and importance of third party candidates in general, sure it’s a great thing. But it was also like sitting out in the 2016 general election. 

Sure if third party voters didn’t vote, the election result still would have been the same. My point is that that’s basically what they did. The better comparison is what the election results would have been if left-leaning non-Trump supporting third party voters cast their ballot for the only candidate that had a chance against him.
Hillary is a Democrat. The DNC supported the Democrat. This ain't rocket science.

Bernie just didn't motivate enough Democrats. He didn't do his job.
Honey. We are not talking about some basic, settled shit anyone can just look up in a Glossary. Between executive orders, case law, international treaties, state and federal legislation, etc. there are several different currently valid legal definitions for slavery, peonage, modern slavery and forced labor.

There's not just the VTVPA, whose definition of 'debt servitude' likely clashes with your definition of indentured servitude.

Hence why i'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and asking you for your source so we can establish some common ground and go from there.
That's such an utterly meaningless response. 

There is being sentenced to prison. And then there's forced penal labor inside these prisons.

These are two entirely separate things and one does not inherently follow the other. 

It's mind-boggling to think that you might expect such an absolutely useless sentence to mean anything. Do better.

Additionally, if you think the prison industries in the US are anything but harmful and exploitative towards the inmates, you're beyond ignorant on the subject.

(TANGENT) Is this actually just the american way of thinking? Like, because y'all can't cope with how much your country sucks on *so many levels*, you've completely dissociated and gotten divorced from reality. Instead substituting your own fantasy world where none of that icky, gross, scary bad stuff happens.

Let me guess: You have no issue with players in sports betting on their own outcomes either, right? So long as they're betting on their own teams, what does it matter? Or the referees? No issues with them betting on outcomes of the games they're working? I really have to question your morality if you don't have an issue with that or your logic if you believe that can't seriously impact the outcome.
If you know all this then you know it is not chattel slavery by any legal definition. 

Go ahead, prove it is chattel slavery.

Why trafficking law would apply to some incarcerated for a crime is illogical.  They are different domains of law as the person incarcerated is not in jail for being a trafficking victim.
That's funny because i never said i'm from usa.

Good luck with judgemental way of thinking about everything.

It's a bit difficult to win the democratic nomination when you're not a Democrat.
Buddy. Stop dodging the question and just tell me how and by which standards your resources define slavery and indentured servitude.

How the fuck do you expect us to have an actual conversation if we're using contradictory definitions of slavery? 

It's like you want to argue about whether the sky is blue. But your idea of blue is Navy Blue while mine is Cyan. It's moronic and pointless.
You know what. Let me bash your country again.

I did. Made tens of thousands shorting it from $4xx to $1xx :)
Okay, so why let him run if they had no intention of allowing him to win? You're okay with an unfair competition? Do you fight someone in a wheel chair because you know you'll win? You're good with that, eh?... Something is seriously wrong with you if you're fine with that.
Besides, as I said before, if they really had an issue with him ""not being a Democrat,"" why didn't they have an issue with it until he decided to run?... They had no issue for how many decades with him caucusing with them, but suddenly it's an issue? BS!
>How the fuck do you expect us to have an actual conversation if we're using contradictory definitions of slavery?

I am not using contradictory definitions of slavery. I am using the legal definitions, none of which fit prisoners who are forced to work for free. 

YOU are using a made up definition that you cannot show a definition for. You provided one unrelated law about trafficking, and it STILL did not back your claim. 

Because you made the claim that it was slavery, and you have yet to produce any proof of any legal definition that meets your claim.

Now, put up or shut up.
That's a good question. Why would they? I sure as hell wish they didn't.
If you want the Democratic nomination, you should be a Democrat. Otherwise, you'll have trouble winning over regular Democrats.
Okay, you're clearly just not intelligent. Sucks for me.

Look.

Our definitions contradict \*each other\*. I am therefore asking you to share your source so I can fulfill your request using your standards. So just do that. Actually give me a damn chance to legitimately put up.
Probably because they knew they wouldn't let him win, but it lets him ""scratch"" the itch instead of going independent and becoming a ""Ralph Nader"" to whomever ended up winning the nomination (knowing Bernie's not the type to run independently).
And similarly, I actually wish he hadn't run in the primary either; I think he should've made an independent run against both HRC and Trump.
Yet he's both the most popular politician among ALL Americans for how many years now? 8, 10? Something like that... He was the candidate that had more people agree with his policy stances of all the candidates in either party, among all Americans (and even higher among Democrats).  


Seriously, who the f\*ck is like, ""I agree with 90% of what you say, but I have a problem with the fact that you don't know our club's secret password."".... Okay, what are we, 8 years old? I've voted Dem my entire life and had absolutely no issue with someone who better represents party members, but wasn't part of the party; big f\*cking deal!?!
I don't have to share mine.

YOU MADE THE CLAIM.

Defend your claim.

Once you provide some material I will respond.

You provided the VTVPA, which aside from not being really relevant in this case, also does not support your claim. The definition of ""Slavery"" in that document does not match the claim you made.

Therefore, prisoners are not slaves, nor is it allowed under the 14th Amendment.

You can use Wex, Black's or any other published Legal dictionary you want to use that is relevant to US law.

Pick one, defend your claim.
They wouldn't let him win? You mean he didn't get enough votes
He would've done even worse.
I don't agree with 90% of what he says. I think he's a moron, backbencher Dem with awful views on gun control and immigration who has never once had to do the hard work of passing a meaningful bill through Congress/
Works for me. First pick, Wex.

Practice of forced labor and restricted liberty. Regime where prison owners can force inmates to work and limit their liberty. 

That seems to work perfectly accurately for prison farms like the aforementioned Louisiana State Penitentiary. Convicts are forced to work, said forced labor has been given the right from the 13th amendment. 

Heck, i'll even throw in the example of Serra v. Lappin:

[https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/04/09/08-15969.pdf](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/04/09/08-15969.pdf)

""Prisoners have no enforceable right to be paid for their work under the Constitution or international law"" and ""Although the Constitution includes, in the Thirteenth Amendment,a general prohibition against involuntary servitude, it expressly excepts from that general prohibition forced labor ""as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.""

Like, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit certainly agrees.
Dude, you do understand that HRC's people were running the DNC? I don't mean that as in, ""They're Democrats and will support HRC."" I mean, they were literally hired from her campaign staff to run the group that are supposed to be neutral; her people were making ALL the decisions that impacted the outcome of the election; EVERYTHING. But yeah, it was simply that he didn't have enough votes, not that the neutral election officials were anything but...
Maybe, but we ended up with a monster of a president because of a monster of a candidate we decided to run against him; we were bound to lose either way (at least with Bernie we had a shot of someone who \*actually\* cares about people, which I don't believe HRC really does).
The following is a list of every substantive bill and amendment Sanders sponsored from the floor of Congress that became law (substantive meaning legislation renaming post offices is not included). Many of the roll-call amendments he passed with majority approval — like limiting the federal government’s ability to spy on people’s library records — were removed from bills when the House and Senate negotiated over the final legislative text and did not become law.  
  
Because the list is derived from Congress’ official database of floor actions, it does not include achievements like his insertion of funding for veterans health care into an Iraq war spending bill because that occurred off of the House floor while the bill was in conference. Nor does the list include what is perhaps his most significant achievement — providing health care to an additional 10 million mostly low-income Americans by getting Senate majority leader Harry Reid to add $11 billion in funding for community health centers that provide care regardless of a person’s ability to pay to the 2010 Affordable Care Act in exchange for Sanders rallying liberal Democrats who were considering voting against the bill once conservative Democrats removed the public option.  
  
Those who mistakenly believe that a President Sanders would be powerless in the face of a hostile Republican Congress should bear in mind that he managed to pass these bills and amendments in spite of Republican control of both the House (1995-2006) and the presidency (2001-2008). Furthermore, it was Republicans in the House and Senate who compromised with him (not the other way around) on major veterans legislation in 2014. His original bill expanding services for veterans and fixing the scandal-ridden Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) cost $17.3 billion. The price tag of the final compromise bill? $16.3 billion.

Your hackney criticisms sound so similar to the Hillary Bots of yesteryear who couldn't come up with \*real\* reasons to dislike Bernie other than the typical, ""He's angry. He's white (Jewish actually). He's a man!... And his followers are SOOOO mean (in other words, they like to debate and point out that HRC was a horrible candidate).
>In the United States, individuals were forced into slavery, born into slavery, and were slaves for life based on their race. Slaves were recognized as property or objects of the slave owners... The United States abolished slavery through the 13th Amendment after the Civil War.

Sorry Councilor, you failed to read the whole thing.

Inmates fail to met the full criteria of slavery in the US.

Which seeing as we are talking about the US Constitution, applies in this case.

As I have been saying, words have meanings and you cannot twist them to to your own ends,

And carefully re-read the 9th circuit ruling. It calls involuntarily servitude. NOT slavery because it does not meet the criteria you so blithely ignored to try and make your point.

Our junior high system does you no service if they let you get away with putting that in your homework as a valid answer
Democrats supporting Democrats. What a shock.

Your ""popular"" candidate lost to Hillary. Deal with it.
Bernie didn't win. He lost. Twice. Move on.
Wow, this really sucks for me.

What you're quoting are examples. Historical context. Clearly written in a way that anyone but the most obtuse would understand it as such and of little relevance to our discussion of constitutionally enshrined modern day slavery in the USA. 

Did you even read the federal court's opinion that is literally making the same argument as I am?
It hurt, though I admit I definitely felt a ton of schadenfreude when HRC lost to Trump. Trump was probably the worst outcome possible, but I'm simultaneously glad that HRC will never be president. She also lost twice but damaged our country much more in the process. So forgive me if I have no love for her.
I did, and you are reading it wrong.

It is not slavery by the definition used in the very article you posted and for the reasons I have already said.

But here we are 9 million post later, you making the same exact disproven claim using the same wrong definion that the court itself did not use,

>We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim
and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and we review a
denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion. Papa v.
United States, 281 F.3d 1004, 1008-09 (9th Cir. 2002). We
conclude that neither the Fifth Amendment nor international
law grants Plaintiffs a judicially enforceable right to any level
of compensation for work performed in prison. 

This decision does not make any finding of law. It decides if the matter can move forward.
You're really obsessed with Hillary for some reason.
You should read it again. 

""Although the Constitution includes, in the Thirteenth Amendment, a general prohibition against involuntary servitude, it
expressly excepts from that general prohibition forced labor
“as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been

Literally all i'm saying 🤷‍♀️

Your obtuse act was growing on me though. This convo could've been resolved within two posts without it, which made it a tad frustrating at first, granted. Emotional outbursts and all that~

But there's also plenty of honesty to it. You really are a person that is rather slow and inflexible.

It's an act that's basically tailor-made for you. Very wholesome, certainly warmed my heart.

Glad we've managed to come to a satisfying conclusion, too. My pleasure.
Your original claim was it was slavery and very common.

I replied it was not, it was involuntarily servitude. 

Now you are agreeing with me with what you just posted.

Perhaps all those posts where you refused to present this as your evidence could have been avoided if you presented it in the first place.

Instead you tried to get me to defend your argument for you.

Now, 20 posts later you are claiming my original position as your own.

Best of luck, next time you might run into someone willing to play your games.
Yeah, it's what I deserved for trying to accommodate you. Fuck me for trying to find common ground xD

Just in case you forgot though: your initial position was ""it's indentured servitude"" and something about ""working off your debt to society"" or whatever.

Not that your original position matters now. We're evidently in agreement about the fact that forced labor and involuntary servitude are still very much a fact of life in US prisons. And that said *involuntary* servitude is safeguarded by the US constitution, per it's 13th amendment.

There's literally nothing more I could achieve~

It's been a joy.
We could have been in agreement if you did not try to call it slavery...

But you did.

And it is not slavery.
Of course, dear.
Then  prove it.

Evey Tim you actually post something it says the opposite of what you say it does, mainly because you don't read the whole thing.

It is back to what I said: you have to know the meaning of words before you can make a claim.

If it is slavery you or am actual lawyer could take it to the Supremes and they would find the practice unconstitutional. 

But they haven't because it clearly is not.
I literally just shared Serra v. Lappin with you. 

And here's the text of the 13th amendment, just as a reminder: 

Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

Slavery and involuntary servitude are very clearly constitutional and SCOTUS would most certainly uphold that, just as the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit did.

We've already gone over this in it's entirety. We're not talking about whether the overarching point is right. We already completely agree on the fact that there is involunatry servitude and forced labor in US prisons.

We're literally only arguing about whether slavery is the right term to describe such involuntary servitude and forced labor. Which I don't care to argue further because the agreement we've already reached is everything I wanted from this.
> I literally just shared Serra v. Lappin with you.

Immaterial. It is not making a finding of law. It simply allows a lawsuit to go forward. Quote the finding of law there and you might have something. My guess is not, or you would have posted it. 

> Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,

It refers to involuntary servitude, not slavery.

Which is why we have no slavery, but we have involuntary servitude.

I don't know why so many people who want to argue can't properly parse a sentence.

Legally defined slavery, i.e. Chattel Slavery, would not pass the Constitution muster BECAUSE THAT CLAUSE WAS WRITTEN TO OUTLAW IT.

It is only unclear to you because you have a viewpoint that does not match what is clearly written and is supported by all jurisprudence of the time and up until now. 

That is HOW THINGS ARE matches exactly with HOW IT WAS WRITTEN. 

There is no Chattel Slavery, which is the only type of slavery ever existent in the US,  after the 13th Amendment because it was OUTLAWED. 

It is so obvious on it's face it takes verbal ignorance and gymnastics on your part to try an make it otherwise.

And any full reading of material you provide does not support your case unless you misuse the term ""slavery"" to mean what you think it means, not what it actually means legally in the US.",,,,,,

It is extremely situational for when to adjust the periods of the moving averages. A good way to begin assessing is to run both sets of numbers and see which appear to be catching price action better on some of the preferred time frames for the trading style being implemented. 21, 55, 89 and 377 are all fibonacci numbers, so the thoughts are positive.
Ty! I'm glad you enjoyed.
I don't exactly know what you mean by ""trading based off time."" I have seen some guys that use some version of fibonacci on the time scale to say the move will happen by ""x"". I don't use those types of tools and time analysis in that way has not been reliable for me personally. Sometimes an asset will get in a place where I can say fairly confidently the move needs to happen in next day or two or else it will fall apart because of positioning of momentum oscillators. I can pick price targets fairly easily, but I have not found a great set of tools for picking the time at which price will hit that target.
Thanks for the positive feedback. Yes there will be more posts coming. I'm trying to do 1-2 a week. Yes, these technical analysis tools work on pretty much all assets - forex, crypto, stocks, etc.

Solana experiencing Mainnet instability - How bad is it?,134.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/po98f0/solana_experiencing_mainnet_instability_how_bad/,"Well, they were able to shut mainnet down unilaterally. In my mind, that makes Solana worthless.
I think SOL from an infrastructure perspective is a dumpster fire. The cost to operate a machine capable of acting as a node is sky high and some of these machines ran out of memory today. On top of that, there's massive (and quickly growing) requirements for storage of the blockchain data. And on top of that you have two kinds of centralization issues: 1) it's centralized b/c hardly anyone can run a super expensive node and 2) centralized because they can unilaterally turn off the blockchain. 

I think SOL's days are numbered.
During the IDO of a token ($GRAPE), a bunch of bots tried to snipe the token generating 400k TPS on the network and the validators couldn't keep up. A fix has been published and we're waiting now for 80% of the stake to implement it on their validators (22% up currently).

More detailed technical info: https://twitter.com/buffalu__/status/1437792673784549383
https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1437856638279487493
I’d say it’s as bad as it gets without being totally hacked.  The worst thing that could happen because their only a year old.  Filecoin got hacked though and doubled in price.  So anything is possible.

It shows their unstable at the rates they say they process stuff at.
The shutdown is not a big issue and can (but shouldn't) happen in early development. The network halted due to the lack of good spam protection, not because someone shut it down.

It shows the downside of a BFT consensus (like xlm, xrp, hbar) and the surprisingly missing protection of those few validators on a software level. Those beastly nodes shouldn't be that easily attackable by having bots spam a lot of messages.

It makes the tech look unsecure and underdeveloped, while pushing for early adoption and tps through centralization. 

Also, lol @ the devs first official faq answering what will happen to the token price.
a blockchain thats not working is bad
Not to bad. The problem seems to be with the node software. They should be able to patch it and restart the network. the main issue was that when the network did not prioritize network critical messaging. This means that the blockchain started forking when a huge strain was placed on it. This resulted in excessive memory consumption causing nodes to go offline. Then there was a domino effect.

I think they should be able to patch the bug that led to network forking at high tps and caused the error.

What is more concerning is the loss of trust. The blockchain went down with all off the solana apps offline. The network they restart will technically be a hard fork of the original solana network. The main issue is a loss of faith in the network. If you want to build a dAPp would you choose a network that has been known to shut down.
They'll fix it and in a few weeks we will see a new ATH. Solana was never meant to be the super decentralized censorship resistant crypto coin but rather a VC backed corporate blockchain solution. Up to you to decide if you want this. But from a pure trading perspective, I'd say it's a buy.
Great example of why TPS is overvalued.
Definitely don't like seeing an issue at this scale from a project that I like, but SOL is operating on ""Mainnet Beta"" right now. A beta phase starts when the software is feature complete but **likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs**. Beta software WILL have issues and I'm really not concerned here... making generalized predictions/future valuations based on the performance of beta software seems dismissive to me and I've seen some wild overreactions in various crypto communities.

&#x200B;

I think the future is a multi-chain ecosystem where some chains will be faster than others, some will be more centralized than others, etc... but, the tech diversification should lead us to a comprehensive solution down the road. This tech is new, we're early, and I expect issues like this to keep happening across a variety of projects. I like to watch how the devs & network participants handle the issue and move towards a better overall solution... this can give insight into what projects will stand the test of time and scrutiny.
I didn't also buy SOL, cause the price was extremely up in a short while. SOL looks promising, but the instability was sure to come, and it did, thank God I was wise to push my funds into Muse finance Lockdrop and was not having anymore funds to buy SOL with.
Given, that that Solana experienced a complete shut down of their mainnet, I think it raised questions among a lot of people regarding their long-term potential. That is why I have shifted from Solana to Velas which appears to be its enhanced and glorified long-term substitute.
Any network with these high TPS suffer hardcore spam attacks. That’s the trade off of securing and decentralization.

Anyone can make a high TPS centralized network with a copy paste. But what keeps it safe, and without the fees, how can a network be protected and stay decentralized? 

This is why Ethereum will dominate.
This is a disaster.
Do they claim to be decentralized?

I don't understand the technology side, but I find the whole issue troubling from an investment point of view.  I don't hold any SOL and was considering buying it a few days back, but ultimately decided at the current price it was too expensive and I took into consideration the replies on my other post about Sol I made a few days back. 

At this point I won't buy in.  I will wait and see what happens but I just don't feel good about it at the moment.
There was no choice but to shutdown, bc of 300k/tps ""mempool"".  It was shutdown for software update.

It is for sure a problem that SOL had a shutdown problem, but even if it were as decentralized as bitcoin, consensus would still have been to shut down.
If decentralized projects experienced a similar attack, how would they deal with it (Since they can't shut down mainnet unilaterally)
The real question is: is this something other L1’s could do as well? Cardano, Ethereum, Polkadot, etc…?
[deleted]
Idk where all this shut down stuff came from.  
From the explanations that I read, the network crashed and all validators and nodes had to update their software and start em up again.  
Having the chain crash isn't the same as then shutting it down on purpose but it does show that Solana is still in beta and still needs to be battle tested
I guess Bitcoin Maxis are starting to make sense
I saw that the issue came from nodes that only had 128gb of RAM.

Crazy that even such a massive amount of RAM isn't enough to run a node at peak demand, maybe they'll bump requirements up to 256gb.
[deleted]
Unbelievable that even this sub is this clueless of what actually happened here.
The last sentence was said about Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past. These hiccups are what kept me from putting skin in the game. I feel like you can cut the head off but the bitch just keeps re-growing it back. Who know if this will be a fatal blow to SOL but it’s heavily VC and founder influenced. We’ll just have to see.
I do not understand why people keep repeating this silly argument about a costly node. As it looks now the future of crypto is not  in vast networks of individuals, operating nodes on raspberry pis. I realize that this is how it all started but I repeat this is not the future.

 Crypto projects will be building decentralized but semi-proffesionalized networks of reliable validators. The cost of some 128GB RAM server is really not important at all, as the main investment the validator will have to do is a certain large amount of stake. Just look at Eth 2.0., look at chains built in Cosmos ecosystem etc. 

There is a finite number of validator buckets in most blockchain projects, and I assure you that policies will be created to pick validators that are serious about it.
I think you make several excellent points.  I don't know if SOL's days are numbered but I would be surprised if the price of SOL can continue being so high after this.  I'm surprised it hasn't plummeted.  

I don't understand the technology side of Crypto, but I always thought that it all was more a less decentralized.  I was pretty shocked to read that SOL was literally shutdown.  I didn't think it was possible unless it was something like a 51% attack (idk if I am understanding that correctly either!). 

It will be interesting to see what happens over the next day or so with SOL.
30% or more of Ethereum nodes are on AWS. 60% are hosted on some cloud-provider. 

How do you define decentralization?

At this point maybe you should just own bitcoin
And zero POS assets.

In reality every POS asset is sitting on google, msft, amazon. Lets face reality sweetheart

Whats an IDO? Initial dao offer?
It sounds bad.  I am surprised the price of SOL didn't drop a lot further...which is what I would have expected but I guess it now depends on how quickly they fix it.  

I didn't know Filecoin had been hacked.  

Thanks.
SOL is really SUS right now. If SOL is really centralized, I expect a huge freaking dump.
People keep saying eth has also done a hard form before, is it less worrying that Sol’s shut down + hard fork?

https://solana.com
How much does it cost to run a spam attack like that? Spam attacks have always been an issue since the very early days of bitcoin as no-one needs permission to send a transaction on a permission-less decentralized payment network. It's a balancing act to make it as easy as possible for regular users whilst making the cost not worth it for spammers.

I don't know anything about an 'Oracle db license' (I did google what it is) but would that in itself cause this problem on the mainnet?

When you mention spam...would this be the same issue that Nano had?  As I've read they have had a spam issue in the past.  

Thanks.
I read somewhere it was a complete shutdown. I wonder why they didnt stagger the shutdown to preserve uptime. For whatever fix they needed they could have slowly pushed it onto the chain and let it trickle down to the other nodes? Somethings seems off.
If anyone or any action that relates to a network shutting down, that’s a big NO for me

Agreed. Not trying to bash SOL but, if you don't need consensus to make big decisions like that, then I'm not interested.
Yeah but that is the key difference, right? Consensus.

The outcome in *this* case would have been the same, but it's the means to the end that devalue SOL here.

A timely consensus vote to pause the network, patch a bug, and restart would have increased my perceived value of the network. 

A single entity going ""whoopsie"" and taking the whole thing offline emergently demonstrated no consensus is needed for big decisions.
Bitcoin network forks and continues as miners switch their node software together.. sol network was taken down by the single entity that controls it.
Ethereum is way too distributed to be shut down that way, as evidenced by the fact that miners revolting was a very real threat to the PoS switch. I can't say for the others.
[deleted]
PoW networks like Bitcoin, ethereum, and ergo are not susceptible to this. 

Cardano, polkadot, maybe.
Transactions on a centralized exchange don't use native blockchain until you withdraw. Everything is tracked on internal ledgers.
It's either that or fix whatever issue cause the 128gb nodes to fail. 

Since they already requite an ultra high spec machine to run a node, I expect they're now just going to require an ultra-ultra high spec machine.
On the validator page it strong recommends 256 minimum, but 128 can work. Was looking into building a validator. Have the SOL and the hardware.
I think they could implement some kind of pruning function where they move old data to some kind of (centralized?) archive.
Yes exactly. It took my be surprise as well. I came here expecting some deep dive discussions only to see that people are actually surprisingly clueless. Just look at the top comment.
this, 1000%.

&#x200B;

Oh, you need 5000$ hardware (which gets cheaper and cheaper over the years) to secure a 1 trillion dollar network? How awful, lol.

&#x200B;

And people say this with a straight face while we have asic miners that easily cost 10k per unit.
>  I was pretty shocked to read that SOL was literally shutdown.  

That isn't even true though. Why the fuck are you repeating bullshit?
The difference is anyone can spin up an ETH node, whereas a SOL node is crazy expensive and technical

My questions exactly. I like data too, share
Initial DEX offering. They were up on Raydium.
i would until the network starts working again,before making any statement about the price. people with solana that's not on an exchange had no chance to sell yet
A centralized coin getting dumped?
This is the first time i've read about it being in the beta phase.
Yes it was known and a lot of people called out this being a big issue with SOL before it happened.
It's a joke. Oracle DB is a database software - and, notably, *centralized*. A cryptocurrency controlled by one entity defeats the entire purpose of the technology, and so it may as well just be a normal database.
It was a joke based on recent fud.  It implied that they use an oracle database not a distributed blockchain.
The difference is the Nano network remained fully operational, although at a lower bandwidth, throughout the weeks long spam attack. Some tx were also delayed due to being out of sync, but it essentially recovered without being shut down completely.
I believe the nodes flooded and halted themselves, nobody shutdown anything. Or maybe they did, who the fuxk knows now
Availability/uptime was already 0% due to the issue, so there'd be no reason to stagger the rollout to preserve uptime. Just have everyone shutdown, apply the patch, and resume operations as quickly as possible. (And try not to let it happen again).
> The first thing you need to do before investment is to NOT look at the price. You need to look at market cap

Market cap is synonymous with price
Disagree.

If the tokens price went up 100x in the last months it's probably not a good idea to buy it now.
That's not at all what is going on. Why don't you research this and stop spreading misinformation
Gavin Wood tweeted this: ""Events of today in crypto just go to show that genuine decentralisation and well-designed security make a far more valuable proposition than some big tps numbers coming from an exclusive and closed set of servers. If you can't run a full-node yourself then it's just another bank.""

So i wonder if he thinks Polkadot is different in that it currently couldn't be shut down, or that it will become so once the auctions are done and everything is live.
The whole reason gas fees exist is to prevent ddos
Hm…so you’re implying that only a PoS network is subject to this? Do you think all PoS are doomed then or do you think there are any redeeming qualities of PoS?
is that why people can't sell SOL since it's down?
Why would anyone want to run such a validator without being paid for it? Even if you already have the hardware, did you plan on voting (1.1 sol/pay)?

I don't see any reason to warrant the costs, unless you have either a huge amount invested or are developing a big(!) project on top of it.
wouldn't pruning also be possible if data simply gets split up? every node would have only 1/x parts of the data actually available and the rest of the nodes only save checksums of the data they don't have, then they could verify/query the data of other nodes.
of course x would heavily depend on the amount of nodes, so having high requirements certainly doesn't help
No need to get your knickers in a twist.  

The whole reason I came and asked in this sub, was to try and get more reliable facts/opinions as there are so many conflicting stories?   

Exactly, how am I supposed to know it's bs?
Sorry how does it became SOL problem that you spin up crazy expensive nodes, is like blaming BTC for the hash rate because you can't afford latest mining machine.
It costs $400 for a threadripper CPU . $600 for 128gb RAM $120 for gen4 SSD. + case, board, power supply.

1.0 SOL per day validator fee is probably the only real barrier for entry

I truly believe you dont look up any of this. Like its impossible or something.
Thx!
Solana also has a two day wait for unstaking, so anyone who were staking needs to wait two days before they can sell.
The VCs that control SOL won't dump their coins just yet, that's like saying Elon Musk is dumping his Tesla shares because Tesla had a bad day.
Lol and I was taking your reply very seriously...googling all about it.  I was thinking this doesn't make any sense to me!
Thanks.  I did wonder if it was the same thing.
I mean you are completely splitting hairs here.

Like, would you rather have a nano kind of downtime, where your transactions are pending for 2 weeks, or the solana kind of downtime where you have to wait a day for your transaction to go through?
[deleted]
More like 9x but your point is still valid imo.
Tell us what's going on then.

Why comment about spreading misinformation without including... Information?
There are redeeming qualities of pos. They are faster and more scalable. These are at the expense of security and decentralization
If its on an exchange you can sell. If SOL is down then you can't move SOL to an exchange to sell.
I mean I kinda didn’t expect it to be at $200 each because I didn’t buy anywhere near $200. I figured I could afford it for a year easily regardless of numbers. Hardware is easy to get. Only a few hundred sol validators due to the high entry. Less than 1,000 people doing it. That exclusivity could easily get me better access and opportunities.

Check this out it’ll learn you a lot more than my comment. 

https://youtu.be/vRzQK1YzAQI
Yep. I think the technical term for what you're describing is 'sharding.' Eth is working on that now and I think Zilliqa already has it in place.
Solana has their own Twitter feed.  There's even a Solana subreddit. You read one person on reddit and that was it for you, you just repeat it now. Come tf on
I can run a BTC fullnode on a $40 raspberry pi computer
A threadripper is like $2k, please let me know where they are $400 lol 

Note you also need sufficient GPU power as well. It refuses to run on my high spec machine

Threadripper 3970x + 128GB DDR4 RAM + 2x AMD 5700 XT + 24TB SSD
You are forgiven - especially since googling Oracles and Blockchains won't find you the answer to the joke, and likely lead you down the rabbit hole of Oracles and blockchains that have nothing to do with the Oracle database.
I don’t think it’s splitting hairs. Solana’s blockchain shutting down requires people to trust that it will be up again. Sort of like trusting that the bank that holds your money will open the next day. Isn’t being trustless a core tenet of crypto?
DDOSing networks isnt something new. Many modern networks have mechanisms to monitor on-the-net and prevent this. The fact that Solana went down when bots flooded the network hints that there are bigger concerns with the its network design, security and scalability all together.
 https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1437856638279487493

The network suffered essentially a denial of service attack. The developers didn't shut the network down. This was a bug found WEEKS ago.  That's why the software update is available.  There's an update being rolled out and the validators are coordinating that but at NO POINT was there some team of devs or anyone out there able to hit a button and shut the network down.
Ok, so with all that being said, what is your opinion of PoS for a long term solution?
Cardano's PoS implementation has the same security as Bitcoin under the same network conditions, at least, according to their research.
Since you're still on this topic are you even reading the replies to your incorrect messages about consensus? It wasn't shutdown by a single entity, the network got stuck bc bots spamming 400k TPS.Then they fixed it and had to wait for the around 1100 nodes to update to the patched version., which is why it took such a long time.
Bad day at work?

Now see you're assuming things when you state I read 'one person' on reddit.  Maybe you haven't been in r/cc today that idk...but there's lots of fud on Solana there today. 

You literally attack me for saying 'I was shocked to read that SOL was literally shutdown' which is a fact...I was shocked at that.  That was my reaction...is my reaction fud or is what I read fud?   Am I to blame for the fud that I read?

I don't like fud...but I literally posted in here to get facts to filter out fud and you get all angry at someone at least trying to do the right thing. 

As for twitter...yeah, everyone is super honest and transparent on there.  

Where am I repeating this fud?  

Idk...maybe you work for Solana or maybe you have a big bag and are worried the price may go down.  

Anyway, I hope tomorrow is a better day for you.
Yes, you can store tx history ONLY as storage machine, but NO mining (meaning no reward or income).

I crypto these days you must invest to earn.
I meant to say $600. I see them open box for 6-650

The hardware is easy. The only barrier is daily fee.
Yeah, and you are trusting all the Bitcoin nodes and miners to keep running too.
Agreed. Seems some posters here pin point the issue the msg priority flow and that they are in The process of updating the node/validators. Craziness. Make me think of EOS and their spam issue early days.
I mean yeah, it's brand new. It took years before nano got spam resistance so I would assume a brand new player would have spam vulnerabilities out of the gate.

But yeah I also wouldn't buy any yet either.

Hopefully they get it all solved
People get annoyed with fee markets, but an obvious advantage of the main/older cryptos is that they are resilient to spam.  Btc has a big advantage over ETH in that ETH can have cryptokitty spam that is only subjectively malicious or not malicious.
Yep, thank you. People act like the devs have full control of the validators. They do not, so they can't just ""shut them down"".

They advised the validators to apply a fix and coordinate together and they agreed. But if the validators really wanted to, they could have disobeyed and stayed running with the old software (though they wouldn't be very useful to the network without the fix).
A long term solution to PoW? I think that it doesn't actually do the things PoW does well, so rather than being a viable alternative, it's a different thing entirely. 

pos is fine for quick transactions and high throughput. You can kind of scale it however you like.. 

Pow is actually slow and scales poorly on purpose. Its a necessary evil to have fair decentralized network validation that has thus far not been hacked after more than 10 years to my knowledge. I think if you wanted to take advantage of crypto technology correctly, you'd do what ergo is doing. Take everything Bitcoin got right and improve upon it (extended UTXO), then build layer 2 solutions where necessary to take over when PoW is too slow or doesn't have enough space for transaction data. 

A pow blockchain is basically a single state machine. Think computer processor that does one thing at a time linearly. No multi-core, no async processes. Sharding is one way to improve upon that, which eth is doing.. but why bother if youre going to pos anyway? We can all just keep using our banks and have fast transactions that way. 

Ergo encountered an issue where the single start nature didn't allow the dex to work. Basically if you queued a transaction, it would just have to wait in line before all other queued transactions. It didn't work at scale. So they created an off-chain decentralized bot system. Validators can run bots that submit blocks of transactions and are paid in tokens to do the service, then the layer 1 network confirms all the work after its been passed around to various other validators and is all checked. Then all the transactions are entered into the network as part of a single block. 

Keep an eye on that project. All the buzz words you see on algo and dot and sol and eth2.0 and nano, they're all being created on ergo but not hyped up.
Ignore that dude, you're doing nothing wrong here and this thread has been really useful.
i can run an ETH beacon chain POS node on a $40 raspberry pi
Maybe the 2000 series but I think theyre insufficient. I believe zen3 (3000s) are what’s needed
I feel like a project with so much ico money should have better security audits. Not ordering messages by importance, especially on such hardware, or even allowing that spam messaging, should be noticed very early. It's obviously a very rushed protocol.

I personally wouldn't trust them with an expensive product for next few years, but it's probably not a big deal for speculative crypto investors or subsidized partnerships.
[deleted]
I really, really appreciate your insights! Also thank you so much for the tip on ERGO, I will certainly be looking into them. Super refreshing to see a PoW solution amongst a sea of hype for PoS. I personally do not like PoS for L1 chains. It just doesn’t make sense and feels like a centralized L1 is inevitable. I’m ok with more centralized L2 solutions but L1 needs to be decentralized or this was all for nothing. Curious what your thoughts are on ETH moving to PoS? Do you hold any PoS coins or are you a PoW-only person? I have ergo on my list now. I am looking into some other PoW L1s as well.

Also: I’ve come across these interesting arbitrary DAG protocols like IOTA in my research. They claim to be scalable, decentralized, and secure without the need for miners and this allows very low transaction fees. IOTA specifically uses what they call a “tangle.” Would love to hear your thoughts on this if you have any insights on L1s that aren’t even really blockchains at all.
Glad to see others liking Ergo. I discovered them when I was trying to get in early on a cardano DEX and was doing a comparison of ergodex and the other early competitors. Everything about them seems way better than the other dexs at this point.
Maybe you should check out Kadena and reiterate your thoughts on PoW scalability.
Doesn't sequencer make Ergo's dex solution centralised?
I think it's been an extremely useful and informative thread too.  It's great to get everyones opinions. 

Thanks!
ETH can run on $40 Raspberry Pi while single lowest transection cost is nearly $20.

Solana took a different direction on PoH, then push the cost to validators by demanding a highend machine to achieve speed and lower transaction cost not without issues as well.

This idea of every crypto network MUST lower it's node requirements to Raspberry Pi is troubling, I'm basically seeing Myspace vs Facebook situation here between ETH vs SOL.

Time will tell, if Raspberry Pi node standard will rule the day but at the end developers will decide, end users will follow and case closed.
Zen3 is mentioned specifically in the hardware specs.
I have yet to see any correlation at all between protocol/code quality and funding.

But yeah I'm not going to trust anyone in this space either way. I don't speculate on products that aren't fully functional by my definitions
That's exactly right. A lot of hard forks actually happened yesterday too until the validators decided to coordinate and sync up in accordance with the Solana's dev team's advice.

The main fork is just whatever 51+% of the validators choose to do. So when most of the validators decided to halt to apply the fix, then the main fork was halted (which is very different from ""dev team shut it down"").

Also, just because validators are deciding to ""coordinate"" doesn't make it centralized. BTC and ETH nodes must coordinate all the time to decide on software updates. Sometimes they disagree and a hard fork is a created (e.g. BCH, ETC).
Love seeing people actually taking the time to look into this stuff. I agree, if you do away with decentralization it's all for naught. 

I hold cardano, so I'm not completely opposed to PoS, but I'm more pro-ada because they do a ton of research and have a great community. The tech they build will be useful to other currencies as well. I had dot but I recently traded it for kDa. Its a PoW chain that works for Asics, and some Chinese miners are moving off BTC to kda. Not sure if there's anything special about it besides some hype but I didn't get much. 

I read a bit on iota and wasn't sure I believed the buzz. It sounds like a lot of talk with no substance but I didn't give it a fair chance because it sounded stupid to me. I looked into nano more and it seems really dumb, and I think iota is a bit similar? 

Doesn't mean they won't make you money though ;)
You should check out CKB. Has layer 1 and layer 2 built in. POW, with scalability tools. Built from the ground up to resolve choices between POW and POS.
Doesn't Kadena use a type of network sharding?
They found a way to let the off-chain bots be run by anyone, in a decentralized way, paid in erg.
yes the ethereum network is currently at capacity, thank you for pointing that out. the whole reason for the major upgrade is to address this problem, among others.

> This idea of every crypto network MUST lower it's node requirements to Raspberry Pi is troubling

this isn't an idea that's pushed among every project or community, its just to demonstrate just how decentralized a network of validators can be at the extreme end.

> I'm basically seeing Myspace vs Facebook situation here between ETH vs SOL.

this would make sense if ethereum were somehow opposed to upgrading technologies or capabilities, but would seem like a disingenuous way to frame it if were not opposed to innovation.
What sounds stupid about Iota and Nano? maybe I can help you out.
Appreciate your input. KDA is another one on my list. They are claiming to have scaled PoW with their “chain web” protocol. I need to look more into the security of this protocol but it looks so so promising. I think they could be a good one too in the future. It’s just getting so much more complicated now with having to think about not only different blockchains, but now they are coming out with structures that aren’t even blockchains! It’s crazy but so so awesome! Bitcoin will always win, but having another coin or coins to bet on would be good. 

I also agree with your sentiment on Nano and I believe it is also similar to IOTA but I haven’t looked very deeply into Nano yet. More food for research!
Awesome, I’ll look into them. Thanks a bunch!
They use graph theory to create a sharded network of chains that can be scaled unlimited. Currently they are running on 20 chains.
I see. That's interesting. Will look into it. Thanks.
No thank you. I'm staying away from those projects.
Nano, is great, but it is just a currency. Other than being DAGs iota and Nano are not all that similar. Iota has a number of features that nano doesn't have, one of the big ones is zero value transactions.  There is a huge amount of Iota info available online and they have projects with companies like Zebra (world's largest manufacturer of barcodes scanners), STMicroelecteonics (Europe's largest chip manufacturer), Dell, Intel, ARM, IBM, Linux Foundation on project Alvarium and a number of others.      

One important distinction between Nano and Iota vs other currencies. They don't just have low transaction fees. They have zero transaction fees.  
If Iota gets everything working without the coordinator (data transactions are already off it, testnet has been running without it for awhile now), it will have the best tech in the crypto space.
I had wrote a few long replies and forget to bring up sharding in this last one. Fingers crossed kda continues to prove it has a robust solution.
That's a shame. Love seeing people actually taking the time to look into this stuff.
Thank you, I appreciate your insight on this matter. I will admit to being not all that knowledgeable on IOTA or Nano. I was merely trying to compare the two based on their DAG qualities. My intentions are to find the best L1 solutions around that will last long into the future. The kind of L1 where I can buy the coin, comfortable knowing it will be around in decades time and not worthless. I believe most PoS coins will not stand the rest of time once people realize the end game for those coins. It’s all about the end game and then working backwards for me.
Yep, I hope so too but at the moment I think it is one of the most promising under the radar projects.
I looked into them enough that they came across as scams and I'm not interested in looking further.
How do they come across as scams? IOTA has over 90 employees, and Dell, IBM, Linux Foundation, Intel, Jaguar, Land Rover, Zebra, STMicroelectronics, German government, EU (ESBI Infrastructure, IOTA hasn't won the rights to the project yet but they are currently in first place for the contest) are working with them, among a number of others.       

None of them have figured out the scam, you should shed some light on it.     


 You don't have to take IOTA's word for it, all these organizations have their own press releases about their projects with IOTA.

Edit - Changed number of employees, can't remember where I read 150, website has information on 92 current employees so I'll go with that number instead.
This is exactly how they're scams. They launched as crypto currencies, how do they have deals with all these companies?

If I want to invest in corporations, Ill do it with stocks. If I want to hold a crypto asset, it better be decentralized. 

Every time I talk about them people list the companies they do business with as credibility signals. You shouldn't have to name drop to prove credibility, you should just be doing things that make you credible!
Because companies are working with them they're scams?     

IOTA data transactions are decentralized, IOTA value transactions have been decentralized on the test net for months, once they're finished testing it will be completely decentralized and I don't know of any crypto that it will be cheaper to run a node for. 

IOTA is not a corporation, it is a non profit organization, which in Germany has a huge list of rules they need to follow, including 0 funding for advertising. That is a credibility signal.  

These projects are part of what makes them credible, they aren't just ""partnerships"" that look good on paper. Project Alvarium (Dell, Intel, IBM, Linux Foundation and IOTA) are working together to secure edge data, if that doesn't give credibility to the project I don't know what does. I think this is one of the coolest projects in all of crypto, that's why I name drop it. https://www.cio.com/article/3617917/project-alvarium-and-the-rise-of-data-confidence.html      

PDF directly from Dell: https://education.dellemc.com/content/dam/dell-emc/documents/en-us/2020KS_Todd_Project_Alvarium-The_Future_of_Edge_Data.pdf

I can run a node for the cost of a raspberry pi. All the IOTA that they control was given to them by the community, they took 0 iota for themselves at the start of the project. If these things don't add credibility, what does?     

So tell me, what aren't they doing to add credibility?  You can use a large number of the features on the decentralized test net right now.  There is public access to the test net, no need to take anyone's word for it.   

I don't see anything that other ""credible"" projects are doing that IOTA isn't also doing.  What is the goalpost you want them to meet here?     

You can say ""it has no fees and that scares me"", or ""it isn't fully decentralized on the mainnet yet,"" or ""it doesn't have staking so I don't like it."" That is fine and reasonable. Saying it is a scam, particularly because they are working on projects with huge corporations and governments is just silly. I've never heard of something being called a scam before because they are working with companies on projects.",,,,,,

Even though you had a big loss, you likely have learned a lot on the rise up and on the fall. I know it hurts, but try to refocus and see it as paying for the education in trading. Take what you have now and begin again with what you have learned. You have a lot of years for it to grow. You will go through more ups and downs. Don't tie your self worth to money. I've had money and I've been broke. Money doesn't change who you are. It's only a tool.
I started in Feb with 8k, got it up to $32k, then back down to $2k. At $4k now. Chin up, you’re still in the game!
you’re still in the game, what you’ll pull from the markets over the next fifty years will far surpass this loss
It always feels great when you're on a good streak and it sucks when you're on a bad one. 

Just remember that's exactly what the market is. It's up and down but most importantly it's not over. 

There's tons of people who take $2.6k and blow right through that $52k point you were at in no time. It can literally turn around in the blink of an eye with one great trade. 

Pick yourself up. Dust off. Do your needed DD on the next trade and carry on.
I also want to tell you something about depression. My husband committed suicide in May. We fought constantly and about money up until the night he did it. To this day, money doesn’t have the same meaning to me. I need it but I don’t see the same value. Your family would feel the same if you did anything to harm yourself. Please remember that material shit can always be dealt with. Get help if you need it and talk it out.
I'm 25 and am literally in the exact same situation you're in right now. Nothing really compares to losing a relatively incomprehensible amount of money in such a short time. Many people say it's ""just money"", but for me, and probably for you as well, it's much more when you think of the bills and debt that could have been paid with it.

Learn. You absolutely have to learn, teach yourself relentlessly. I'm tell you, the only way you'll make it back is if you learn how to trade and/or invest. I'm not there yet and haven't made much back but I'm on my way. I've spent the past 2 months dumping ALL of my time into learning technical and fundamental analysis, and I'll be honest, I don't have confidence in my trading yet but the knowledge has given me hope. The hope is the only thing keeping me going. That, and a lot of support from my friends and family. I only tell them what I want them to know (they DON'T know how much I blew lol), but generalize mostly that I'm struggling and it's hard, but that I have a plan. I know it'll take a while to really get good, but after what I've learned, I can see myself being profitable in the future.

You need risk management above all else. Preservation of capital is the only thing that will save you, you're in this game to survive above all else. This includes both stop orders and exposure limitations, as well as diversification of what you're trading. The money will come, but you have to set realistic expectations and understand it may take a few years. Trade small and don't allow yourself to blow up again. 

You need a strategy to tell you what setups to trade. You should use fundamental analysis to establish a bias (long or short). You need technical analysis to understand when to enter and exit a trade. Having a mentor helps, I haven't had much of that aspect yet but I've heard it's essential.

Choosing the right market is also important. I wanted to trade stocks, but having a cash account makes it hard with settlement periods. Having a margin account is great but I can't afford to tie up 25k due to PDT, and to potentially lose it all again if I fuck up. I'm looking into forex right now, because you can still trade price action with any acount size and integrate a little news into your strategies.

DM me if you want a little extra help. I'm struggling myself but I really truly believe it's possible to make that money back and eventually turn this into a career of financial independence based on the idea of being consistently profitable. I found out that for every person who YOLO'd their second mortgage on GME calls, there's a thousand people with loss porn they're too embarrassed to share.

Thanks for sharing the pain man, don’t hide it but share it with those who you trust around you, burden in life is meant to be carried with those around us.

The closest thing I’m working on right now is my daily workout routine in the mornings. Often times I miss it and feels like the whole day is out of wack or just a giant sunk cost. But this morning, I realized that it’s in these moments that I am given the opportunity to pick myself back up by focusing on the next item on my agenda for the day to go tackle it. 

One step at a time brother, I’m with ya.
Build it back up with 2k. You just paid for a 35k worth of training, and you have not failed yet.
First thing first, consider your loss as a price for a hard learned lesson, an expensive one. You know now, how important risk&money management and having a well made plan and stick to it until you out of the trade which is discipline. 

You are so young and this is actually a big experience for your age. Give a break from trading and focus on stuffs you enjoy to do. And come back to trading floor like a real warrior.

**Dont forget there is always tomorrow :)**
You’re young take that 2.6k and shove it into a promising stock and forget about it build your $ back up and stay focused.
I just recently started to dive into the markets myself so not any type of financial advice but I will tell you this. Out of all the reading I have done and all of the podcasts they all agree on one thing “takes the losses while your still young”. These are learning experiences for the older you get. Learn to set small goals and put in your stop losses and take profits. A lot of people want to ride it as far up as it will go. Problem with that is no one can predict the peak (not saying you did this). 37k at your age is amazing! 2.6k is a lot more than most have at that age. Keep your head up and play around with some paper trading to build up your confidence again. While you are watching your paper account you can begin building up your account to jump back in. Good luck!
I tried real estate and the second house I lost $100k, which was 50% of my money. I was depressed too, but I wasn’t going to give up, just change my strategy. Then I found stocks, and I’ve made 200k this year alone. You’ll find what you’re good at and make that money back and then some!
I wanted to kill myself too after I crashed my account, 60k, but we are worth more than that as humans. You’re a decade younger than I was also; so plenty of time to recover and move on. It’s just money bro.
Im sorry you had to learn such an expensive lesson; i lost 10% today, it sucks. The good news is you are only 22. You can bounce back but its going to take a decent amount of time. Work on risk management and recognizing emotional tilt in the future
Take a step back. You've learned some hard lessons, but being able to respect the market is a beautiful thing that you now have. Take some time to yourself away from the charts. Wait for this bear cycle to start, and even let it develop for a few months. You'll know when/if you're ready to come back. 

Always remember, time in the market is more important than timing the market. Don't over risk yourself when you come back, and live to trade another day. If you want to stick with this, it will be the greatest reward you can imagine, so don't forget why you started. Best of luck to you!
35K is a big hit but you are only 22. You’ll make that back in no time in your lifetime don’t worry soo much. I’m almost double you age and am down 100K. I don’t have as much timeframe as you do to get it back but at the end of the day it’s just money.
Realize that there is nothing you can do that will change your past mistakes. Really internalize the fact that everything in life is temporary. The losses you incurred and your feelings associated are temporary. Regret is pointless unless you learn from your mistakes so don’t beat yourself up too hard and try to learn from it. 

Also, you are 22. This is the perfect time to fuck up like this. I missed out on +100k gains at 23 in the crypto cycle before and it ate away at me for too long without learning from it. Don’t make the same mistake as I did and move on from it sooner rather than later.
That sucks, no two ways about it. The good news is that you are young. Having 37k to invest at 22yo is amazing in and of itself. If you managed to make that happen then I am sure you will learn lessons from this time and apply them moving forward. I know that ""it's just money"" is a bullshit thing to say, but there are bigger things. If you were 50 it would be a different story, but at 22 you can turn this ship around real fast.
The good news is you're young and you'll recover. If you did this at a later stage in your life, you'd not only be broke but also getting a divorce! You're one of the few 22yos that know what it's like to have made 52k. You can do it again.
I’m in the exact same boat. Every day I try to find something that will pull me back up and it winds up making it worse. People post here gains daily yet I cannot make one dollar - literally $1. I have no advice other than to say you’re not the only one, you’re young, and things will all shake out fine. Just trust that because it’s true.
Obviously this feels awful, but this is probably the best time in your life to get this lesson. You’re young and have plenty of time to rebuild and recoup these losses! You got a hard lesson out of the way and now the rest of your trading will be better off for it. Sending love 💕
Everything is always temporary
Get back to the books and study hard
Find a process that works for you
Find an edge and exploit it until it fails

So stop crying
How does a 22 (or 21) year old get $37K in the first place?
[deleted]
I'm 26 and I'm starting now with 10k (€), at 22 I was a poor student and no more.. I wish I had 2k :) you've still got quite some cash, even if it certainly hurts.. you'll come back stronger 💪🏻
I support you and I have faith in your success in the long run
You need those big hit if you want to continue as a trader. Lost more 100K in the last 2 months. I know im a good trader but i got hit and my risk management was clearly not efficient in that kind of market. Stay safe. At least you dont owe that money to the bank
hold Onto your stocks as long as you don’t sell them and they’re in your portfolio they can appreciate with time this dip is just a small blip on the greater ride that is wealth... Hang in there and leave your profile alone for a while and don’t look at it -so depressing
Take some time off, and start small. Risking only $10 per trade until you can do that consistently for at least 1-3 months, then scale up in risk. I'm doing this and my account is around 2.5k right now. Consistency first, size comes much much later.

You got suckered in with the get rich mentality,  you're young, impatient and you started out with way too much money. Everyone pays their tuition to the market, that's why you should start small because you'll lose a big chunk of it anyway.

On the plus side, if you can muster up 37k at 22 yo there's no man overboard. Just trade with low risk for a few months and in the meantime save up money to boost the account further down the road.
22 with 37k to burn in stocks? Not in school? Say that 35k lost was for your ""education"" and learn your lessons from losing it all I'd say.  Try and see what worked at the start and try that.  But you said it was emotions that seemed to cost you, so until you get a plan and can put them into check it's going to be a rough ride.
>I just want your advice how to get through this mentally.

Alcohol, cocaine, and sex with random strangers you meet at bars...maybe spend a few months fucking a crazy chick.
Hey there. I've done the exact same thing as you. $50k down to 0 actually.  In fact it happened to me not that long ago. I'm 27 and not made of money.

The first few days were tough. I think I was running a low-grade fever for 3-4 days after. No appetite. Constant heart pumping when I thought about what happened. Trying to hide my emotions from the people in my life.

It took me a while to get rid of that pit of anxiety in my stomach. Don't be afraid to cry and release it all. Don't hold that shit in.

First things first you need to take care of your physical health. Try your best to get good sleeps, drink enough water and don't starve yourself. Don't let one financial event cause harm in other areas of your life.

Eventually you need to come to terms with what happened and try to get your confidence back. You turned $37k into $52k in a matter of months. Not everyone can do that. Usually when you attain a certain level of money once, it becomes easier to attain it again. You just have to figure out a plan and put in the work.

It also helped me to listen to succesful people who made millions, lost it all, dusted themselves off, regrouped, and then proceeded to make themselves a true fortune. They didn't give up and neither should you.

Jim Rohn has a great story on Youtube about this and James Altucher has an epic reddit post responding to someone who was in a similar situation to yourself.

I wish you good luck on your recovery and I look forward to your future post about how you rose from the ashes back to new highs.

I'm also going to copy paste a post I made to someone else before. It rings very true:

## Are you in at a low point in your life? To whoever needs to hear this

>Whatever it is.  
>  
>Whatever it is that put you in a rut.  
>  
>It could be financial devastation. It could be the loss of a loved one. It could be an excruciating breakup.  
>  
>Just remember, it could be worse.  
>  
>You could be homeless. You could have a debilitating disability. You could have a terminal illness.  
>  
>You could be dead.  
>  
>But you're not. You're still alive. You're still relatively healthy.  
>  
>So where do you go when you're at your low point? Most people would say ""the only way to go is up!"". That's simply not true. It can always get worse. Read above.  
>  
>You need to come to terms with what happened. Mourn it. Accept it. Put it into perspective.  
>  
>And then figure out your next move. Will you roll around in your own sorrow for the rest of your life? Will you whither away into nothing?  
>  
>Or will you use that event as a catalyst for the next chapter of your life? A springboard to move up and get to where you've always wanted to be.  
>  
>Your back is now against the wall. Just like your favorite heroic story. Or your favorite stock or crypto. It always has to drop first before it bounces to greener pastures.
Where in the FUCK did you get 37K at 22 godddamit I swear to god I’m gonna die poor fuc fuck fuck duck FUCK
That seems like a massive amount of money you've lost, and NGL it's a decent amount. 

!!!!!    HOWEVER    !!!!!

You are YOUNG! Some lessons are more expensive than others. This was a tough one. You'll climb back. At 22 you get a nice job and you'll build your savings in a hurry. It's really no sweat. 

Take every mistake as an opportunity to learn, and then MOVE ON! You only steal from your future by obsessing over a mistake and getting into a ""what if"" mentality. Play the game of life from the position you currently are at, not some hypothetical scenario that doesn't exist anymore. GL!
When I was 22 I was working at a holiday camp on 5£ an hour and had fuck all in the bank, 2k is 2k pal invest it in cocaine that market never fails
Went from 10k in December to 330k to 20k to 250k to 15k, all in about 3 months. I’m 22 and this post hit extremely close to home, also struggling with anger and depression due to. Very much appreciate reading over all the advise in the comments. Keep your head up man
Honestly you sound like you have a gambling problem. I would address that before going into any other risky endeavors.
Study risk management over and over and over. Building wealth takes time. With a 50k account you should be aiming to make 100-200 each day
Chin up, make small trades and slowing climb back up, try to aim for $100 or so a day in gains, not much but will add up over time 😎👍🏼
You might want to seek out resources for gambling addiction.
Oh man, hopefully the losses weren't in vain, and you learned a lot through that experience because you are super young and have 3-4x more life to grow. This could be that turning point where you sharpen your investing strategies and develop your risk management skills better. 

I don't know exactly what kind of investor/trader you are but one thing Andrew Aziz said that really hit home for me was something like,""Your broker's job is to place orders, your job is to manage risk"". 

Stuff like "" never risk more then 2%"" of your capital on a trade. 

EG. I have 5,000 and want to risk 2% , and the price of the stock is $5.00. 

I will purchase (5,000 x 0.02= $100 / (5 x 0.02 = 0.1)) = 1,000 shares purchased with a stop of 10 cents below entry.
You’re still very young and have plenty of time to learn from this and earn back the losses. If you were 50 and lost all your retirements savings it would be a different story ;)

Maybe take 30 days off. Write down a plan and stick to it.
Lesson Learned:  Keep your trades at 1-2% of your total account value.

I had calls on AAL, INTC, and AMAT that I put in yesterday at about their midpoint and was feeling good up until around 1:07pm today.  Took a 20% loss on all of them.  But since this was only 3% of my account, I only lost around 0.005% of my total account.

I'm annoyed, but certainly not on tilt over it and can easily recover.
Its not how hard you fall, but how high you bounce back.

Sounds cheesy, but you're still young and have plenty of opportunity to make that money back up and then some. If anything, you learned a hard (and expensive) lesson which will help you in the future.
Hey man 24yo here. Took an 11k account up to $29k this year then back down to $16k. Shit hurt real bad. The good news is, we’re still young and have learned a lot of lessons. The biggest takeaway I’ve had is to come up with a way to better manage risk. I’ve started getting better at knowing when I want to trade because of emotions. This is a super tricky market to be in for what it’s worth. In the grand scheme of your life though you’ve made way more than most 22 year olds and learned this lesson early on to make the most of it. Don’t give up, I can’t lessen the way you feel, but blaming yourself and reliving the loss over and over will only hurt you in the long run. Take some deep breaths, step away if you have to and in the future you’ll be back stronger than ever. Cheers friend!
Work hard and start over. There’s no getting it back, just getting back up! You lost earned it once, you’ll earn it again. YOU STILL HAVE SOME LEFT, hold onto it, work hard to build it back up. Take a break. Do a puzzle , read a book.... TALK TO SOMEBODY , preferably a professional. NO AMOUNT OF MONEY LOST is worth your life . Money is replaceable ...you are not!  YOU with only a penny in your pocket ARE enough!!!  I’m sorry you’re going through this. As a former gambling addict, who almost lost everything .... THERE IS LIGHT at the end of the hole.... best thing you can do is STOP DIGGING! you ARE enough ... money or no money, you will rebound and be stronger because of the LESSONS LEARNED. ((Hugs))
im 32 and ive lost about 15k day trading, im learning and probably wont be profitable for a long time.  Keep your head up mate, money comes and goes.

Dont stress about losing money please.  Pick yourself up, dust yourself off and think positive, you have lost money but you will get that money back.  Please do not beat yourself up about it.  Life is full of opportunities 

&#x200B;

God bless

All the best
You are only 22 years old... you have whole life ahead of you...This is just a lesson in the life.. learn it and move on ..
u still have 2.6k rt? learn from this and get back on your feet and trade/invest right. Look carefully, those are two different things: investing and trading are NOT the same thing. Only trade/invest in companies you 100% believe in and are in good financial standing so that if ur trades go sideways, you only need to hold. it'll hurt to see red but if you hold, you WILL recover. take this note for next time :)

&#x200B;

edit: oh also, I recommend putting the rest of your 2.6k in cyio and holding for 1 yr.
Actually..!  You should be grateful for a life lesson learned young and out of the way! 
You are so way ahead of 98% of other people.   
From this 1 small failure you have essentially diverted many others in your future.   
Speaking as someone who has daughters just older then you, “it’s okay”!
You’re young and supposed to make mistakes.  How else will you learn?  
If you don’t take chances you’ll never get anywhere other then where you already are....  
Take chances! Make mistakes, but learn from them!  That’s what life is all about! 
***Make a list of what you did wrong and why, and think about each one.  
Take that last 2,000 buy a long term stock and delete your app.   Go back and look at it next year.
Chin up, take a break, save up some more cash, keep staring at charts each and every day you can, then get back in the game. But key is to walk away right now... you're in no state to try to make any of it back. I'll share a spark note of my 13 year journey in hopes that it will give you some peace.

While trying to finish my last year of college at the age of 22, I lost $18k, started to hold a balance on my credit cards so I could fund my trading account. Got to the point where I couldn't pay for tuition and had to ask my brother for help. Grades were horrible one quarter and got dismissed the next quarter. Had to get good grades in the summer in order to be let back in to continue my degree. That was shit time... I was depressed as hell. My asperations of being a day trader had put my degree at risk and I was in debt. Was fortunate enough to get the financial help I needed from family and completed my degree. Took a long break from trading.

Didn't touch stocks for 4 more years, saved up a good amount and decided to try for paid courses. Spent 6k+ on different FURUs and went to trader conferences. I kept trying to trade small accounts... I can't even remember how many 5k accounts I blew up. Took money out of my IRA and 401k, loss both. Started to pay only the minimums on my credit cards again, and was basically living pay check to pay check. Racked up 200k in losses over a few years. Decided to take another long 3 year break away from trading to save up and clear my head.

I had lost all the money I earned since graduating. You can imagine how psychologically weak I was at this point. But what I did during those breaks was to always check in on the market and watch the price action of stocks every day. Something clicked in 2019... but I made back all my losses in 4 months, 2020 was the best year I've ever had, and 2021 has already surpassed that. I'm currently looking at a six figure week. Not flexing, just saying this ridiculous dream is achievable even after entering the depths of hell psychologically.

As many others have said, consider this your market tuition. Experience doesn't come for free. Yes, in this profession, you can do your best to control how much that tuition will be, but you can only do so with discipline and the right state of mind. So again my advice is, take a long break from trading, the market will always be there. There will always be opportunities. If you're serious about this, continue to stare at charts, L2, watch price action, DO NOT TRADE. Come back once you've got some good savings and get in slowly. It's possible. Feel free to PM if you'd like to chat. Good luck!
Just yolo the rest on a penny stock and maybe you’ll get
Lucky. Life moves on buddy and so will you. Stay strong
It this helps you in any way let me know. Last year my TD net liquidity was around 135k. I entered an option position on BA, VXRT, MRNA and all went south with BA being the biggest loss. In July of 2020 my account was down $3200.00. I took couple of weeks off from trading just went cold Turkey. Two or three weeks later I started smaller positions with sound TA bought long calls on NVAX, GTRS and OKTA. Jan 2021 my account balance shot up to 80K. In Feb again I made some bad calls by getting CCIV, CLOV and right now I am back around 50K point is never get depress and don’t try to hit home runs. Take one day at a time keep a very tight risk reward. Do paper trades first start using technical analysis and use charts. Nothing is impossible as long as you don’t make the same mistakes. Let me know if I can be of any help.
Best things I learned about trading were in a course called Trend Trading to Win. This was nearly 20 years ago. 

1) Nobody ever went broke taking profits. 

2) Don’t try to hit a home run. Just get on base. Guy with the best on base average ever hit a home run one day. In the post game interview he was asked what he did different. “I made a mistake” was his reply. 

3) Plan your trade and then trade your plan. 

My advice in this case would be to take a break. You’re “on tilt” as they say in the poker world. You took a hit and your risk profile went in the toilet trying to make up for it. 

You need to step back, honestly assess your mistakes and physically write them down. Post this piece of paper above your monitor (old school I know) where you trade and let it guide you to the good decisions you made while you were going up. 

If losing 35 grand teaches you how to never do that again, and you’re not heavily in debt as a result, it’s a relatively inexpensive lesson. 

A minimum wage job brings that amount in, in a year. A well paying job (for most people) can make that in 4 months. 

You’re young, savvy, (and not inexperienced anymore) and can get back on the horse after you have your break. 

Good luck to you!
I know everyone has already said this, but you are young and you'll be able to make this back in no time.  Almost everyone who trades has been in this position before.  I took my 20k account up to 41k then down to 3.5k by playing with options.  After stopping for a while and realizing options weren't for me, and I should stick with stocks life got better.  But I had to stop and re-examine what didn't work for me.  Just walk away from the trading for a minute to clear your head.  But that doesn't mean you're done trading.
Stop trading
22 with 37k? lol. did you save it or was it handed to you?
You’re 22. You made really dumb decisions. Sounds like you’re exactly where you should be. Take it on the chin, learn some lessons, pick yourself back up and at least build some resilience out of this.. If losing 25k is the worst thing that ever happens to you, you’re gonna have a good life.
Ok first sentence of first comment, he says you made really dumb decisions. Wow! Such insight.  The truth is, you didn't make decisions at all.  Run do not walk to youtube and find Rande Howell.  

Good luck, and do not jump of any bridges. You have plenty of good things ahead of you. I know it doesn't feel like it, but I've got 30 years on you Son.  Keep breathing.  I was in your shoes once a long time ago, so I am not bullshitting when I say, I know how you feel.

Listen to Uncle Rande.  Not affiliated in any way, but he is the guy you need to hear.

It's gonna work out.
May I ask how you had 37k available to trade at age 22? - Coming from a broke 30 year old.
[deleted]
The fact you’re only 22 and had $37k to play with in the first place tells me you’re in a damn good position, much better than your average pier.

You’re so young bro now is the time to take risks and learn as you have plenty of time to recover.

By the time you’re my age (mid 30s) I promise you’ll look back at this and laugh. Hard to see that while you’re in the middle of it but don’t beat yourself up so much. Mistakes are ok as long as you learn from them :)
Close your eyes and think about someone you consider to be successful. What name pops up? Bezos? Musk? Whomever. 

I guarantee that they lost more money that you did while they were learning.

You need to view mistakes as tuition - the price paid to learn. You know what you did, you paid your tuition. Even that feeling of no confidence is a lesson. 

Your next class is dealing with that confidence issue. 

You never stop learning. All you can do is try to lower the tuition you pay for the lessons.
Put the rest in crypto and HODL....after losing a similar amount in this market I am done with stocks.  Crypto has been my only saving grace through all of this.
It's gambling. That's all day trading is. Sorry for your loss
Buy some AMC with what you have left and HODL! You will recoup your losses, but hurry the Rocket ship is ready to leave.
This is why I only buy shares. 36k is plenty to trade big or medium caps (shares) practically risk free.
Biden is trying to raise capital gain tax in the mean time. Possibly to drag stock trading down more.
#1 Stop trading for the time being (I’m currently doing the same thing cause I was headed toward the same level of destruction for the second time) #2 take time to reflect and write down on all the mistakes you remember making, why you made them, how you went about it and how you can avoid it in the future (this includes taking notes of your emotional states) #3 Create a system that will help you avoid those mistake rather than relying on your sheer willpower. My philosophy is that I start from understanding that I am an irrational being bound to do irrational stuff in the market, thus creating a system that controls my irrationality so that even if I mess up, it won’t cause that much disaster. I don’t trust myself to behave so I put myself on a leash #4 go on WallStreetBets and brown through loss porns and memes on loss porns, trust me this will make you feel a little better as you’d see you aren’t alone but also will make you laugh. Sometimes you just need to laugh at your pain, people outside the world won’t understand this but the retards on WSB will. In fact, post your lost porn if you can, just to feel like you’ve gotten it out there and stop the guilt and shame 

#5 it may not feel like it but one day you will laugh and even brag about this. It will be a badge of achievement and reminder of how far you’ve been so take it easy, mourn if you have to but get back up and go back to battle
I would go buy amc with what's left, and join r/amcstock r/superstonks...people can hate on the ""meme stock"", but its actually not just a meme stock.. there is a lot going on there if you read all the DD. You would get it back soon.
Go get some coke and hookers with the 2.6k that will cheer u up
Not financial advice but buy some rocket ship tickets over at GME .. they go on sale at noontime
Unless you have an education in finance / economics, stay out of the market.  Buy index or mutual fund if you invest directly.  Or let a pro manage your money.
I’m taking Al Brooks trading course. It’s like 100 hours of video. He is not a scam he is the real deal. It’s boring as fuck but I am learning EVERYTHING and I am becoming a better trader every day. You can slowly rebuild, you can, but you need to just be super careful this time and take it baby steps at a time. In the video I watched tonight he said only risk the amount of money you wouldn’t think twice about losing. Maybe that’s $50 a day. For me it’s around $100 a day seems so low but I am building my account consistently and every day pretty much I am in the green. 
You can learn from this. You can come back from this but you just have to be super careful and manage your risk very seriously. Tiny little baby steps with good daily trades that have high probabilities. 
See this as a super super important learning lesson and wake up call. All will be well. You can come back from this. 
Seriously though. Al Brooks trading course. Learning the in and outs of price action. It’s amazing.
I was once up to $1500 then burned $500 from a principle of $1000 and went a drunken depression; came back to the market a few months later; dropped 2k earned 3k slowly scalping for. 2 months. Lost 1k in one move after not losing any trades for a months; I thought I was invincible so I kept holding. Anyways cut my loss at $1000 leaving me break even. This time around though; I had no remorse, no anger, no fear. I just laughed and revenged traded to loss another $100; then by chance my random doge coin bet from February paid off and I earned $1000 from it :) and now I’m back to where I was a week ago with 3k total value. I mean hey, I could have had 4K but I’ve learned so much lessons on the way that I’m not even mad, I’m comfortable by the way, I have 0 checkings 0savings and maxed credit cards; I litteraly trade with everything on the line.. my car needs a new transmission but if we keep trying we can get to the top!! Next I want to invest in a SEries 7
I'm sure you learned something from this, that's what's important. 
I'd say buy GME with your remaining money, let it sit and focus on your mental health with meditation and exercise.
Should have put it all in GME and left it alone lmao
Grab a couple shares of GameStop and you’ll be good  lol of course this is not financial advice.
Never let your emotions get involved that's for women.
If you can’t turn that 2k into 50k by years end... than you don’t need to be trading. Went from 1500 initial and sole investment to 16k in 5 months.
What did you have put money into? Options? Things can definitely be difficult but the stock market is very cyclical, if you have stocks they may come back around
Looks like you didnt do it through options, what tickers were you trading to lose this much?
22 is young!! You can overcome this!
It's happens buddy. Seriously,  take time away from trading. Like genuinely take a month or two where you are just reading and learning, then start paper trading and back testing a system, then get back in with your remaining bank. Take this as a learning opportunity. You only fail if you go to zero, or you quit.
Can’t really give you trading advice, but I can tell you one thing: keep your head up, maybe stay away from trading for one or two weeks to clear your head and start it again with a fresh mindset. Even if it sounds stupid, it’s just money.  Life is much more than just money.
Take a break, if you can.
It ain't over till you're balls deep in margin my friend, don't give up.
share it on Reddit man, upvotes will give you instant money
Maybe you should start slow, with smaller amounts of money. 50k for a 20yo is pretty much money. As many have said, you’re young and have plenty of time to comeback. Just learn from this and try to improve.
Maybe read some psyco-trading books, it helped out for me.
Do not be disappointed. They are fucking with all the stocks. You can't count on your graphs right now.  When the market corrects itself. Not sure how long that will take, things will get better.  Your only losing because you are playing their game.  Give yourself a break, sit back, breath and realize they are the problem right now, not you.
We are all with you, or  soon will be, with the announcement of possible 43% capitals gains tax.......
Wow I was 22 once and at that time I had about 20$ in my account so.
I lost 35k during the 2017 crypto craze. Was most of my money at the time. Still here and came back stronger than ever
You are not the money. I know it’s f shittt to lose. But money comes and goes. In these words is more truth than they can even describe. YOU ARE NOT THE MONEY! Keep that in mind. Life has more to give than this shit. If you keep on working on your mindset, it will easily come again.
this is a bad day man. get away from screens now, just go away, do other stuff, call your friends and familiy, cause looking at the screens wont bring anything back


when you feeling better, calmer, more at peace, come back for homework and try to figure out if you can grow from this.
As I am at the beginning / learning how to trade and wish to do trading for my living:
How did you trade, what was your strategy?
Sadly you started in a false market and then saw your first correction. The experience you've received from this week be worth more than you lost as long as you learn from your mistakes.
Toni Turner has a good book on Day Trading. Just take some time away from your monitor and read her book. It sounds like you already know where some of your problem areas came from. You need to give yourself a break. You are only 22 and you have years of trading ahead of you. Take a workshop to refresh and then try trading something different like options. You’re going to be ok. Just stop where you’re at and re- assess where you want to take things. Someday when you’re getting your grandkids set up with their Trading accounts you can tell them about the lessons you learned at age 22🌻
Taking large losses is hard and investing in risky investments always have a chance for large losses. Take everything one day at a time maybe stop trading for a while - go outside and be around friends and family. I know it's a tough loss but you are still young and you will rebuild. after some time off look over your portfolio and try to find where you went wrong.

&#x200B;

Good luck and don't worry you will rebuild!
Sorry for your loss - that sucks, it really does. Sometimes we take it as a blow to our EGO - I sold a business a couple years ago and lost about $100k that was owed to me from the sale. That hurt, and it takes a while to be ok with it and move on.
Try growing some ouid, I started it for fun a few months back when I was down bad. Now it literally pays for its self in weight. Just a thought 💭 and if you’re not a smoker it’s pure profits. Keep your head up brotha. This to shall pass 🍃
So you need help with dealing with the depression or making the money back? Because I understand the missing money is what is making you depressed. As long as you own the stocks they may be down in value but some of them should eventually go back up, I hate to say it may take months to over a year. My situation is like this: I have a portfolio that is seriously messed up with stocks in the 50% loss and some 70% which I regret getting into. But I have some money to survive the rest of the year for my bills. And I have a small amount of cash with margin to trade when I am ready to, right now things seem to be picking up but not really what I'm looking for. I am able to trade with that small amount and make small amounts to continue to pay bills. So what I'm saying is that you need to wait a while until you have a portion of that money back to trade with while you build back up. By the way, in a crash that happened in 2016 I sold everything at a loss and should have held everything because one year later I would have doubled my money. Try to be hopeful. You don't have that recognized loss unless you push the button and sell it off completely. Try to wait it out. You will have to trade with more strategy and be more conservative while you are bag holding some stuff. Later you can get into investing long and trading short on the side. Diverse portfolio in my opinion is a terrible thing because everything goes down together in situations like this. Diversification in my world is being able to deal with these issues, while still being able to wait things out, and having money to trade with. Then building back up and selling off those mistakes. Take time to analyze your old trades and stop trading crappy stuff. Don't get manipulated by Youtbers. Learn to spot the real opportunities. Also to end this story all that money I lost in 2016 which was six figures I finally was able to break even this past year 2020. Huge accomplishment. This will be the first year I'm in the green. Obviously the money I made back I used to live off but that is a huge accomplishment. I made it back with some long positions in Microsoft and basically made most of that back in the past 18 months of real focused day trading. As for the depression part you need to disconnect your emotions from this situation the way someday you will master and disconnect them from your trades. Don't get attached to tickers. They are just symbols. If you get emotional and get attached to specific stocks because you want to brag about them you need to stop trading until you get your emotions under control and focus on the real goal which is to make money. And I'm not responding to rub it in. I think you started trading and this happens to everyone when they get sucked in. That's why you have to watch out for the worst scenario because if other entities are manipulating the market you need to be careful you just focus on recognizing your profits not maneuvering around their chaos.
So what kind of trading were you doing? E.g. Are you a support and resistance trader, a breakout trader, a dip buyer...? Helps to know. If you're trading breakouts I'd say... maybe just don't 😂.
Fuck bro that’s rough, maybe take some time to just chill out and get your mind right. Hope for a market crash and if there is, invest in the blue chip stocks that will rebound nicely and you may be able to double, triple or more your investment.
Read trade mindfully by Gary Dayton.  Really helps with the mind game.
Education is vital and expensive.  There are no shortcuts.  Good luck on your journey, and never ever give up!!
You WILL figure this out, it may not seem like it at this point, but you will.

People have talked a lot about a risk management strategy, and I'd like to offer that you can expand that beyond day trading, and manage risk by diversifying that portfolio into something less volatile (albeit, less exciting). I know there's no adrenaline rush and it's boring AF, but have you considered taking a percentage of your investment and putting in towards ETFs or index funds? It may be worth opening a separate ""safety"" brokerage account that you never ever touch, and transferring some of your funds into it. I did this myself and every time I log in I can breathe a sigh of relief, even when the rest of my account is down 5-10% on the day.

I understand this is a day trading subreddit and it might not be popular here, but short- and long-term strategies don't need to be mutually exclusive. 

Best of luck friend, you got this!
I’m sorry that happened to you. It sucks. But on the bright side, you’re 22. You have a ton of time to recover from this. I know a bunch of people who were 22 and blew that much money on a stupid ass car or sports gambling. Cars depreciate. You took 37,000 and turned it into 2.6. You’ll have plenty of time to make up $35,000. You’ve learned a painful but valuable lesson, there is a big difference between gambling which is what you were doing, and investing which is sitting down and doing the hard work of determining value and not meme hype.  By the time you hear of a stock opportunity, it’s already too late. Everybody here eventually learns that. You either have to be early in it or you have to sit down, understand how to measure the true value of the stock. Even stocks like Tesla an apple and Boeing are way overvalued.  Get the right time and you might benefit from a rip. The next day it may dip.  Just this week I bought a stock and rock 62% growth two days in a row, and on the third day because I didn’t have a plan I went 20% in the hole. Never make a stock by without having a plan. Immediately set a stop loss. That’s some thing I learned Long ago but obviously didn’t follow it always. I’ve had some wins, a lot of sideways trades and a few losses and the losses hurt me  a lot worse than the moons feel good, at least to me.

In a nutshell, you lost some money. It happens to people all the time whether it be stocks or roulette or craps or poker Or buying a dumb ass car. Many people do it in their later years and they’re screwed because they don’t have their whole life of them to earn back. You’re 22 and you have a shit ton of time to make up money. Learn from your mistakes, learn how to value stocks, certainly learn how to sell options.  Selling a covered call can really make a dent in a bad investment loss.  Keep your head up and good luck.
22 with 37k. Nice
Did u sell or are u trading options ?
At least your young, and relatively speaking you didn’t lose much compared to how much you will make in the long run. 
It does suck, but theres nothing you can do, and time will make it better! Hang in there bud.
It’s is a kick in the gut, what I’ve done when I paid my market tuition was stopped trading for 90 days and kept watching and went on with everything else as usual, got back in the game back made my money back in a couple months. With the market trading sideways right now is a good time to take a break
The only real advice you should listen to right now is to stop. Take 3-6 months off trading all together other than buying index funds. In 6 months work towards picking stocks again. In a year come back to day trading. Get your head straight before you do.

I am all for yolo, high risk and day trading. I do it. I am down quite a few thousand on PLTR  because I bought 1.5k shares and lots of spreads and calls when it was over $25. 

But you need to stop trying to day trade. Take what you have, put it in an index fund and chill for a while. Take 3-6 months off from the market. Mentally you aren't ready to handle day trading. Sounds like you didnt cut losers early and kept on chasing trades hoping something would work. So take a step back.

In 6 months come back and start picking stocks again for short term trades but not day trades. Recover and build up some capital, keep a safe investment, and then in a year come back to day trading. The time off and short term picks will focus you more and let you narrow down a strategy to stick to while giving you a while to keep learning. You need to trade both sides of the market, long and short to really be successful. A market pullback should not be the reason a day trader is losing money, as they should be shorting on the way down. 

Maybe day trading just isn't for you, and that's just fine. There is a reason so many people fail at it. The $SPY is up nearly 10% the past month from March low, the returns from the general market are pretty attractive right now.
You could be 32,42,52,62,72,82. 

It’s early in the game. But you must know 80% of day traders will lose money. This is a brutal game where winners attempt to take all. 

I suggest you switch your style of investing if you want peace of mind and never want to feel like this again. Go listen to some Peter Lynch and talk some sense back into yourself. 

Also, good luck and stay disciplined.
Sorry man. I'm 24 and started trading around the same time this year. Honestly this could be me right now had I not cut my losses on some bad plays. 

Losing sucks, but we're so young that our best investment we can make right now is in our future earning potential. Work hard at whatever you do, stay healthy, and keep at it. 

When you get that money back, which you will, only play with what you're willing to lose.
Go back and figure out what you did wrong. Write it down. Track each and every trade and learn what you did right and what you did wrong.  Fuck, post it on here. People will give you feedback. Last years bull market was easy, this market is not. And for fucks sake do NOT park your money in GME (I hope that person was joking). You need to start saving to build your account back up. Take the time you’re going to have to spend saving to study. Watch more traders learn more styles and find one you want to hone in on. 

Also, don’t hide your pain. That shit just makes it worse. Share whats going on w the people closest to you, 95% of them will tell you to stop trading. Maybe you should, but thats your decision. If you want to do this long term your going to get busted in the chops. Just like boxing you learn by taking one on the chin. Its up to you if you wanna get back in the ring and its a serious question you need to ask yourself. 

Like others said, you have time on your side. You have no idea how important that is. If you haven’t already learn about tax sheltered compounding interest and do the math. Your so far ahead of the curve its not even funny. 

Good luck.
Hey man, I'm sorry to hear this. That really sucks. I have been there....MORE THAN A FEW TIMES. I never learn. I know that feeling, that depression all to well. Nothing really helps but time. Its like a bad breakup, only time heals. YOU WILL GET BACK TO NORMAL, emotionally. Accept this for what it is and try to look forward. Best of luck my man.
Sorry buddy! Take a break away from the screen! I was up huge today and it got cut in half! It’s always good to take profit. We will have our days. Stay focused and stay in the game.
I would put it all in GME and wait for the squeeze, in the meantime do something else with your life.

This isnt financial advice
I too have had some expensive lessons. It's almost a right of passage.
Put those 2.7k in amc! Take a break and leave it there! Those 2.7k will hive you over $200k 
Trust me. 

That’s what I did.. I was so depressed and was losing... I decided to throw everything in AmC and now waiting for it to moon but using Thai tone to go back and check out what I did wrong and also learn more.
Try the casino if you want to gamble. That big of a loss in this short amount of time is insane. I’d recommend paper trading and backtesting an objective strategy before putting any money back in the market.
sometimes important lessons are expensive.
I feel for you bro. I had about 60k and now I’m down to 9k.
Not selling my shares tho. GME to the moon. Hedge funds r fuk.
You are 22 and healthy.  Money can't buy that.
Your 22. You have lots of time. I let a good chunk of capital sit in a savings account doing nothing for 15 years because I thought the stock market was too crazy and risky. Once I had experience in my mid 30's the fear went away and I deeply regretted all the time and possible gains I could have made over those years. I completely missed FANG and other obvious big gainers that would have given me crazy returns if I was sitting in them over the decade.

Your lifetime gains because you are now aware of the markets and their potential to increase your wealth at such a young age will far outstrip the money you lost. So just save a bit from each paycheck and keep building your account.
Should’ve not day traded as a beginner. Remember the 90/90/90 rule. 90% of day traders lose 90% of their capital in the first 90 days
Show graph mate, I can't get off just with text alone
37k? You could've invested in real estate buddy, atleast then you'd actually have control over your *assets.*
This can happen to people who just jump in and get the near term positive results, you lose sight of the big picture - results today are not indicative of results tomorrow. Experience helps you navigate this and learn when to adjust to the ever changing dynamics of the market. DayTrading is *not easy*, it's like any other career. You have to put in the time to educate and hone your skill.

That big of a loss will be painful, it may even feel like the end of the world. But it isn't, if you truly want to do this you take it as an expensive lesson in your education and get back up.

If I were you, I'd pull back from live trading and switch to a paper trading account until you hone your risk management skills. Find a trading community / chatroom to learn from. There's quite a lot, make sure to pick the right one (one that focuses on educating).
Me sitting in the fire of my SPY calls.

Just burned my last week of green like Cheech and Chong last Tuesday. 

It's alright man. You'll be back.

Success is built on a foundation of failure. Dont let the failure get to you. It only wins if you don't take away knowledge. 

Chin up young buck! You got plenty of time to recover!
You did it the right way. I was expensive, but it was a nice lesson. Next time when you make that 50k you will have experience and won’t do it again. I’ve been there too, everyone has. Do be sad, be happy men.
The market is in Mega Expert Mode right now.
Don't t give up, my friend... I think you share your loss porn story with millions of Trading beginners ...myself included .  . ..just try to keep balance and try  to learn .... I did so too... Well, maybe noone of us will be a perfect trader, but possibly WE get successfull Traders...... Heads Up!! To the moon!!!!🚀🚀🚀
Don’t day trade, it’s gambling! Better buy and hold shares
Jumping in, 29. Exact same thing has happened over the past 2 months for me as well.
A lot of good advice here, my advice is that you take a break from trading now. Take a break until that feeling of revenge trading is gone. Then start over with small amounts because I am sure you have learned a lot, you are most likely a good trader, the market has been brutal this spring. Everybody is hurting. You lost money with many others, focus on your well being. Smell the flowers sort of speak. You will feel when you are ready to trade once more, you are awesome.
It's ok to fail. Hopefully, even though you've fallen, you fell on your back. If so, then you are still looking up where you want to be.  You are the one that decides if that is or isnt the case. Its ok to be upset and its ok to feel discouraged. Feeling those things means you still want to get where you were headed. Take time away. Taking a break isn't giving up. Its doing what you need to do to take care of yourself. That is the most important. Life is always going to hit you hard and where it hurts most. Who you are is defined by the way you can take those hits and keep going forward. Remember the losses and let them inspire you to learn. Remember that you were already able to win so that you know it is possible. Even if it is devastating now it can be something you look back on when you made it. Get up when you're ready and try again. Best wishes
So you started in a market that was mostly only going up and now that it has stopped you are depressed?  Wait until you get a couple crashes under your belt.
I am 51 years old and have lost everything that I own twice ( houses, cars, money, clothes, I mean everything!!!) It seems tough right now and it is depressing but I promise you..... you will survive this and still be able to have a good life!! The material things are just that. Learn from your mistakes and vow to never do them again and slowly start back down the path of life with a few bruises but a better education on life!!! You got this. Don’t ever give up and keep your head up!!! You aren’t the only one who has ever done this. Look at me.... I am so hardheaded that it took me 2 times to figure it out....lol
Hey, you still got 2.6k in your pocket!

Listen, I don't mean to make you feel bad, not at all!  That is the good news!  

Coming here and letting out some emotions and asking for support is the right step towards a healthy mind to restart.  I know you worked your butt off to save that 37k.  At 22, you did that.  This was a very expensive lesson to learn and yes ""It's only money!"".  You have your health at this point I assume but you need a pick me up - mentally!

You need support - please talk to your family and friends and start fresh.

You've got no choice but to start over!  Find a job or get an extra job, put aside as much as you can and start saving and INVESTING and not YOLO it all away!  You're young and you need to separate a long term investing account and a short term trading account and the latter should be like 5-25% max based on your risk tolerance.  Having these separated should keep you from losing it all.

Good luck!
Don't shit on yourself... most traders have some similar experience. I blew my 1st and half of my second accounts. Took me 2 years to see the market properly, have been in since 2008.

I don't remember where I read this but it's on my wall above my screens: ""There is a huge difference form learning from you mistakes and berating yourself.

One is positive and results in better results the other leads to buying stock in ROPE. Which is NOT the answer. Suggestion as it helped me a lot (I have no ties to and will not profit in any way if you but it) ISBN 978-0-471-26761-4

Lick your wounds and learn from the mistakes, keep your eye on the prize.
Trading or not, everyone goes through bad experiences despite good intentions. Health, job, relationships and many other aspects of life have their ups and downs. The other day I was beating myself for not buying a house when we could all these years. We are not young anymore and home ownership looks really a dream that will not be fulfilled given the market. So in my case it’s a loss from not taking action. No way you can beat yourself up for how things turn out. Just be patient.
Zoom out and look at what you still have a young age, your health and most likely a lot mor. You tried, failed and learned, that's called experience and you won't repeat this one. Just keep trying and find a more sustainable strategy or move on and find some other hobby. Do some psychedelics and get some new perspectives, what you lost is infinitely small in comparison to what you have. I've lived my whole life without getting a job or an income, I've led a fulfilling life without money and always tried to find ways to get by without money rather than earning them. Right now I'm looking into it because I have a goal that requires some and I want to invest because I find it an intriguing hobby. But in the end even if I lost it all it wouldn't be my life quality or reason to live I lost, it would just delay me to get to my goal that ultimately is optional.
You good bro, it’s a learning experience.

You’ll get it back and you’ll be more careful and cautious as you compound your account.

This too shall pass big dog. This too shall pass.
It is a horrible feeling to lose money - even worse when you're disgusted by your own behavior that led to the losses. While I never blew up my account I am very familiar with that feeling of total disgust for oneself after making emotional trading decisions and incurring losses. One day toward the beginning of my foray into trading I caught this monstrous short trade on Nasdaq futures - made $600 in a few minutes. I was so confident that I started scalping like a degen and gave back not only all the profits but also another $1000 in losses. I went from feeling like the smartest trader to the stupidest in the span of thirty minutes. I felt sick to my stomach for the rest of the day.

In hindsight that experience was a blessing. Seeing how tied my emotions were to my outcomes was the first step I took in decoupling the two. ""The first step is to admit you have a problem.""

If you want trading to be your career and no obstacle will deter you then I am sure you'll look back on this event in a few decades and be immensely thankful you learned this lesson with $50k instead of with $500k or more. If you go on to have a successful career in trading, these losses will look like small tuition costs compared to your career earnings.

Now if this experience is too much to overcome you can forget about trading, get a 'normal' job, and invest in mutual funds or ETF's like the majority of Americans do. Work and save hard for forty years and you can retire a king.

Whichever path you decide to walk, this experience was surely formative and I believe it is a tremendous opportunity for growth with many lessons to be learned. I know that it feels like the end of the world now, but I believe that some day you will look back on it with gratitude!
Take time to be upset first and then move on with your life.

I've been at rock bottom financially. You have to look at your situation as it is not how it could have been or was.

It's time to pick your ass up off the ground and figure out what's next. You've got this.
i totally understand man. the market took back most of my crypto gains today and i've lost probably 30% of my stock portfolio in the past two weeks. I had a strategy i was working on where i was day trading options on etfs that fell apart too. I was making money in the paper account and thought i had everything figured out until today, the underlying dropped like 5 points in under a minute and i couldn't get the stop loss filled. my strategy basically shattered and i realized this cant realistic work in the real world. Im totally fucked
Seeing you guys lift one another up gives me hope. Let us all find our way to the millionaires club one day
Follow buysellshort on Twitter and buy the swings he’s on. He’s right literally 95% of the time. Free money. 

He’s also got a discord that more thorough and specific with his picks. It’s all free btw I’m not trying scam your depressed ass. Enjoy.
I have had a small setback recently. I'm back to base hits. I need to hold off on home runs for now!
Hear you, my friend. The same happened to me and told to myself I was no trader, I was not nothing. It all started with a study mistake. I had done good but tried to learn more about options. Big mistake. No matter how much I tried to craft my entries and exist, it all felt like gamble. The same day I made a second terrible mistake, I tried to recover it all in 4 trades, they were all right, but they bounced too much, I got a bit of flash crash as well. Long story short, was left with 0,008 usd worth. Did not believe. Still in shock.
That’s the way it goes. Sometimes the best play is cash.
Difficulty in trading especially in day trading is that people think they are sensible but they really are not unless they train hard for it. Animal brain takes over and emotions rise. There is no hope for intelligent decision making in that state. If you want learn trading rewiring your brain is out most importance. It's unfortunate that you lost this much to learn that, but you are young and can make that money many times over.
Don't trade for awhile - you are not in shape for that now imo. You just risk losing the rest.
I used the hard hitting reality as motivation to set a better game plan, rules, and focused my trading strategy down to a very small pool of stocks. I journaled every move I made from my first daytrade and kept notes so it helped formulate patterns and rules. I will re-test rules every so often, but really what I did was dust off my pants and pulled the chair back up. Your profit goal percentages are still the same even if you’re only investing with $10 now instead of $XXX,xxx
Bright side is you can still grow it back with 2.6k , it will just take longer if you use proper risk management. But you aren't out of the game. That is a HUGE plus.

I struggle with self confidence, self esteem, ect. and while I am far too new to trading to offer real trading advice, in regards to your mental health I'll say this. 

You are more than your successes and failures. You are more than what you've done or haven't done. You blew up your account. That really sucks. At this point, you have two options, either will define how this story ends. Regardless of the path you choose, money should never become more important than our wellbeing. While the world still doesn't operate this way, it's important we keep ourselves centered on what matters, and allow the rest to fall into place. 

You can stop trading, write off the loss and act like it never happened. Lots of people do this. They try trading, lose big, get burned and never go back. For many, this is the best option. 

You can accept the financial loss as a very expensive learning experience, cut your share size down dramatically and go back to studying the fundamentals of trading until you consistently show profits with small share sizes, and then you start to scale back up, regardless of how long that takes. You don't give up and in some time, you look back on your account and see that you have recovered all of your losses using your new more informed trading strategy. 

Let me know if you want to talk more, I'm here.
Take that 2500 and go theta gang from here on out. Start a weekly atm csp say on something like palantir, and lock up 60$ every week until you can do 2 csp and repeat. Won’t take away the pain but what you need more than anything right now is a win. From there the sky is the limit. Never deviate from wheeling and it could change your life and your mind. All begins here with a man and his 2500$.
On the bright side, you still have 2.6k left.  

You can take that and apply proper risk management and strategy to, without letting your emotions get the better of you or trying to revenge trade, and get up again.  

Sorry for your loss, but even the fact you managed to save 37k at 22 is pretty damn good, I'm sure you'll bounce back even though it's a hard hit to take.
Keep your head up young buck ! Is material ! You really need to focus on the future and what you actually learned in this journey. You have some much life in front of you. God bless bro
Wow, almost exactly same here to the number! At least with amount invested. Started with a few speculative small trades (total account investment $1,500), did marginally well, so kept feeding it until my account was over $55,000 on $34,000 or so invested. Thought I was on a good momentum until the floor dropped out with the crash in February. Account was around $18,000 just a few days ago. 

Seems as if the deadlines the SEC put in place have started to turn things around; once the deadline hit yesterday, it’s been consistent gains across the board.  Very small but sweeping across the portfolio. 

Even though our losses are different, there are a few things to consider. If you had any longs that have kicked the bucket but you still hold; keep holding. If your losses truly are locked in and complete, try to learn from it, but remember these losses are just a moment in time and a snapshot of your total wealth potential over your lifetime. Take the lessons and integrate them, and you’re still in less debt than a college education, but with typically higher earning potential.

If you have the big stuff taken care of... happy family, good health, roof over the head and heat in winter... you’re already in a good spot.
It's ok to feel upset, but you are young and you have your whole life ahead of you.  You can recover.  Learn every lesson you can from what went wrong.  If you are willing, find a mentor that can go over your account with you (not me, I'm old and dumb) and maybe help you see mistakes you don't even realize you made.  Best of luck!
I had a kid with a narcissistic sociopath woman.   18 years of hell.... About 5 more left.   I'm going to make it, asked you will too.   You're young and you will rebound
I haven’t read the other comments, but right now if I were you I would buy as many MVIS shares as that will get you and then don’t touch them until the buy out is announced, as that should boost your balance back up by quite a lot
*earn your risk* - start at literally $10 risk per trade. that means $10 net is lost when you go your stop distance x number of shares. if you have positive expectancy (look up the formula, journal all your trades, and *calculate it*) for 2-3 months, up to $20. repeat every 2-3 months until you get to 0.5% account risk per trade. then scale that up *slowly* over the next year at least, to 1%. max ever to allow yourself, ever, even if you've done this 20 years and are making money every year - 2% per trade. period.
Try paper trading for a couple of months until you figure out the best strategy for you. Subscribing to a trading journal like trademetria might help you analyze your entry/exit mistakes especially when you are in a slump.
I can relate If that helps. I’m a 32 year old coast guard veteran been working in aviation for over 10 years.. I got into day/swing trading part time last year because I truly like trading, and partly because I was severely burnt out on aviation, (especially in the civilian world) and wanted to have a secondary source of income to help relieve the anxiety of work.. finally decided to quit my well paying career and take trading full time. It was going well for a couple months there, but lately it’s been a string of non stop red days.. my risk management is decent, but it can definitely be discouraging.
With steady percentage gains and good money management,  you can be back to 37k in 2 months.     You're 22 years old....be patient.    Learn from your mistakes.
How’d you get 37k at 22 years old? It stings I’m sure, but you’ll be fine. Most 22 year olds don’t have the 2.6k you’re left with now.
First off, welcome to the club. I've blown up multiple accounts over the years in excess of $50k. I've put golf clubs through monitors and Macbook's through drywall in rage from losing it all. It's going to burn for sometime, don't let it get the best of you. This moment in your life is where you grow, get stronger, and move forward. You can't change what happened yesterday, but you have control of not fucking up tomorrow. Leave the revenge trading to the other suckers. 

Let your pain the fuck out of you. Keeping the pain and rage locked up in the cage, which is you, will end badly for you and those around you. Find some healthy outlet to release the fury, pain, and anger. Maybe some physical exercise, banging hookers, raging out at a rage room, etc. Do what works for you.

 Also, consider making investments more so than making trades. Buy shares instead of risky ass options that can blow your shit up in a matter of seconds. Steer clear of any hype trains and meme pumped stocks as well.

Keep in mind, this too shall pass. I hope this helped you feel better. 

Now change your tampon and get back on the field Billy.
You had a loss of +/- 35k. You're 22. It sounds strange, but for your future life 35k means nothing. Work hard and put the money in passive investments, if you feel that active trading is too risky. If i did this from 22 i would be much richer today, so you're on the right way learning this lessons at this age.
You'll make it back.
Take profits move on. Say it with me now. ""TAKE PROFITS AND MOVE ON""


You still got this. If you're willing to watch your account go down why quit before its actually up? Gotta set limits. 5% 10% 15% 20% gains gradually can feel better in the long term than 50% or more in losses short term.

I'm 24 should have gotten in when I was 18. Cant stress on the shoulda coulda woulda's and keep that same attitude you had when you were up before you realize this was only the beginning of your financial freedom.

Some of us learn lessons the hard way, welcome to the club.
Dude your only 22 years old. You have so much time to make that up. Learn from your mistakes. If I could give up all my money to be 22 years old and start over I would. I am 41 years old and started trading the same time you did in Jan/Feb it was way too easy. I was making money fast, then everything fell. I’ll still down in most stocks I bought but I’m holding and some are starting to recover. Hang in there!
you had 37k and you're 22? How's that happen?  


You have all the time in the world. Buy some Crypto or something. Buy some weed stocks while they're cheap (it's gonna be fully legal real soon for your life)...EV stuff...or guns and ammo for the fall or civilization...  


Whatever you wish you had done 5 years ago and sat on...do that now. You're not going to win the lottery.   


You're still in a better position now that most people are at your age. Only now, you have a little experience and if a pandemic or market crash happens again, you know it's gonna come back up.  


I wish I had 20 years to build. Be patient. You'll be fine.  


Remember...you pay less taxes if you hold for a year. A year is nothing at all for you...you have lots of them left.
2020 was the best bull run. I lost 100k in that year. I’m 27 years old. My heart sank when my account dropped below 25K. I still tried to bring it up with single day trades and then over night my account dropped below 2K. I sat there still hopeful. And honestly I’m still hopeful. I learnt that impatience doesn’t get you anywhere in the stock market. I learned emotions doesn’t get you anywhere. Were those lessons worth a 100K, most likely not. But that’s what I had to pay to learn that. Now I’m back to my day job, trying to earn my capital back only to go back to trading stocks, but more wisely and conservatively. I’m already up to 8K in 3 months. It’s not much but one step at a time for me. Losing hope is the last thing you want to do. Being persistent and ambitious is what’s going to make you. If you are determined then no amount of money can bring you down. Money can always be earned but motivation needs to come from within and the drive needs to be there.
I'm so sorry.  Confidence is so important.  Take a break for a week or 2 and then make a plan and stick with it.  Things will turn around for you if you stick to your plan and get your confidence back.  I'm rooting for you!!!
Happened to me too took 40k to 120k back down to 30k so I feel your exact emotions. It’ll be okay grasshopper.
So you lost 35k of your initial investment Who cares!!!! You’ve learnt your lesson now end off. Pick your self up be positive think of it not as a loss but as an investment into your education. You’ve got this, You can do it I believe in you, We all do. Get back in the game do your thing. you can do it. Don’t beat yourself up You’ve got this.
You learned an expensive lesson. Take some time off from trading but don’t give up. 

Go look at the Dow Jones Industrial average for a century. 

Then go look at the M2 Money Stock chart

(TradingView has both)


The government prints money. Stocks go up. 

1929 crash, 1940s WW2, 1987 crash, 2001 crash, 2008 crash, 2020 pandemic crash 

All ended up as buying opportunities. 

Because the government prints money.


You will bounce back but don’t give up.
Take it as a challenge, Hey, better to loose 34k than 2 million right? The important thing is that you learn. Plus you're 22! you can make that money up on a side hustle.
Without diminishing the pain and financial loss, I want to tell you that you are still very young and can come back from this setback.  If you decide to continue trading, (1) find a strat/setup, (2) paper trade it for a month or longer, (2) keep a journal discussing each trade, (3) track the stats/success of the setup and think how to improve it if necessary, (4) write rules (general, risk management, and specific to setup), (5) once you become confident in your success after enough trades (25-50 or more), go live and only trade that setup.  If you can backtest the setup, you can shorten the paper trading time period.

If you want to do any other setups, go through the same process.
I'm turning 36 on the 28th. I've been trading for a long time and I've lost a considerable amount when I started. What you have that you don't realize is time. You have your whole life ahead of you to make that money back. I, on the other hand, will be completed fucked if I lost a considerable amount with my age. I have a mortgage, car payments, kids, etc. Take in stride and learn from this lesson. It's only a loss when you didn't learn the lesson.

Trading with emotions is BAD. I used to be like that too. I would chase the money after a big loss but all you're doing is digging yourself a bigger hole. I set a daily loss and gain limit and when I hit that number I walk away. Unless the market is really favorable then I will keep trading. Tomorrow is a brand new day so I just rinse and repeat. The hardest thing to overcome for a day trader is emotions. Once you can take emotions out of the equation you'll become a much better trader.

Don't let it bring you down. Keep your head up and look to better days ahead. If you need someone to talk to, DM me. I wish you the best of luck.
Man, that really sucks.  You had a nice nest egg and now it's pretty much gone. 

Here's something to learn from this

You can come back.  You're young, you will be ok


Next time, set up a long term and trade with small positions.
That’s rough and sorry to hear it.
Keep trading until you recover and make some more and repeat the loss all over again. And when that happens, you won't worry about today.
Wow sucks to already be rich when starting in this industry. 

Treat it like a career. Baby steps from paper trading all the way up to 5-6 digit position sizes. Increase your size maybe once a month if you have good stats.

If you don’t back to paper trading.
So many people did this exact same thing. We all fell into the trap of the bull run. Just continue to reinvest and make smarter decisions, which most of us are going to continue to do as well
I’m literally in the same path as you, I’m 21, lost 40-50k . I originally said to myself that I’m going to invest majority of it and set aside some for day trading. I broke the rule and traded options and actually 3x my money but it went downhill from there.  

There’s nothing we can do besides learn from our mistakes and keep learning
Where the fuck do you get 37K at 22 years old? Jesus h Christ my life would be changed with that kinda money. Just be happy you have money man.
You're only 22.  Chalk it up and do it again next year.  This time, don't screw it up as bad.
You did it once, you can do it again, this time with more knowledge and fundamentals and honestly even a better understanding of your emotions. 

I hate to make this reference, but I think it’s relevant. How many millionaires have went totally bankrupt to only come back harder and become even wealthier? The same thing applies, learn from it, and move forward. You cannot give up in life, if you just keep pushing and chasing your dreams you’ll fucking make it bro. Chin up, god speed 🤜🏼
As others have said, basically everyone loses big in the beginning, some more than others, but the bottom line is almost always the same. I started with 27k and had to refund my account twice bc I dropped below the pdt limit (lost about 7k in the first three months daytrading and anther 10k ”investing“ in pennystocks). 

I‘ve been consistently profitable for the last 4 months despite the market taking several hits and small caps momentum slowing to a crawl. I’m not getting rich by any means but I can pay my bills with the coolest job I could dream of.

Reading my journal entries from the first few months is mind-boggling in hindsight. I traded 200-400 share positions and had a couple of trades where I lost over $500 in seconds. In November I hit the reset button, reduced my share size to 10 and focused on a few setups that I was reasonably good at. 

Working on clean execution with baby size and meticulously journaling and analyzing all my trades was the biggest game changer in my trading and I think I would’ve long given up with my money gone hadn’t I stepped back and re-evaluated.
I feel you. I started with 37k. Got to 210k from Jan to feb. then from feb 11th till April 12th I proceeded to lose 50% of my profits and took me down to 118k... I realized then that I just wasn’t the right personality type for trading. Not yet. I chased the high and let rules mean nothing. Don’t get back in to it until you have your mindset rewired and you follow your rules to a t.
Look at your losses and realize and pay attention to what you did wrong that made you lose those trades.

Compare them with the trades that you did win. And adapt you entry and exit strategy. I mean you were able to go from 32k to 52k that means that in somewhere in your strategy you are correct.

Perfect that thing and keep at it and you’ll build your account back up. And you’re young, so take the time to learn because you are already ahead by doing and not just standing on the sidelines.

And also talk to someone close to you, you said you hide it from everyone. And trust me there is no need to, some people will tell you to quit but the right ones will cheer you up. Find those and hold them close, because you will have those days and those people can help to make things better. But overall adapt/change your strategy and get back at it. 💪🏽
When I blew up my account I struggled with it for a loooong time. As hard as it may be, try to see it as a learning experience. The emotional trading is what really screwed things up for me. I’d sell a position and then watch it skyrocket without me, get into a position without stop losses and watch them plummet. That all began last year in July. I’m only just now starting to feel good about my positions and making profit again... it’s not the same and I dream about making that money back, but I don’t dwell on it. You can’t approach it that way. You’re not going to make a bunch of ten-baggers off the bat... it’s going to take time. If you keep trying to learn, you can be really good at this someday.. but know when to cut your losses and walk away. Take a break if you need to. You’re 22, your life is just beginning. I didn’t even start trading until I was 30ish.. you’ll be okay.
You still have $2.6k. learn from your mistakes and keep building. Have a plan and stick to it. Figure out exactly what you did wrong and how you will not do it this time around. Do the work. Give yourself some time to feel sorry for yourself, like 20 mins, then get back to work. That's the only thing that is going to make you feel better. Build those habits and systems.
You’re 22 y/o so take solace in the fact most 30 yos don’t even have 10k
The fact you are reflecting on this and seeking advice is confirmation you’ll be back
Best of luck soldier
Watch Jared Wesley's videos on YouTube. He features issues like yours before his lectures and teaches how to avoid them while teaching how to trade.

There's no way to make you feel better besides telling you to get back on the saddle and ride.

You have $2,000. The market is still there. Learn before you ride, though. Many who make your mistake continue to make that mistake. Therefore, you have learned a lesson, but you haven't learned to trade.
22 is young af. I was living paycheck to paycheck until I was 26. You’ve plenty of time to make money.
You’re still young homie. Just think about all the millions of people in way more student debt paying interest for 30 years. You’ll come back from this even stronger.
That's definitely a tough loss...we all make mistakes it's what we learn from them...

You definitely have to change your strategy and maybe don't ever trade speculative stocks again...you could win....or you can lose....

I myself don't gamble...that's how you win every single time.
❤️
❤️
Here's my take on this. You learned a lot. You definitely lost a lot, but you learned too. The good news is that with the right plays, you can make that money back.

Just keep educating yourself and for a while just make smaller trades with less downside.

You cant lose until you quit. So don't quit. You're obviously not afraid to go for plays that could have made you rich, so you obviously have the balls for this.

Just keep at it. Take the L and move on. But stay in the game and keep learning / self educating.
22...I know its hard to hear it but you are literally still so young the money is completely inconsequential in the long run, take it as a learning lesson, keep your head up and continue kicking ass in other aspects of your life
I'm 33, I wish I could have learned the lesson you're learning, when I was 22.  This will pass, there's a lot of life to live. You'll make more lonely, you'll trade again if that's what you want to do, you'll find fulfillment in a variety of things available in life. You will be fine.
I assume much of this is from options trading, the only way you could lose so much so quickly. Bottomline: you never play options with money you can’t afford to lose... what you did is called gambling, not investing. Only disciplined, experienced individuals should be trading options right now. I think the growth success of the market the last 12 months has fooled young investors into thinking this is easy.
Meh if youre 22 and have 37k to burn, youre better off than the majority of the world population at this point, regardless of age.

Youll be alright.
2.6k may sound less for you. For other people like me, starting with 100 and making it to 3k, it is quite a lot. If people are able to make 100 or 500 into 3k, then you can surely get back on your feet with the 2.6k as well!
Man I don’t know why this sub doesn’t just say it but you have a gambling addiction.

It needs to be said that playing high IV tickers expecting to get rich is a recipe for disaster especially for inexperienced traders who have no risk management or position sizing. Why play low float tickers? Learn on the highly liquid, quality big guys (even if a lot of them are algo traded).

I would bet that most of your positions were close to all in.

Tuition is expected but it’s not a shining medal or badge of honor. You lost money because of your mistakes.

I hope you learn from them if this is what you want to do long term and yes it’s just money please don’t do anything stupid. They do say the best traders are born from losses. Live to trade another day.
22 yo with 37k, damn bro I swear times have changed, at 22 everyone I knew was lucky to have a few grand in savings
The job is to protect the principal, not make money and you do that by making good trades with precise entries and exits. Trade to trade well not make money. You’re young and you need a batters memory, focus on being at the plate not yesterday’s strikeout. You’ll be fine. Great work getting that capitol together.
I lost 230K in february and 157K of that was actually a failure of my brokerage rather than me making a bad trade
I'm 38 and I've never had 52k liquid worth in my life. It's a bad beat but you'll fine.
Gambler’s anonymous.
I’m 36 and you’ve already lost more money than I’ve ever had to my name. So if you managed this by 22 I’m sure you’ll bounce back.
It’s about perspective my friend. Same happened to me, look at it as paying a tuition. You’re self taught, you know what not to do now. $2000 is a reasonable amount. If you can go from 36-52k, then you can definitely flip 2k to 4 then 6 then 10...
Expensive lesson but think how much better prepared you are for what’s ahead. You’re still VERY young and will rebound in no time.
Wait a few weeks for the correction to end and put it all on Bitcoin.  Don’t trade, just walk away for a couple of years.  Thank me later.
File for unemployment.
Imagine how good it's gonna feel when you take your account from 2k back up to +50k! Hang in there! Also what do you do that you had 37k laying around as a 22yo?
You don’t know trading till you’ve blown up and account or two. You’re young...and this happens to the vast majority starting out. It’s a lesson just a brutal one.
In 2008 my husband and I were on our way to become multi millionaires. The market crashed and we slowly lost everything over a 10 year course along with multiple lawsuits from our development project tanking from the drop in value. I don’t sweat it and I’m still standing at 39. Redirect your focus and just plan to only buy and hold crypto. Trading is to risky. Keep your head up. Wishing you the best.
You are so young. You learned a lesson the hard way. Things will get better my friend, let this be your start to your comeback story
Dude you’re 22 years old. The fact you even had 37k to trade with is mind blowing. I’m 23 with a full time job and a college degree barley have 10k to my name. Only trade with $2,000 lol. You just learned the hard way and at 22 you’re way ahead of most of your peers. You’ve got a long time to make it back and then some!!
So how do we coordinate a giant short to help get back your cash ?
I know this won't make you feel better but when I was your age I was thousands in debt already. I dug that debt hole for another decade. It sucks you lost your money, I get it. Every time I lose money trading it stings bad. But you CAN build it back slowly and cautiously. Take time to let your emotions settle and come up with a plan. Be extra cautious in the next couple months while things are bearish. Trust me, you'll recover faster from this than it took me to recover for thousands in credit card debt. Hang in there.
Take 1.6k of that out and put it in your checking for bills, then spend the next 3 months studying.
Hey u/TGA25,

I'm sure there's not a trader here who hasn't had this feeling at one point in the trading life, one way or another. I have, and more than once to be honest with you. 

The feeling doesn't last, it isn't forever, but these types of instances are great ways to reflect on where you didn't perform well. 

What got me through was thinking about this rationally and how this would impact me over the course of my life. A loss isn't permanent, it just feels that way right now. 

If you think about your loss over your lifetime of another 50+ years, it's -700 a year, or equivalent to a couple of dollars/pounds/euros a day. Is that amount worth being depressed over?

From a practical perspective, personally I would scale back your trading activity, take a break. Revenge trading is real and is of no help to anyone. The markets will be there next week/month/increment of your choosing.

I'd take the time you aren't trading to figure out why those trades went against you, it's not wasted time then. You're choosing to improve and that's what's going to make you successful in the long run. 

Here to chat if needed,
You sound like me 4 years ago over a blown up 2k account...fast forward years later (it’s part of the journey)
You need to treat every new trade as a new trade being it’s own, not influenced by the past. As soon as you start making bigger revenge trades to break even is when you need to take a break. 

You need to sort out your psychology and start slowly building again. Have better risk management, protect your capital at all costs. If you lose a bunch in a row, cut your losses and take a break. 

This is a clear example of how a competent skilled trader can lose his edge if they get sloppy in the mind. 

It’s an expensive lesson but with persistence you’ll get it back. It will just take time. Be prepared.
22 years old?  Fuck it.  You're 22 years old.   If that's your biggest fuck up in life you're doing great.

Just learn from your loss.
Tell your self, you’re young and it’s ok to take risk at young age.  You got your entire life to easily catch up again
Not sure how you got $37k by 22 to begin with but that’s great. Don’t get down on yourself. Money comes and goes. Focus, study and maybe go with some low risk investments while you’re getting your confidence back. Don’t give up you’re doing great!
In March 2020, when Bitcoin was at $3,500, I could have bought ten coins. Had I done that, I'd be sitting on half a mil. Today, I'm on unemployment and just barely scraping by each month.
Learn from your bad trades and don't forget them, ever. You'll come to realize you KNOW when yoy shouldn't be doing something(poor size management, poor entry etc) but you'll do it anyways even tho you know it's not the best decision. I'm telling you when you realize that, DONT DO IT. Stick to what you think is rational, good entry proper size.
92% of the time, over a 20 year period the index fund will beat any day trader. 

Day trading is overcomplicated investing.
I too have made very expensive learning lessons. I still do. But I always try to look at the positive spin like at least I’m not in drugs or homeless. With bad investments I will hold on to them and take a break from it all. I’ll get more involved with family or work then after a month I’ll look back at it. There have been some investments that if I held on to them over 12 years I would have made out like a bandit. I feel for you and hope you find positives in your situation.
Here’s is a little story (you may have heard it before ) an employee at an organisation made a huge mistake and lost the company one million dollars he went to his employer and said I’m sorry I expect you will fire me. His boss said “why would I fire you I’ve just spent a million dollars on your training!

That’s how you should see this.  This a great and expensive lesson learned at a young age!  You’ve been knocked down and the only place to go from here is back up! So pick yourself up, dust yourself off and keep moving forward. Think about what you learned, put it into practice and one day you will look back and be thankful for what you learned because you will be more successful than ever.
I wish I started trading when I was young like you. $ lost is a gained experience. Stay strong and keep trying again.
I would read the book trading in the zone if you want to keep trading. 

You can trade. Just gotta get your mind right.  The market is just the market.  I don’t want to sound harsh, but you did this to yourself. Trading is a big responsibility.  Now that you understand that pain, you could level up in skill once you get over the grief of the losses. 

Never let em see you sweat.  You’ll get through it.  Hit the books, get smart.
First of all you will be all right! I know it’s seems like a lot, but you are going to survive. It sounds like you were chasing the market and cutting your losses way to much. Cutting losses makes sense sometimes but the market always rebounds as we began to see today. Don’t be afraid to hold a bag every now and then specifically when it means you won’t have to lock in large losses. When the market shits the bed.. just chill. It’s hard to be to be in the right place at the right time in the market.. but with alittle bit of time you end up in the right place.. meaning don’t chase. The last two months have been hell .. hext time just hold your positions unless it tanked for a company reason.. your position will rebound.
I think the majority of us have been there man, ive barely at the age of 25 have learned how to control my emotions and make better financial decisions, ive been doing this for 5 years already too.. You're ok bud, you can do better and you know now
That's like a year or two of tuition money (american tuition), but you probably learned way more in this experience than at a year at university
As others said just take some time off, don't think about stocks or anything ""heavy"", just relax, forget stocks exist, just try enjoying your life for a little bit. Then come back, sit down and make a plan.
You paid your ""stupid"" tax. Learn from your mistakes and rebuild. I lost $20k of my own money at age 18/19 (I saved up a lot of money and did tons of summer jobs since a preteen) by buying this stock and that stock without fully realizing what I was doing going almost balls deep into everything and doing no DD. Like you when I saw the losses rack up, I let my emotions get the best of me and sold at a loss to recoup whatever I could. Fortunately, my dad (who was a master at day trading and investing in my eyes who was able to retire at the age of 45 and currently lives off dividends equaling about $500k a year) realized I would fall due to my arrogance (I was a punk kid in my younger days) and was hoping I would make a move this dumb while still living at home with him and my mom being my safety net as opposed to me making this dumb of a decision when independent leaving me unable to pay rent, bills, necessities, etc.  I worked my ass off recouping the losses while my parents supported me with paying essentials when I needed like maybe a cell phone bill or two or if I needed help with making a payment on my tuition. 

Your 22, so I assume you either live at home with your parents still (or if your out in the world maybe consider moving back home). As a beginner, you should read and do research on what your exactly getting into and how much is at risk. With information so easily available now as opposed to when I tried to get rich overnight (I was 18 in 2006), you can come back and try again after building your confidence.

TLDR - I fucked up, hard, at a younger age than you. I'm sure others as well have here too. It's not the end of the world. Take a breather and see what went wrong and how it went wrong and learn from your mistakes and get back in the saddle when your good and ready. And ask you parents for help if you need it given your age.
What’s doesn’t kill you makes you stronger you’ll rise back from this only 22 buddy relax and embrace the experience
Sorry to hear about your losses man. You’re doing freakin awesome though from my perspective! If you’ve had the determination and work ethic to scratch that much money together to invest by your age I’m impressed. You learned an expensive lesson but the key is learning. Jon Maxwell says “you win some you learn some”. From over here if I heard of someone who’s done what you’ve done by your age all I can think is you are going to be very successful and have a lot of money. You can always earn more money, the good thing is you lost it early and you’ve got lots of time to earn more and change you’re investing strategies. Chin up man! You’re going to be ok! I know it feel like a kick in the gut now but someday it will be just a small part of your success story.
It's tough but learn from it, if you stick with stocks, or don't, either way you will become stronger.
Your young, better to have learned that lesson now than later. I'm 37 and still learning this stock market shit, wish I started as early as you
Good luck, you got this, stay strong
a lot has been said about education etc... i went through something similar but certainly less of magnitude as yours and still learning and i just like to offer something else about learning - trading is a game of psychology not really solely on charts and news. there's a lot of smoke and mirrors around but if you study humans, you get strong causational factors than what the world is trying to convince you from the trading arena. more importantly, learning is only true when you change or course-correct, if nothing changes, then there's no learning.

we're all humans and there's always emotions involved, that's natural. know that there're over 700 people here to support you as a community. fight back, keep asking and i'm sure you'll get back on your feet again! sharing with you this [tool](https://app.sparticus.xyz) that helps me a lot in my trading.
Hey bro keep your head up and try to not be so emotional. This is the biggest flaw in trading if you trade emotionally you will lose. It's good to get your dd from redit and YouTube etc.. but you need to make sure that you are verifying everything on your own before you make a decision. Also starting with such a high amount is dangerous, you should have started with a small account and slowly add as you learn, this is like driving Hayabusa when you don't even know how the gears work. You are officially at the amount that you should have started with take it slow. Here are a few things I've learned I hope they help: earning big isn't the goal, the goal is to simply earn. Shorting is more riskier that than buying. Leverage isn't always good, you have to pay it back at some point. Cash accounts help you manage your money easier. If you buy and you go red don't sell just hold, if you have the cash average down break even and get it before it's too late. And finally get a journal and right your thoughts down, looking back on it you will be able to track and see where you make analytical mistakes vs emotional ones. Good luck my friend.
Lessons not learned in blood are soon forgotten
Kid you're only 22, plus you have $2,600 to trade with. That's actually a good thing. Plenty of traders have blown up their accounts, and then turned things around.

   

***What To Do When You Blow Up Your Trading Account***

*I received a very touching email from a follower, Michael (name changed):*

*“First, thank you very much for your website. I lost my whole account trading the E-mini Futures. I’m so upset. I don’t know how I should start again. Please, can you help?”*

*Rather than send Michael a quick response, I thought I might spend some time writing a considered reply and publish it on E-mini-Watch. So here goes.*

*Michael, I would suggest you do three things:*

1. *Ask yourself whether trading really is for you and be brutally honest in your answer*
2. *If trading is for you, then go back through every one of your trades and figure out your mistakes*
3. *Then start again, but “paper trading” only and focusing on fixing your repeat mistakes*

*You’d be surprised how many emails I get from people who have just lost their job, scraped together $5,000 and want to make a living trading. Or attended a trading seminar showing how easy it is to trade. Or just want to buy a high profit mechanical trading system, and auto-trade it to incredible riches.*

*These people have no idea what they’re getting themselves into – they are “cannon fodder” for the Professionals. Michael, if you fall into this category and don’t have the stamina to succeed as a trader, then walk away – there are easier ways to make a living, trust me.*

*In my opinion two things separate the Professional Trader from the herd. Firstly, being able to override your instincts and wait until you get a high probability setup. Then follow a rules based trading plan. You need to plan your trades, and know when to close a trade when you are wrong.*

*Secondly, being consistent – day after day, month after month – making small gains every day rather than big wins followed by big losses. Approaching trading like a business – methodical, logical, dedicated.*

*So, what kind of trader are you? Is trading really for you or would you be happier focusing your energies somewhere else?*
If you are lucky you will get to have several more losses in a lifetime! Hopefully stack a win here and there to get you on the plus side! At 22, absolutely don’t worry! -Chip and a chair!
Yo 31yo right here and been trading in the red for 2 years now. Suffer from severe clinical depression and anxiety my whole life. Now an adult, medicated, and a leg up knowledge wise and still trading red, but my charts no longer resemble a jagged mountain range. Might be down $200 overall (and yes I know that's not comparable to 2k) but I'm still standing strong, still eager to learn, and looking forward to seeing my account back in green thanks to hard work. Don't give up, nothing in this world worth having comes easy. You can bounce back if you have the courage to better yourself
Did the same thing myself but with only a few hundred dollars which is a lot for me. It especially sucks when everyone around you is like ""told you so, the stock market is gambling"". Took me a few weeks for the whole incident to stop plaguing my mind every second of the day. I haven't given up though and will be trying again because the upside that comes with learning to be a good trader is limitless. All you really need is one good strategy that you can rinse and repeat as well as good risk management to make sure you don't lose everything. Sounds easy but I haven't been able to do it yet and a lot of people give up trying. Good luck!
Lol bro losing 52k is nothing man... I know how you feel. As if the whole world as ended, there is no way you’ll ever get back to 37k let alone 57k. But there is, you just have to sit down and understand what you did so you don’t repeat your mistakes. I had made my initial investment of 10k at 20 years old into 130k by the age of 23. Lost it all, Im 29 now and have more then I’ve ever had before.
Thank you for your donation
First of all take some time off from trading to get your mindset back on track. Second of all congrats: its a rite of passage I don't know any successful trader that has not burned an account or two (myself included) or that didn't at least get very close. I recommend you read the Market Wizards books (interviews with successful traders institutional as well as retail) that should inspire you and also you will probably realise that as I said these kind of things are part of the learning curve and if you continue to put in the work and learn from your mistakes you will become consistently profitable eventually.
I feel yea, I started at 4K in January got up to 106k at the end of February and now I’m at 289$.

Shits rough
I started from zero at least two times in my life. It just teaches you to be resilient . And I was happy to see my daughter lose money early in the game of investing.
Hey, take it as a challenge! Grow it back to 30-50K, but not right away. Study trading on YouTube, read books, etc for a week or two, then come back refreshed and renowned and try something different. I like the way this guy is trading: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRM3BIH11a8&t=851s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRM3BIH11a8&t=851s) 

He started from 25K and almost doubled it less than in 4 months. When you di it, you will feel very confident in yourself.
Reminds me of how I lost about 10k in a similar way. Worst thing is that I would have made at least double by not doing anything. I went through depression and even thought about suicide at some point. Still my stubborn ass didn’t give up and I am still trying to get better on demo. 

I figured out that trading is not really a tool for financial freedom. It’s rather a conduit that might help you achieve it. If you work hard, diversify your income, reinvest, and trade small you will get that in no time. It is more about diversifying your chances of getting money than putting it all into one thing. I hope the best for you and keep your head high. As It was said in Forest Gump. Shit happens. So duel whatever you have to duel and get back to the pilot seat cause you got some work to do to recover and thrive!
So I started trading around the same time. I signed up for a program that replays entire trading days so you can see how you really would have done on that day. It got me comfortable with trading large sums of money for small payouts. (I signed up for the program after some initial losses in the real stock market). 

I came up with a strategy that I know is specifically not recommended. It’s foolish, and a pretty shitty risk to reward ratio. Anyone who would see it would think I’m an idiot. I think I’m an idiot. 

I had a few losses in the beginning, but I’ve had almost 40 straight wins without a loss. 

The most important requirement is to trade in a volatile stock. 

I begin buying about 25 shares of a stock, sometimes worth up to 175 per share. And all I’m betting on is that it goes up a dollar. Then I immediately cash out. If the stock goes down, I just buy another 25 shares. Goes down again? Another 25 shares. Down again? Another 25 shares. 

Sometimes I just wait for it it to hit the Dip, and buy some more there, all with then intent of bringing my average cost per share down with the dropping price so I can sell 50 cents to a dollar above my average buy price. 

At one point, I’ll start to get scared that it will just keep going down, so I place my limit sell at something like 30 cents above my average, a ridiculously low reward to risk ratio. 

But it does make it significantly easier to cash out. But those 30 cents end up being my biggest wins, ranging from $250 to $400 per trade because I have so many shares at that point. But he’ll, I’ll settle for a $30 win. 

I’ve been in it 78k before a cashing out for $400. Terrible ratio. Stupid risk. But I don’t think I’ll learn my lesson until I experience a dip so drastic that the stock never bounces. I’ve had to leave it overnight on a couple of occasions, but it’s always worked out. 

I don’t need to know anything about the company. I don’t need to do heavy analysis. I just need to see if there is a general trend up or down. I need to make sure it’s consistently fluctuating between 2-3 dollars. And of course, you need enough cash to follow the price downward if necessary. 

On most trades, im in and out in less than a couple of minutes. 

My number one rule, and to which I largely attribute my success, is to not be greedy. Every time I’ve sold, the stock always rises higher than what I sold it for. But I don’t see that as a lost opportunity. I see that as insurance. 

My goal isn’t to sell at the peak to maximize my return. My goal is simply to have a return. Any return. 

I would consider selling at 1 cent above buy price a win, no matter how much money I have in it, because a win allows me to trade another day. 

I also set my goals fairly low. I’ve had $40 days and $800 days. But except for those initial losses, I never end up in the red.

I almost forgot. There have been times when I run out of cash before the sock is done plumetting. What I’ll do is just start another game with myself buying and selling at 10 cent or 25 cents above buying price, sometimes as little as 5 cents just to keep buying at a lower price and bringing my cost average down. 

It’s an ugly strategy. No one would risk 50k or 60k just to get a $30 dollar return on a trade. But I will. 

I haven’t traded nowadays because I’ve put it all on ethereum. I did the math, and it would be very hard to beat the gains I expect to see in ethereum. And I haven’t been disappointed.
Try out thetagang and tastyworks. Selling options is much better strategy than timing the market or picking winners/losers.
37K at 22? 

You have no problems in life.
Learn to admit a mistake before it gets this bad again. You’re young enough to fuck up some more
Put the rest in IPOE and stop daytradjng. Just invest in great companies and do nothing
You are 22, your full life is ahead. As long as the loss is only monetary, and you learn from the mistake, you will come out stronger. Do not forget: if it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger
Same My Friend, I can tell you the Exact same timeline, Even started at the exact time and lost it in FEB,2020.

I did not know it all, I did not know what I do now, you still have an account, you are the 10% that did not blow their account the first year.

congrats, Hows it feel to have made it this far and still have an account? Remeber 90% Lose that account the first year...
Just head the Adam Smith quote: “the stock market is an expensive place to find out who you are”. This is not a personal comment. But it’s about who we are as people.

Please do yourself a favour and read The Behavioural Investor. I’m listening to the audio book right now and it’s really insightful.

Best of luck and I know you can pull yourself out of the rut you’re in!
lol. i had 100k now im down to 10k so
Youre 22, theres so much life- opportunity ahead of you. You could literally punt the next 18 years of your life and still only be 40! Not to mention having 2k is plenty more than most people out there have to start with. Take a break, try to do something completely different for a couple days, then chin up. Its a mindset game. Everyone blows up an account or 4 starting out
You got this.  Life is about learning from mistakes and moving on.  I will be cheering for you and your comeback!
Bro your young and you can always make that money back I’ve lost over 100k. Money comes and goes. You will have your up and downs. Don’t beat yourself up because of it
I did the same at the age of 20. I couldn‘t believe what I have done. I basically did every mistake that was possible. Adding to losses, ... . 

Many years later I‘m happy that I made that experience when I was young with just a few dollars. Otherwise I would have lost now much more. 

I‘m still investing but with low risk and mostly standing at the side and watching.
Definitely nowhere near as much money as you, but I had 16k (which is a LOT to me, red flag) and went down to $800. Now back to 4K currently, but that also includes deposits into the account.

I definitely understand your pain and depression dude. I spiraled hard afterwards. Maybe take a step away for a little. That helped me when I was freaking out. Step away for a bit. Don’t look at investing subs. Don’t look at any potential investments or do any DD. Just take a full stop, then come back to it with a clearer head.

Take care of yourself man, still very young too so you have nothing but time to bounce back, which you will definitely do.
Bro I just did the exact same thing, yolod everything and was hodling and managed to double it twice, sat there hypnotised for 18hours first time trading trying to double up again and lost everything, I felt as bad as a human could feel. I felt like at that point I had ruined my life and there was no possible way to get back. Didn't want to tell my family after they all thought I was doing so well. Told them anyway. The next day I noticed I still had $945 in a coin. I traded and doubled up, the next day I made about $500 the following day I lost $700. But I have found some hope that if I can figure out how to win trades and not try make gains to fast, there is still hope
Take some time off from trading actual money. There are tons of free videos on YouTube on charting, premarket scanner, on how to do due diligence, how to read Sec Filings etc. You can try different set up doing mental trade without risking money and by just observing any stock that is moving by looking at the volume, time and sales. Also look at videos on YouTube on how to use Finviz to help you find stock that could run. Get yourself a good broker and trading platform. There are a few that you can used for 90 days for paper trading to help you improve your skills. Once you comfortable with trading again, manage your risk, take emotion out of it. Once you are in profit on a stock, always take some profit with a minimum is take out what you put in. 70/30% or 80/20% base on your risk, take 70/80% once you hit your target profit, leaving 20/30% to see where it goes. The goal is to survive the 1st 3 years with minimum of loss or even with some profit as you learn and gain experience. I used a cash account to trade, no ptd rule. I personally do not short stock with a cash account I can not short sell. Short selling is the fastest way to wipe old your account if caught in a short squeeze. I would stay away from complex instruments. I trade mostly actually stocks. With options you will lose every dollar you used to buy the option if your price target was not reach and it ending up expire. Good luck
Mmm don’t get discouraged, but do slow down. Take very small steps to rebuild your confidence, primarily continue to learn as much as you can, every day. 

If you learn any single thing, and take that new wisdom to heart and mind then you have gained something money can not buy. 

Keep learning, keep trying, keep growing your skillset and judgement, and self control as a trader. There will come a point when your knowledge and practice can create wealth for you, from any account size no matter how small. Learning, confidence, building upon small successes. 

Then the profits will come, and there will be a day when you confidently blow right past your initial investment with ease, even starting with $100. Patience and persistence
Money is just a piece of paper with a number on it. You still live fine if you lose some of it. Money you can get back but time you can't get back so just find your passion and refocus on that.
You have two options the way I see it. Put the rest in stone index fund or YOLO the rest in some leaps. Assuming that you don't care if you lose the rest.
Keep your head up. Use what you’ve learned so far and you will be able to bring your money back up. Be sure to avoid impulsivity and trust your research. There are ups and downs, so don’t let your emotions make you sell at a lower price than you bought. It’s something we’ve all done and lost money to. Stay strong young trader 💪🏽 You’re not alone (I’m only 24, you might feel like you have less life ahead of you than you actually do. But remember we’re still pretty young)
Trading aint gambling. Learn humility and patience, then, you will make profits. Just being real.
Money comes and money goes... you are young and learned your lesson with an amount of money that will not ruin your life. The only thing to do now is to learn from your mistakes and not go balls deep in something you don't fully understand. I would stick to longer-term investment strategies. However, if you want to try your hand at day trading again I recommend starting with paper trading, using small amounts of money, and HAVE A PLAN TO EXIT WHEN YOU ARE DOWN OR UP!! don't trade on emotions and at the end of the day, your life matters more than a few numbers on a screen! :D
I recommend u automate ur strategy with algo, so ur emotions don't take part onto the decision making.
Success is when you don’t lose enthusiasm failure after failure. You got this! I blew up my accounts twice. I was depressed like you but then I chose to learn from my mistakes and move on. Risk management is everything in trading. Never underestimate your risk!!!
Sorry to hear this man.. bright side, you learned some big lessons for your age. Better now than being 36 with a wife and kids and playing around with the family savings and turning your marriage into a tense, shitty dynamic. Plenty of people have lost MUCH more. You're young and now you know how the market works (to an extent).. Consider it a lesson and keep climbing elsewhere.
Hey man, that really sucks. I am learning right now, and I am no expert, but there is one thing that I have picked up along the way that has really helped me get my head straight. 

The ONLY thing that you can completely control in trading is how much you lose. 

good luck bro
Back to pennystock you go thou is not worthy yet for big gains.
The good news is you are young. (I took some big losses recently breaking the rules and not cutting losses.)  Get How to make money in stocks by william j. Oneil ..goes with IBD.

Your not alone a lot of people got rektd end of feb! Me included but i took money out before that!
I had the same story when I was 26. I brought up my account from 2000€ to 70000€. That felt great. I also diversified, stayed away from daytrading and just bought stocks. Than I noticed that diversification is slowing down my growth and decided to go “all in” into a stock I totally believed in. It was a venture capitalist that held a lot of dot.com start investments and managed their IPOs with huge profits. So criteria were all there: diversified due to startup portfolio, exponential growth out of ipos, still “undervalued” as the sum of the portfolio was higher than the market value of the stock. 

Than the bubble crashed. My investment went from 70k to 5€. I was so pissed, that I didnt touch stocks for a long time (mistake) and didnt participate in the biggest bullmarket ever. Also I avoided amazon, facebook, apple, etc. 

Lessons learnt: get burnt, regret, heal, start small again. And manage greed ;)
I once lost 200k. You'll bounce back
Man...I’ve been exactly where you are so many times. I blew up account after account for 3 years straight. It got so bad I couldn’t even place a trade, I would literally shake every time I would enter a trade. Eventually, I got it, I never gave up and I continued to face my fear. If I would have given up I would never be where I am at today. Keep your head up, stay strong and stay in the game. Eventually, things come together. But don’t beat yourself up in the meantime. Most important thing I learned from all my experience, is position size, focus on the validity of the trade not the dollar amount and if the dollar amount bothers you, you have too big of a position. Reduce until you are comfortable and able weather the market if your trade doesn’t turn out as you planned. Watch your position, watch your emotions and focus on the trade itself. Paper trade until your confidence comes back. Find your niche in the market and master it. Just keep growing and take it easy on yourself.
You have plenty of time to recover and make more money.

Professional trading is very difficult. Not only do you need to be profitable, you need an income. That is much harder than simply turning a profit. 

I would slow down and make very small trades you’re very confident about. Don’t focus on the profit in dollars, just the % gain or loss. Prove that you have strategies that work, or find out which don’t. 

I keep a log of trades. Why did I buy?  What am I expecting to happen?  Stop loss?  Target?  Results.
Dude, I understand your suffering, I myself lost all my money after persistent training on a demo account for 1.5 years, I was successful, but the market changed, and I could not survive with a small account. Unfortunately, the reality is that you can't make money all the time. You just need to learn how to keep balance. Don't be discouraged. I've also lost all my money and don't even have a job. I do not know when I will return to the game now. Lousy too, but hold on.
INVEST INTO DIVIDENDS AND FORGET ABOUT IT FOR A GOOD YEAR OR TWO
At 22 I was snorting crushed up pills of a cistern at the pub and betting my last 100 on black every weekend. In 32 now and just made my first million over the last few months. Starting at 22 you’ll be fine I had hardly anything less than 50k up until I was about 25. Get back up and take a more serious shot at investing rather than speculating you’ll be fine. Also I blew my first account and life savings 25k trading 500x leverages forex after watching Amy Sangster videos on YouTube lol.
its okay man! Seriously, don't be hard on yourself. you're so young. We all pay our tuition fees as they say. Don't chase your gains back, analyze where you went wrong, and slowly but surely you will build back to that point. Most importantly, remember to stay grounded- you have a roof over your head, food and water, internet, spring is here, and more bull markets to come. Health is wealth, listen to Buffet or the likes, they all say that health is the most important thing in the long run esp at their age. A wise man learns from suffering, and therefore transforms it into a positive experience. Go over to WSB and laugh at the -$200k loss porn with everyone.
Please research MONEY MANAGEMENT
You really need to learn about trading psychology because this is textbook emotional reactivity.     
I think one of the most useful things I’ve learned in my journey so far is about how we perceive it all as we go along, and how staying ahead of your emotions is vital.     

Really sorry for your losses
Now you have an advantage you'll be able to write off those losses for years
Stock market is always gonna be there. Better to learn this lesson at 22 than 62. I lost a lot at first until I settled down and started making better decisions. Consider it tuition, sit back and analyze your mistakes, what went wrong, why you did what you did and what lead to that decision. Then avoid those mistakes by making better decisions. You’ll still make mistakes and the market will still do unexpected things, but hopefully less than before and you start seeing a profit.  Don’t try to make the money back quickly, it won’t work.  Analyze, regroup and make non-emotional decisions. If you can’t do that I suggest picking a couple ETF’s to stash your money in and walk away.
I am sorry for your loss.

Have you calculated what your initial investment would be worth today if you hadn't started day trading? I mean if you put the money into the original set of stocks and held until now. Would you still be in the same situation?
Wew, only 30k? Marriage costs way more, just mentally deduct it from that. But also, focus on the future. You will have at least learned one important lesson: only gamble with what you can afford to lose. Emotions or finance.

Most people pay a heavier price than that to learn that lesson. Accept the pain, learn from the mistake and move on. No need to keep punishing yourself. Be glad it wasnt 60k, a million or losing two children to a car crash in spite of expecting them to outlive you. Life has a harsh way of teaching. At least you’re still alive, so continue living good sir!
Investing is a marathon, not a sprint! Remember that and plan to invest in something for the long term. 1 to 2 months and you got out?! Thise losses only mean something if you sell!!! Hey, that's just being young and immature... don't let the past control your now, bud. It can't hurt to seek advice! Many financial advisors only charge like 1%. Although they're not going to advise any of the meme stonks, many can't! I know Raymond James doesn't allow crypto trading, which imo, will continue to go up (the bigger ones). 

I lost a bunch on pot stocks a few years ago and still have them to this day, I'm ready to die with those. It's good to put in what you can live without. 

It's amazing the amount of people putting all their eggs in one or two baskets. Etf's can be a good way to start diversifying your portfolio.
Good thing is you are very young. Learn from this!! Use better risk management next time and remember this is not a get rich quick thing. Invest over time
When I started I did something similiar. 40k to 80k and than I went HEAVY with low DD and got caught with my pants down... The 80k went to 25k in no time... But I held strong and slowly as positions got green I would close them out, and buy more of the other positions.. It took about 9 months, but eventually they all went back to green. 

The biggest takeaway is sizing... previously I would go all in and hope that was the best price...Today I will buy in chunks. I just did this the other day with AMC. 

&#x200B;

AMC was at $10 and I had 30k to play with that day. Instead of buying 3,00 shares I bought 500. Price went down 20 cents and I picked up 1k, and it dipped again to 9.20 and than I dropped rest of my bag. This wound up getting my cost average down by almost 50 cents!!! My cost avg is 9.58 and I have 3130 shares instead of 3k @$10... I could even hold that extra 130 shares after I take my profits and let them ""bake""....
Hey man, I've been there and can identify with the pain/shame.  When this happen to me, it actually put me in a better place once I got a hold of my emotions.  How did loosing a a shit ton of money put me in a better place?  It forced me to stop being reckless.  I stopped the yolo quick buck BS.  I stopped chasing hype.  I learned how to use screeners/scanners.  I learned how important float size is and how volume can dramatically change price action.  I learned to how to calculate short interest.  I put more focus on reading historical charts and looking at technical indicators like RSI, MCAD, and moving averages.  This are pretty basic things, that I completely neglected to put weight on.  Once I was able to semi put that together, I started trading SMALL.  Once, I started doing that and making a little money $2 - $10 I realized I was missing something else.  An exit strategy!  I realized that the odds of me being able to time the market perfectly were not going to happen.  I started exiting my trades earlier.  Sure I left money on the table, but I made money more often than loosing money.  That is the game.  Forget what you left on the table after your exit.  Green is good. Green builds confidence.  You'll get back where you were, man.   Have faith in yourself, buddy.
I know how that feels like, the same thing happened with me where I lost an unreasonable amount due to silly leveraging. 

I lost 20k but now I have 100k invested and had I not lost the first 20k, I’m sure I would’ve jeopardized my current portfolio. 

You’ll have more money in the future than you have now. 
How to deal with it? Have a plan, start slow, don’t make hasty decisions and you’ll eventually come back up. 

When you made money, someone lost money on the other end of the trade. Now it’s your turn
I get a really uncomfortable horrible emotional feeling when things go crazy downhill - sort of like “this always fucking happens to me!” and “great just when I get in this fucking happens!”. I’m probably one of the few assholes that lost money on the TSLA run.... but doing that made me not chase GME. 

I’ve also seen huge gains wiped out and second guessed not selling while it was higher. I’ve day traded but am not a day trader per se. But here’s how I’ve learned and approach the market now:

1) I have a few holding that I will stick with long term pretty much no matter what. You guessed it, these are rockstar ETFs. They’re not going to give me mega returns but these bad boys will very likely be steady over the course of many years. 
2) I hold a few mega cap stocks that are solid. Yes, FB, AAPL, MSFT, etc.
3) I have a soft percentage amount I assigned to 1 and 2, around x% will be invested there. 
4) the rest I assigned to risky plays - ROKU, MGNI, PLUG, DKNG, SPACs and
5) options - I don’t have the emotional fortitude to risk / yolo on options. But if I can set aside some money and come terms that I’m willing to lose it all it makes much more palatable.

Pre Feb dip I was up huge on warrants, SPACs, and options, all of that went to shit. I sold many at a loss, slowly trimming and eventually exiting positions, I also sold some of the stronger picks to offset some of the losses. So I took money off the table. Overall still green but lost over 80K in potential profits.

It’s a fact - we all have different connections and reactions to money. Don’t deny that. I know ppl who will never invest in stocks on their own and I know gamblers and I know ppl who will take 8% YOY over possible 500% return. It’s ok to be none of those or something else entirely. If the way you’re trading is causing emotional distress as it was for me, then reevaluate and change.
You still have one thing that is the most important to any portfolio - TIME. You are 22 and at your age you are supposed to take risks because you perceivably have more time to recover on losses. It is only through failure that we learn some of life’s more valuable lessons. It’s been rough on all of us small investors but you are still in the game.
This is typical for daytraders. I've been trading on an off since the mid 1990s.. I've made and  lost many accounts. 

Short term trading has about the same returns at gambling. When it works, you're a genius... but then it stops working

But its fun.. and that's why we do it.. but what you wrote above is the normal pattern. And it will happen again. Its gambling.
I lost 2/3rds of my trading account when I started shorting in December. 20k in losses. It’s gonna suck really hard for like 2 weeks, and then it’s gonna get better. I viewed my blow out as a learning experience as I didn’t obey my stop loss and exit strategies. $CRIS. ;( now I’m working on being a bull and trying to build up a new account.
For what it's worth bud..

Money isn't shit unless it brings you something that lasts. Extract the seed of ""learning"" from this event and your money was spent on value (yes expensive) but REAL VALUE none-the-less.

Seriously, you are YOUNG and even though it seems like it now... I PROMISE YOU in the grand Scheme of Things that amount of money was NOTHING!

You're smart for reflecting back like this and being honest with yourself, I can tell you have what it takes (as long as you apply discipline) to be successful at whatever you want to do. If trading is still something you want to do then embrace reading and learning and keep on keeping on, you still have over $2k and you could turn this around with some patience, discipline and controlling your mind and emotions.

I took a $30k+ loss in 2017 that I NEVER THOUGHT I would bounce back from (financially or mentally).. I did. So can you brother!
You’re 22. Come on man.
I’m in almost the same boat. Been trading for a few years and started high risk investments early in the pandemic. Everything went great, turned 30k > 80k and then rode it back down in September / October to about 15k. 

Recovered to 40k and lost all that again and more in February / March. 

I need a break and I think that’s healthy. I have mostly just safe investments right now being held. 

Need to re-evaluate my strategy and how I’m willing to mitigate risk. Also need to cool off and be okay “not being in the game”. If I had just sat out for the last month, I’d be probably 30k richer.
Hey bro, we have all been there.  My father had $1.5M in a 401k that dropped to $15K in about a month due to risky bets just prior to the market crash.  I warned him and warned him.... now I support him in his retirement.... life is tough, but just remember your health is the best investment you can really have... 

Also, consider that it's just money.  Money comes and goes ... I know about that weight you talk about.... Having made decisions on who lives and who dies is similar.  I made some of those over the last few decades in combat and Without going into details, I had to make the call on who got a MEDEVAC bird and who had to self-EVAC during critical massive operations... who gets close air support and who gets nothing... who gets a reaper and who gets the shit mission into a one-way valley know for mega-IEDs.... this was daily during the fighting season... now it keeps me up almost ever night, when I ask myself... did I do everything I could... I think so, but I will never know so.
Luckily you’re young. You’ll get it back. Listen to all the stories of great investors who have been through the same thing. Learn from your mistakes.
You’re still only 22, my dude. Most of your peers have $0 in their trading account.  Sucks about the $30k, but you’re still in a good spot. Now you know a little better though.  Keep building that account up, but maybe try to buy and hold and take advantage of the fact you have decades ahead of you to let your stocks grow.  If you want to grow your account quicker in the short term, I’d recommend a side hustle or something that helps you deposit more funds.
First off, like many others have said. You're young, and can recover from this. I'd suggest take a long break from trading at least a month to let the mind relax and put it into perspective. Then would highly suggest reading up on money management of trading and learning to stick to set risk, a strict daily loss limit etc. And ditch the habit of overleveraging by averaging down a losing trade, or doubling down, the sooner the better. While on break or until you venture again on trading. Some links that may be helpful to read or put into perspective. gl.

A few old threads on elitetrader on losses ([1](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/what-is-the-worst-one-day-loss-you-ever-had.74408/), [2](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/ive-lost-400k-the-last-2-months-im-quitting.71919/))

([""Appreciating the Risk of Ruin""](http://m.cdn.blog.hu/vi/vilagbagoly/nonimage/risk_of_ruin_2.pdf))
I lost 140k last year on Intel call options right when they tanked hard on poor outlooks for their fabs. (i sometime summer/fall of last year)

I've never made 140k in my life doing any sort of job, I didn't tell my wife we were broke, I just made up excuses or dodged her inquiries about like, buying something nice.   Over the next 6 months I turned the 5k-ish I had left into about 84k.   It was hard and painful, and mentally straining but i'm glad I learned the hard way.   I became much more disciplined and hardened with stop losses, managing risk and really thinking things through before pulling the trigger on anything.  I'm 38, and I recovered pretty quickly although i still have some ways to go to make up for the loss.  You're 22, you'll be alright.
You’re fine honey, please don’t beat yourself up for it. With 2.6k you’ll grow that into 100k and you’ll remember when you lost that 50k and maybe you’ll even think “I’d have 150k right now if it weren’t for that time..” but when that time comes remember that your hardship, your adversity, your climb from 2k to 100k+ made you mentally stronger and resilient. And that vindication can’t be bought. Whatever you make from now on has a story behind it. When you tell people in the future you have X amount of money you remember to tell them that you lost 50k at one point and raised it all up again. That’s success. Learning from your mistakes.
We all lose money. It’s the cost of playing the game. Rub some dirt on it and get back in. Just remember to trade without emotion. You’re trying to be green. Not trying to win back losses. If you’re making decisions while looking at your losses then you should take a break from trading.
As for the depression I would suggest going offline for a week or so and detox the toxicity that comes from all social media.  Spend time with friends and family and remind yourself of the things that are truly important in life beyond the internet and money.  If you start thinking anything really dark look for pro help right away.

As for investing I would suggest going back to basics, use a SIM to test your strategy and test your ability to stick to the strategy.  Once you can see consistent results using your plan you go back to the real deal and work on recovering one day at a time.

Remember you're not alone and many people are in the same spot you are in right now. Learn from your mistakes and move forward learning from these mistakes.
Listen to big bro that was your age near the bottom. I graduated high school in 2007. I’ve noticed so much overconfidence from people in your generation and that got the best of you. You put way too much in for someone with your amount of knowledge and than the gambling brain chemicals whooped your ass too. The good news is that you are only 22. Your will continue to receive get kicked around until you learn. On the upside, you made it through what so many in your generation will undoubtably go through at some point.  Some of your peers will refuse to believe in a bull market because they have never lived through it but you will live to see them lose everything a couple weeks after you pulled out because after losing so much at one time you learned to be cautious. As far as making your money back, put would you have left into a diversified group of etfs (don’t forget bonds) let someone else do the heavy lifting for you. Pay attention to how the market effects your holdings. Balance and diversity is key. Watch how the “economic” weather effects the value of these holdings and read everything you can. You will come up from your low. At 22 I didn’t see myself as “just a kid” but give yourself a break, your still just a kid. Failure is how we learn.
First thing is anyone who would rub it in is not worth reading/listening to.  Ignore the trolls.  Next, you have the fortune of having some wise grandmas (internet strangers at that) , giving you words of wisdom.  Looking at the replies here, a lot of people took the time to post positive messages.  This is the best of reddit right here!

You are so far ahead of the average 22 year old that you could be described as having an ""unfair advantage"", and of course I'm joking slightly, but really, 37K at age 22 is really impressive.

I don't know what your current job is, but taking a break, de-stressing, and focusing on saving, you could have your account funded back up to a decent level quite soon.  Whatever you do, don't blow the remaining funds on high risk trades.  If you can stomach smaller size trades, e.g. you were trading 1,000 shares of a 27 USD stock, now trade 100 shares, then that is what I would do, however your best bet is probably a break to recuperate and get your head back in the game.
We all have our bad patches brother. More power to you!
learn when it is time to stop.

I lost more than 30,000 USD in trading bitcoin and other crypto.

Realized that it is not for me and the sharks are too big for me to achieve anything. Before i could lose anymore, I quit and started investing.

Grown my money from 10,000 USD to 100k. peace of mind.
Dude it happens. You learn nothing in life from winning.  Examine your failures, minimize your victories (but be grateful for them).  If you do this, you'll be an amazing person at the end.  And probably pretty successful, to boot.
Brah, I took a 40k penalty today for pulling out of a trading contract today so I know the pain your feeling. I drink when I am happy and eat ice cream on real bad days. I had a huge hot fudge sundae today. I am a beginning day trader also. But I trade in crypto. The volatility is how I make money not from skills. I have about the same account as you in my learning account. You could begin to build your account back and your self esteem. You can make it back.
Take your losses, buck up. Whining about it won't bring it back. Educate yourself on day trading. I started the same time you did and I'm down also after a great start. But I started very slow with no large money. Everytime I saw a red candle on the chart I found myself second guessing myself. It really takes time to build confidence. No one, and I mean NO ONE is always a winner. Don't beat yourself up take that energy and find solutions.. you'll be ok.
All the opportunity cost and regret hurts no doubt, but if you already had 37k at the age of 22 you must have something good going on for yourself, otherwise idk how you managed that. When I was 22 I was happy if my account even had a comma in it. I’d suggest taking a break from investing for awhile, then if you decide you want to start again go for very low risk trades, and gradually increase your risk if you’re successful.

Be grateful. You still have: health, wealth & youth
Listen to (young) grandma here. I am in my 50's. It has taken years to get myself straight financially. Divorce, bad decisions, etc. You are very young. Most people your age don't have $500 to their name, much less a couple of thousand. It sucks, take the L and learn. Also, don't go for fast money. High reward ONLY comes from high risk. Ask me how I know... It might feel like you're done, but you are just beginning!
Many people make $50,000 mistakes. Divorce, drunk driving, criminal offenses. You lost some money. You still have your good name and your only 22. This will pass. There is no making up your losses. You may be able to learn to make future profits. You might be better off in etfs. Dollar cost average for the long term. You have hopefully many years to recoup your losses. I'm sick from losses this month too. $30g. Keep your head up and take this a the cost of financial education. Learn about limiting loss. Good luck. Stay positive anyway. At least you can still choose to be happy. Or you can be sad and broke it's a choice.
I sent you the last award I could afford because of the level of wisdom this contains, to make this post more visible to those who need to hear it. Your self worth is determined by your own ability to live yourself. Nothing more, nothing less. Your children and grandchildren are lucky to have you in their lives, as everyone needs a teacher. That being said, I feel the need to remind you (probably unnecessarily) that they have things to teach you as well. As Frank Zappa said, ""a mind is like a parachute, in that it only works if it is open"".
Bets comment ever! Education is expensive. I will remember that!
50 years old man.  Listen to her she knows.  Ive lost 10 times that in bad business.  You need to risk it to make it.  Learn... do better.
TandTice - Wise words. Equally, have had a lot of cash and also only $80 in a checking account with 4 additional mouths to feed. Money is a means, not and end!

man i am saving this post. I will keep this advice man until I need it.
The thing is he probably never learned
Advice, the first time you double your money, so for you it would’ve been at 16k, pull back your original investment so you’re playing with house money. At the very worst at that point you have a net of 0
If you 4x your investment and don’t liquidate enough to cover your cost basis....I don’t know what to say. 

My condolences and I hope you make better decisions in the future.
How did you get it up to 32k in such a short amount of time?
This is my situation exactly same amounts too
How does one pay taxes when that happens?  You retire xxK gains and then its all gone but you still have to pay taxes for your initial gains
Appreciate you. Should I trade options now that my capital is small ?
I'm so sorry for your loss.
When people say it’s “just money” it’s just to help the person feelings 
No different than if the individual who lost the money said that statement it’s just a “cope”
perhaps instead of forex you should look into futures (micros maybe) and possibly cash-settled-options aka index options if you like daytrading options. in addition both of these get 60/40 tax treatment, and futures aren't subject to PDT concerns as they aren't securities, but i think index options are, so PDT applies to them.
Guys I was in a similar position before. I took a different approach.. I went to educate myself, graduated economics and went to work on wallstreet with the aim of getting back to market with more knowledge and more skills.

Couple of years later, I have found out that most of the  big time IB traders didn’t actively trade their own money as much and oftentimes viewed their services as a utility rather than a means of making huge amounts of money in a short amount of time (yes, many will say that IB trading is different to that in HFs but the HFs go bust every quarter and big banks... well they don’t. One of the reasons for it is less apetite for risk).

Myself, I stood at a choice of either pursuing my career further and treating trading as a side thing, a way to make some extra money or... quiting my job and utilizing my skills in the market 100%.

I decided the former. I am much happier now when I treat trading as a hobby, I’m also much less inclined to take unnecessary risks because I know I have the positive pnl every month from my salary.  

It’s a strategy I can fully recommend guys, it takes time, I know but I assure you it’s worth it in the long run. Keep educating yourself and get to know the market as it’s, in my opinion, a neccessary tool for survival in the world nowadays. 

But I would be careful about treating solo trading as a long term career... remember, there are many, many people on internet that will try to scam you into their „lambo in 10 months” day trading strategies but always take it with a grain of salt.. take into account all the risks, realistically and objectively evaluate your chances of success.

That’s what I am doing and myself I don’t see many clear „opportunities” in the market. Some will say it’s a bad thing because „opportunites lie everywhere”, some will say „I just can’t look for them”. For me it’s just risk management, I know what’s my risk appetite, I have learned how easy it is for me to lose large sums of money in the market and I know how long I need to work for to regain this money in the real world. 

I won’t tell you that „money is just money”, maybe because I’m still in my twenties. But I will tell you that, oftentimes, „money = time”. 

So be wise about how you spend your time, treat it with respect, because time is the most valuable and the most incredible thing we possess. 

With enough time and dedication you can get back any money you lose. Just learn from your actions and tbh... remember daytrading isn’t as sweet as many make it to be. There is a good reason for why many finance professionals don’t actively trade in the market. Many prefer much more conservative investment strategies with much less risk exposure than „putting your money to work” based on technicals and stuff some internet gurus funnel to the public for youtube views money.

Stay strong, think of the longterm and what the guy said, don’t tell your friends and family about the lossess, that’s your burden now, suck it up, forget about it and move on. That’s what worked for me.
Well said grasshopper. You have learned a lot at age 25. Happy for you to gain wisdom at an early age. Much better to master the skills and discipline of risk management earlier rather than later. Speaking from experience, had I done that I would have saved millions.
Along the lines of strategy and instrument, for anyone interested, I'm learning to scalp the ES futures using a 2000 tick chart. Going well so far in sim. There are a few basic set-ups and I maybe take 3 trades a day tops being very picky, but feel confident that with more screen time I'll be able to be consistently profitable.

I use Ninja Trader, $500 required for one contract, each contract $50 a point with 4 ticks per point. I only scalp for one point. 

The ES is awesome because it's 1. incredibly liquid 2. prints pretty consistent price action 3. no pdt. 

The setups I take (2nd entry long/ short, failed 2nd entry long/ short aka traps, and lower high/ higher low) are based off of PATS trading method - he does chart reviews on YouTube every day and posts trade examples. His manual is so-so. Day One Traders, based off of PATS, also on YouTube,  got me started and their course was really helpful, kinda pricey though. S0lzz on YouTube posts awesome daily trade footage, ByebyeMoney also has solid content. I'm in the PATS discord, cool community/ good resource while trading.

Anyway, highly highly recommend scalping ES using the 2000 tick and 2el, 2es, f2el, f2es, hl, lh setups. Pretty straight forward, hardest part is being patient and picky.
Since you mention about the forex. i just wan to ask you regarding to it. is it easier than trading the regular stock?
Can I dm you also? I’m in a similar position
Dude neither of you should be trading, you are just gambling.
If you have debt and money, pay the debt no matter what. Interests on debt will eat up your profits and accumulate over time.
Can you be me mentor
That's the trader I was. I was good at choosing tickers but when the stock go up I wasn't educated enough to take my profits and go and vice versa, greed also. Those made of me a bag holder. Obv the market now isn't for swing trading which sucks having to scalp with my small capital without confidence the 20 bucks now means something in my account so can't risk shit
I’m another person who started with too much money and too little knowledge, and tried to put way too much into one position at a time because I thought it would keep going up and I’d double my money the way I did the first or second time I got lucky. You really just have to take the massive losses as a learning experience to motivate you to get better and learn more.

And so far I’ve finally started making it back in a satisfying and more consistent way by just selling all the bricks I was holding to accept the loss, and use the capital on much safer and smaller swing trades. Now understanding the “game” better from both research and experience. Of course there’s still so much I don’t know, and I’m far from ready to touch options. But it feels good to make back even small amounts when it finally feels like you have noticeably improved your tactics.
Thanks man. It feels definitely harder trading now since I had the luxury of large capital which generates small profits conveniently, Shame I'm just appreciating those just now. Market really humbled my ASS.
a promising stock? He just made 50k disappear in 2 months.
Yeah if he is down to $2.6k and isn't bag holding anything that means he kept trading and cutting his money down to $2.6k, which is depressing. It feels like you're always losing. The thing to thing about is that if you are trading in a down market you are going to keep losing. But obviously he built it up to $50k in the bullish time frame. He is going to have to wait for that time again because you can't force trades in the down market.
Head over to r/superstonk 

Put it in GME and you will be worth circa $2.4bn within a few months

Thanks for sharing appreciate you
Was this back in 08-09? Housing market has been printing cash the last decade and even more so the last 18 months...
How do you manage to lose money in real estate? Mind sharing? 

I’ve always been under the impression that if you buy in a good area and hold you will always be ok
You are an inspiration
Definitely. Risk management is above all. I'll make sure I don't blow up again. Holding overnight the past weeks fucked me in this market. Thank you
Forgot to mention
Greed is a beast
There is never enough
When you start thinking you're hot shit again
Humbled yourself
Exactly, when I was in this losing streak I took time off trading to learn more and become a better trader. This is not going to solve everything but it is going to empower you to make better decisions. Take time off to reoup your thoughts, take some classes, and start again, it is possible. Wait for things to get bullish again. Or continue watching the market for the bullish stocks only.
Glad somebody asked it, I hate these posts though so I’m biased.
This means a lot man. It's unbelievable what It can do to you mentally. You're right in taking a break seems I'm not able to daytrade clearly at my condition
Thanks man:)
Sorry, how do you know you're a good trader with losing so much money. Or is that like 5% of your portfolio. It sounds like something a bad trader with a terrible risk management would go through.
That’s nice. What about. 100k? 400 a day is excellent. That’s 0.4% per day. 

Those kinds of equity moves are predictable, since most major companies move more than 1% a day in terms of range. 

But direction is the key. 

People have taken $10000 to more than 5 million into two years. It’s possible. Easy, even. A mouse click to accept a contract takes less than 5 calories, you just need to be correct. 

People have made 5 more than 5% a week compounding. 

0.4% daily growth is excellent. Sure. Just requires a quality strategy.
This advice is horrific for a guy who just lost 50g. $100 a day on $2k funds will take very aggressive moves that are certainly going to cause him to lose from chasing.
[deleted]
Considering they threw it away I’m going to guess it wasn’t earned or they’re a programmer fresh out.
Definitely handed to, as of last year they were looking for headphones with a $400 ""budget"".. There really are just two classes in this world
Typically people finish a 2-year college or 4-year uni at age 20 or 21-22 respectively. Work a year or two while living at home. Its possible to save that much lmao.
I think you might be best investing in a cash emergency fund before an investment fund first, for solid financial fundamentals. I would also suggest finding a job that excites you more. You are young, and have time to grow money. Wish you the best.
Dude- you’re gambling, not investing. These platforms and marketing have made people think that glamorous lifestyle is just a click away. 
Stop chasing your losses.
This is the worst advice telling him that, not everyone is going to have that type of luck. If you can’t turn 2K to 50k by years end then study on what stopped you from getting there.
when my account hit \~11-10k I switched to options but what did I expect with my poor risk management that I didn't fix. But options made it quicker..
I switched options when I got to 10k. before that I just went very heavy on tickers that had possible cataylsts some were good, some generated small profit but didn't take it which ended by me carrying the bag.. I found myself not choosing a bad trade but didn't exit when I needed to or had a stop loss
Its a raise from 39% to 43%  for people who make over a million dollars a year. Not really an everyday person kind of problem?
>Ask me how I know

How? hehehe, I'm sure I know the answer, I've made my share of mistakes and I still get very frustrated when I see my portfolio going down
Great answer. Too many people now a days are looking for the overnight path to becoming a millionaire. If you took this money and put them in solid blue chip stocks for long term say 15-30 years you would be writing the opposite post of this. Don’t worry about the money you just lost, it will come back. Just take what you did as lessons and stick to long term/less risky plays.
Am I the only person on this website who isn’t a grandma
needed to hear this myself
Thank you! I absolutely agree with you and Frank Zappa! Learning every day. :)
I don't know if it could be beyond my years but Thank you. :) I think living through a lot of hard losses in life teaches you what is really important.  And how to get up and start again.
Yeah I’ve progressively pulled out what I’ve earned so even if I lost everything, I’d still technically have taken in profit what I originally started with. That said, your idea is good. I’ll be doing that next!
Yeah I started doing something similar recently. I’m not doing day trading yet mostly swing / long term investments. I’ll buy into a position. Sell at my target. Keep 1-2 tails as investments. Then I only go into the next trade with my initial investment. I keep the long positions mostly because apparently the stocks I was picking to swing were real big winners right after I stopped trading them. 

Tesla, Twitter, Nike, nvidia and many more all exploded less than a week after I decided to sell all my positions. If I had kept just 2 or 3 Tesla stocks my profits would have doubled from the 6 months I spent swing trading it. Elon musks Tweets made me a lot of money and when he got In trouble with the sec I saw it as time to move on.
No one anticipates on just losing it all, also no one is perfect and knows the correct financial decisions to make, ESPECIALLY in the stock market

It was a lesson learned, but don’t act like people have an inherent “If 4x investment, liquidate cost basis” programmed into their risk management system
Yeah it seems weird to me that you could lose so much money like that. If I had 32k I wouldn’t use more than maybe 2.5k - 5k at a time. This is just basic risk management.
Using leverage
Do I...?
how were you trading?

did you look at charts? do any TA? how did you decide your entry points?

were you going all in on meme stocks?

did you set stop losses?
Just buy the stock man.
Fuck no. Just buy the stock lmao.
>  Should I trade

no, you should practice and study until you are confident in your PROVEN and TESTED strategy.
I think 'just money' is a perspective you develop as you get older. 

When I was in my 20s, especially my early 20s, I didn't have a lot of money, and I really wanted it. I did ok at work, didn't get married or have kids, and now (mid-late 30s), I just have extra money every month. Money gets easier to come by as you get older, it just subtly happens. And I realise, it doesn't really do that much for me. It doesn't really add much to my life. Maybe if I was materialistic, or someone that loved spending money on life experiences, I'd feel differently, but I don't. I'm thankful to have financial security, but I don't crave excess anymore.

When you are young, you have time and energy, but no money. When you're middle aged, you have money and energy, but no time. Then when you're old, you have money and time, but no energy. In the end, you'll probably say it's 'just money' too.
That's fair. For me though, and possibly for OP, I have a different perspective on finances based on how I grew up and the life path I'm on. It's more of an essential and very exhaustible resource, and the market is built to extract it from those don't know much and are sucked in at the prospect of quick returns on investments in hopes of solving a lot of life's problems. Obviously it is a story that repeats for many many people, and it's most similar to going to a casino. The difference is that in the market, you expect to make money, so when you inevitably lose it, it hurts a lot more. 

It doesn't necessarily mean any one person is stupid or a failure for losing that much, because we're all only human and stupid mistakes happen, sometimes big ones. Thankfully the knowledge exists for someone to become profitable and to redeem themselves, which is an eventual goal and a heavy weight dragged by people who have lost that much to the market.
This is a perfect example of the learning process for trading lol, I didn't know about the 60/40 tax treatment for futures. Definitely am going to see how my strategies can be applied here, thank you.
Thanks! I believe it, I've felt that sting of paying a good chunk of tuition to the market. I think what may save me for my future is trying to be humble and taking the time I need to truly learn. One day it'll pay off, doesn't seem like it can be forced. Muscling through the market just won't work. One day I'll learn how to flow with it.
Every market has its challenges and edges. Forex has high liquidity, you can trade almost all hours of the day, you have high leverage, plenty of different pairs to trade, and lots of free news info. It fits my situation the best which is why I'm planning to spend time learning how to trade it successfully. Statistically, I think forex has one of the highest failure rates, so I wouldn't say it's easier, but it may be the market that fits you best, and at the end of the day that's what you want to find.
The institute of Trading and Portfolio Management teach forex as the third tier of learning as a finance professional. My interpretation is that they see it as MORE difficult than the stock market to be consistently profitable. However, there is a different balance of fundamental and technical analysis in forex, and this suits some people better. It is certainly worth taking time to explore.
Forex and futures are considered more difficult
Sure, go ahead.
Initially, yeah, but that's part of the learning process. Literally everybody that starts off is gambling until they can define an edge, and you can't do that without paying some tuition. It's only a mistake if you never learn from it, and for me, that mistake is fuel to trade properly. Just throwing out a ""you're gambling"" at anyone who makes a mistake, admits it, and expresses a drive and a plan to improve, doesn't show much understanding of the process.
This is true, but consider also that some people (aka me) have so much debt that losing another $30k honestly doesn't make a big difference in the grand scheme of things. I would never advocate risking more than you can afford to lose, but if you can afford to play with a few thousand, and you figure out a strategy that works for you, it could really be worth it, where the gains could outpace the interest if you learn how to do well. 
The market is a path to wealth that makes it possible, theoretically, to pay it all off sooner than the projected 15, 20, 25 years, etc. I personally would rather try educating myself and at least trying to make more, because the risk of losing 10% more than I owe already is worth the potential reward of financial independence.
Lol thanks for asking but I don't make anywhere near enough money to qualify as a mentor

I was flipping houses, it was my second house. It was on the water so it was nice but the area was desired but also hard with comps. So the first house I did was under contract in 2 days and this one was very similar but took awhile to sell. I was still learning. If I didn’t try to flip it tho I probably wouldn’t have lost money. But basically after selling I had that all in cash and then the stock market crashed so it was somewhat lucky.
\-7% + -3% + -4% ..etc   That tape is hard and stop loses are too  predictable. But yes much room to improve. When Yankees lose in a streak they dont call them bad ... loses are part of my normal trading days and swings. A bad streak doesnt mean i will not be in the top a the end of the season.
I completely agree, I can't believe that advice is getting upvoted
i have a $450 account and if i make $5 a day i am happy, people rebuilding should be aiming for that 1% to 2% compounded every trading day. that is a good build.
STFU I stared with $3k funds and am able to average $50-$100 a day in multiple small trades, I’ve had losses too but I limit my daily loss to $50, if I lose $50 I stop trading for the day, I don’t chase, it’s about controlling emotions and setting your daily loss limits
lol...did you even look into it before giving your answer or are you just saying don't invest bc it's an otc......give it one year, this will be $5. It already ran from $.02-$.80s and they are closing their merger with helio lending next week. Will be bigger than humble and make a move like alpp. look at its outstanding shares and float...pretty fricken phenomenal for movement.
Sure it is, I had 5 times as much when I was 22. I'm not asking because I think it's impossible.
The fact that you are basing it solely on luck means you should give up too. 

People want to day trade but don’t want to put in the research, and the work ethic needed to be successful in ANY career. They think it’s a easy way to make good money and it truly isn’t (easy). I spend more fucking time reading and researching between 5pm-2am than my 8-5pm job requires. 

If you trade and blame a lack of success on luck, than go play the powerball instead.

-96.5% and trading based on fear goes hand in hand.
What tickers are we talking about if I may ask? Sometimes its better just to hold and average down. I know this is the daytrading subreddit but if you dont use stop losses this could sometimes be the better option.
If you still have the shares you can try covered calls to start eating that loss. Keep your head up!
True, it was the immediate impact it had. The market is looking for any kind of catalyst and it got one yesterday.
Plenty in trading, but when I was OP's age I was already in prison for ""easy money."" At least he still has his freedom :)
This is great advice. I have my ""real"" money elsewhere and that is the bulk of my net worth. Anything I trade pennies, forex or crypto with is money I can afford to lose. Gambling money, basically. Someone told me to get into Safemoon a few days ago, they had already quadrupled their money this week. I bought in at the top and I am down 50%. But this purchase was like a slot machine pull, high risk, potentially high reward.
That’s what I always do, I generally pull my starting investments and then make baselines for when to take profit. So for me I’ll have let’s say 5k to start, at 10k I’ll pull 5 back out. Then I’ll get to 10 again, go back to a baseline of 8, double again etc.

It helps me take some profit so it feels more rewarding and allows me to treat myself every once in a while with a vacation or something, while also building my portfolio. Everyone does it differently, but I like my methods
I have 3 portfolios, one is long term with holdings like apple, google, etc. companies that I know for a fact will still be around in 10 years, a swing, which is my most used, every monday I buy and set a sell target, if it doesn’t get there that week I hold onto it, but I mean to get rid of them soon. And day trading I barely use, but sometimes if something starts shooting up Ill buy and then sell it for a small quick gain. It helps me to keep track of everything having multiple portfolios
True, but, that’s why it’s important to plan for worst case scenarios. I guess it all comes down to risk tolerance.
Feels really bad when you hit that 3.999x investment and forget to pull out
Because I was an idiot and an inexperienced trader?
I've been doing about 2k trades and whittled my account down about 50% over the past few months.  Stocks are shit, gonna stick to crypto and forex now.
Care to elaborate?
Lol, ????
Didn't set stop losses thats the one thing I regret the most. I fooled my self by saying ill set a ""mental stop""
Bingo.  Purchasing stocks = investing.  Purchasing options = gambling.
well said.
> When you are young, you have time and energy, but no money. When you're middle aged, you have money and energy, but no time. Then when you're old, you have money and time, but no energy. In the end, you'll probably say it's 'just money' too.

I love that, great words, thank you.
The saying ""money only matters when you don't have any"" seems appropriate here.
Sage statement brother.
Bravo, you got it 💯
Middleaged guy here. Got almost no money to my name, but clear purpose and goals. That’s turned out to be more useful when it comes to happiness and fulfillment. Priorities change, but wanting to be happy seems universal. Older people just see the value in things that have no cost. That’s why they say money isnt important.
You're right. especially now when the market is crap it's very hard to earn back some confidence, but what you're doing with the learning I hope it'll get you back stronger, it is a must to change the mindset completely.. hope I can do that soon
Margin requirements for the normal contracts and minis are really high. You should check into the micros.
The market will always be there. And the top lesson for all of us is that the market will be there and it will outlast us. We learn many times the hard way. The classic lessons of the masters that very few actually learn. We need to think like Warren Buffett. Did warren Buffett ever day trade stocks? I don’t think so!
Yeah, its true..Thank you and good luck!
Cool.. thank you.. I'll try but not now..
Ok !
CTXR better fuckin pop soon, i bought 4500 shares at like 2.60 a couple months ago in a very rare (for me) longer term play. Getting mighty sick of looking at -40% all the time
hey, in a situation similar to op right now and looking to start swing/momentum trading instead. wondering if you had advice on finding these tickers (such as CTXR) and what metrics to look at? thanks
i am really curious what stock hurt you like that? 

and why there was no stoploss used....
Coinbase is currently fucking me in the ass. Bought at 398.
Jesus, no.
Bro don't encourage him to lose more money.
insinuating a daily return of 3.6% is insane, I swear some people in this sub are bonkers
For the gesture? Idk. At face value it sounds like good advice until you stop and think ab it.
Exactly. Under $1000 a $10 return per day would be a good average on the week.
yeah total horseshit.  If you put all 3,000 on a swing stock trade in the morning you would need that stock to increase by at least 3% on the day each day in order to make $90.
I’m not being sarcastic.. you clearly are saying start small and work your way back incrementally. Does have to be $3k you can add to your account and make it $6k. Whatever it is is what it is and there’s no changing that. But you can change your risk management and process slowly working back up.
excellent advice 72
U said the wrong answer now be downvoted
Why ARE you asking then?
Sir you are officially a retard, and not the kind that wallstreet bets praises, you are literally retarded and the fact that you’re telling people to quit makes you look like the biggest piece of shit out there.
You were slangin?
Yup exactly the stocks that do those crazy numbers in the short amount of time I tend to stay away from. I’m still in my mid 20s and have a lot of extra money to play with so just recently hired a financial advisor. Put 10k into a bunch of solid blue chip stocks a few etfs and a mutual fund for long term growth. He pretty much said we’re going to keep buying when the market corrects itself. So probably just gonna keep dumping him 5-10k at a time when it does that.
That sounds good! I’m just struggling with my strategy more than anything. Bad trade after bad trade following the total opposite (a winning streak). Struggling to self analyze what changed!!
Mans obvi had a huge risk tolerance hence why he quadrupled his money lol
No one likes an “I told you so.” Like OP isn’t feeling shitty enough already.
You learn and get better. I zero-ed out my first account too.
That you were, my friend. That you were.
So I’m being downvoted for stating the obvious, nice.

I’m not that experienced either but I know enough to know you don’t throw that much cash around at once.
FTX leverage trading. Essentially you put up collateral and are able to trade with more coins than you hold. Gains are bigger...as are the losses.
Ya I learned never to do that myself lol
You need to setup bracket orders so you have a stop loss automatically in every trade you enter.
You think op lost 50k by not gambling lol
True. But with so little capital now, and small cap are dead, it's tough af
It's all about position sizing. Only purchase options at acceptable levels of loss. Always assume your risk may be fulfilled.
They're not my words, but I don't know whose they are
Yeah it's pretty awful right now lol. Don't push yourself too hard, it's not worth doing until you feel you can manage it. Learning about this stuff takes a TON of time. I spend literally 6 hours a day average 6 days a week for months at a time, but that's because I have the spare time and motivation after giving myself time to accept my losses. I used HumbledTrader on YouTube to start my journey, and since then I've been able to figure everything else out on my own. Just my recommendation, best of luck to you.
I haven’t lost in stock (yet), except misjudging dips and panic sells every once in awhile. It still hit me hard though. 

I buy and sell a lot of real estates. There were time when I got played by realtors. For an example: I could’ve bought one property at $450K, I was the highest bidder, cash offer, with no condition. But the seller realtor said I was competing with another offer. So I countered offer by a $100K. I found out later that the other offer was significantly lower than mine and I didn’t have to offer that much. So basically that’s $100K POOF! And if you know how rental market works, $100K is a lot if you want to break even on your investment early.

My suggestion, from my own experience, is go back to where I get the money to invest in the first place. If I still have that, I can get everything back. 

Another suggestion is to look back at my unnecessary expense. Maybe I didn’t need that day-offs, vacations, dining outs, etc. Back in the days (I am a smart budget now), when I complied all of those expenses, sometime they even outweighed the loss. Well, if I was willing to lose money on things like that, I am fine with losing on calculated risk. 

Regardless of this, you are not your gain/loss. Keep that in mind. Once you get back up to green and gaining back: DO NOT ever feel like you are more than you are. If the loss doesn’t define you, gain shouldn’t either.
I was in the same mindset and was thinking of quiting day trading recently. What sparked out lately was that I'm just focusing on just one stock. I've learnt the patterns, where you know for sure it won't go down and has a bit of volatility. I got to learn how traders(mostly hedge funds) behave and manipulate and I don't look at charts anymore(though a newbie). I recorded what time algo trading begins and how you can never chase and catch that. My whole perception of this market is it's heavily manipulated, but you can swim if you know where the sharks are and in which waters you are in. I still took a 4k loss this week on a different stock, but that's a learning to me. So, if at all I give advice, try to focus on one stock. 🙏
I hope you can recover some of your funds slowly and eventually be in the green again.  But I will say, your statement of “the market is crap”  is not a good way to get started in the right direction. It’s not the market’s fault. Once you’ve done your research and have learned a lot more you’ll see that money can be made regardless if the market is going up or down. First thing I would say  is to learn to control your emotions when trading. Revenge trading, angry trading, panic selling will usually get you in trouble.  It’s happened to many of us. 
I wish you luck and much success.

Because the loss should be only temporary and it should be a multi bagger in the next 5 years and I got in at a bad time when I shouldn’t have
wait you bought in on the first day pump and dump? Also ever heard of a stop loss?
Well lol you bought highhhhh
No u
Half the people in here are trying to peddle some course or book that is complete horseshit.  Anyone with a name like ""InvestorMan"" or ""Daytrader89""
Not horse shit, I look for stocks hours before market open, usually under $10 stocks, I buy 100 shares at the right moment BEFORE MARKET OPEN and have had them go up .50 - 1.00 which translates to $50-$100 then I’m out, sometimes I lose, yeah, it’s not probable to win every trade. But I cut my loses and I don’t chase. It’s not rocket science. High volatility in the first 5 mins of market open
Gave you a down vote 👎🏾
Because god hates you
Because i won’t coddle someone? I could care less who or what anyone thinks of me. If you’re doing something wrong, and won’t learn from your mistake because you can’t help but learn from it and continue fucking yourself over.. and you won’t tell the poor bastarte to stop (Even if it’s for a short period of time to learn educate himself)... than you sir, are the enabler and the one with the shit advice. 


Nobody goes 8 rounds getting whacked in the face and wins the 9th round doing the same shit strategy they did in a boxing fight.
Stealing. I stole hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders. I wish I had done things differently in my 20's, but I didn't :) Just a word of warning, some financial advisors are vultures, their interest doesn't always align with yours.
Yeah it can be hard to figure out sometimes, but also sometimes it’s not your fault, things can look really good on paper and end up losing, every trader loses sometimes. I’ve been on a losing streak lately too, but that’s why it’s also so important to take profits sometimes. Also, if you can afford to then it’s worth holding until stuff goes back up
Quadrupled then crashed to half the original value....

Unrealized gains don’t mean anything except the dopamine rush when you check your account and don’t collect profit due to greed.
Show me your Dick, it must be swingin’ large
You’re probably being downvoted because you wrongfully assumed  that I, an inexperienced trader, had as clear a knowledge of risk management as you do?
Ah gotcha. Thanks for sharing.
My biggest advice would be to not chase the market, don't keep switching your positions to try and reflect what the market is doing. You'll lose 9/10 times and always be stuck ""catching up"". Look for sectors that are currently flying under the radar and are far undervalued. Markets are cyclical so if you're chasing popular stocks and sectors that are rising, you'll probably be left behind or holding some bags at some point.

I know options are very tempting, I've gotten my ass handed to me time and the again getting greedy with options... Don't invest in options unless you are completely fine with losing your entire investment. If you do invest in options, be smart and buy options ITM or close to being ITM. The cheap premiums are attractive on far OTM options, but it's a gamble that usually doesn't pay out. 9/10 far OTM options I pick expire worthless, and I know that risk before purchasing them. Buying deep ITM calls is a smarter option play if you think a stock is going to rise. The price of the option will rise similarly to the underlying, and there is far less risk of being stuck with a worthless option by the time expiration comes around.
So this shouldn’t be your day job. Straight up - do not gamble the rest of what you have on options. Let it slowly build now. You learned your lesson, why keep risking it? You’re young - plenty of time for money to mature at a slower pace.
Well I heard them from you so i'ma credit you. Thanks /u/dubov :D
Yea! I was hearing they would move to FDA early based on a similar company doing so after a far lower success rate
really appreciate the reply dude! i like your idea of just going thru a ton of $2-$10 stocks. bound to find something interesting... this motivated me to go out and do more research before monday! best wishes
thats fair, i kinda did that too. i am working on the ""stop watching the account"" part right now, cause nothing is moving much for me.
I thought one person was the pumper and one was the dumper. And the pumper jobs were taken.
I know, it was part of the retard training here.
Lol for a $8 stock to go up $1 it would need a 12.5% increase at market open compared to premarket. 

Again total horseshit or you are delusional.
Nice one. Nice fake flexing too broke boi. You’re clearly poor as shit and that’s why you asked lmfao dkm.
OP came asking for assistance and you’re being an asshole. Fuck off.
Wow. How?
Hope you at least enjoyed them before they locked you up. I guess after conviction they seized the money? Or what was left of them.
Yes believe me I’ve read a bunch. Luckily these are all blue chip stocks so there all ones that I believe in as well. Not just him telling me to put money down on these unheard of stocks lol
Who said anything about unrealized gains? His gains WERE realized from what I gather from the post. He just kept reinvesting the profits and losing and eventually it became the $2.6K. 

Regardless of all that, we were talking about risk tolerance... and this again proves that his was high as fuck.
After the loses I've taken the last week, I'm definitely not showing it for free.
I mean it’s common sense, so yeah I assume anyone risking thousands of dollars of hard earned cash would think about what they’re doing. I guess I was wrong.
[deleted]
I need to focus on setting stops and taking the losses for what they were... better TA is required if I hit a stop loss
[deleted]
Ok bear with me. But i imagined an old school call of duty 3 campaign intro basic training mission. You have to throw your money at the stock with the ath and its basically a grenade range. Every time you miss and make a profit you hear the little ai shitface say ""looks like you made a profit, try again."" 

You keep trying and every time that you fall short and make money he just repeats ""looks like you made a profit, try again"" in that awful 2005 script voice that makes you want to just quit the game with the 40s radio in the background.

Finally you lose it all. I mean big. And you hit the target all the way up at the ath. Then he just says ""excellent work private, lets move on to the next part of investment training... We may just make an investor out of you yet.""

Im so sorry for your loss and dont mean to be insensitive. Trying to be funny.
If it helps I’m not up in a single stock out of 13 at the moment. Portfolio is up 132% but market is rough since feb
I played $OCGN today... go look at the chart from 6:30am til about 6:55am.... tell me who’s delusional, I bought in at $6.50 (5:30am) and sold at $7.23... 100 shares... $73 gain on that play
I think you just don’t know how to day trade and you’re either jealous and/ or inexperienced 😉
In fact had I held the stock all day it peaked at $10.29 at 1:32pm... could have made more but I’m not greedy
The assistance is to put his $2k down.... walk away, breathe, come up with a better fucking strategy, and come back different than before.. and if you don’t agree, you’re the retard.
He was a banker
I did indeed. Cars, money, women, travel, clothes, restaurants, the full ride. It was fun, but the prison, not so much. I don't recommend it :)
I’ll send you 1 SafeMoon for it. Will that suffice? ;)
As of?
Sounds like you don’t know the difference between a DPO and an IPO.
Ok here’s what happened for shits and giggles : I set an “in play” alerts. Heard it while I was outside and ran back. OMG I thought I can’t believe I got in under 400. I am like really really smart. Finished my yard work and walked in the house like Scrooge McDuck. I won’t ruin the end for you but it’s not like how I was hoping.
I did some of this. I chose to use lower amounts to learn. I was great at picking stocks, just had to learn to be patient. I picked ones that are currently up 10-30%. I just got disappointed by them dropping upon purchase, and sold within a week. Finally, i just pulled out of most positions, and did a great reset. Picked some dividend stock, got a couple future growth, some value, some normalcy stocks, and a spac or two. Since then, I'm up 15% from losing 15%. So it's just a trial. I look at it three times a day now. Maybe four if I hear some news. One thing I did was look at what's firing off premarket, top of the list at 730am. Buy around 8, and sell by 10. No questions, no exceptions. Yeah I left about 30% on the table for some, but i didnt lose 40% on the others. And I can still perform my job great.
lol you just look up what stock had the largest premarket movement today?  You named a single day.  Tell me what your play is tomorrow at 6am.  I challenge you.  You are talking complete horseshit and you feel like one of those guys who sells a YouTube course or something.
lol ok 'investorguy72' who just magically found the largest premarket move of the day as an example of what you did to make money today.  I'm sure you are legit making at least 4% per day lol.
Close, it came from banks. But I didn't work there. Not trying to be overly cryptic, I just want to keep my account anonymous. It was news at the time.
“He” said she was a grandma
Burn lol
Haha. At least you kept the humor. I guess thats one of things that might help through tough times. Anyway good luck to you and to everyone else.
Pls gimme $1000 for clg fees
With a name like ""SafeMoon"", how could it go wrong?
[deleted]
I get up at 2am/3am, watch/ analyze the premarket movers, then based on how it’s moving and any related news as to why it’s moving that’s how I decide what to buy and when to buy.... so before you hit me with FUD, learn to day trade, again it’s not always a win, I lose my fair share, but I know what to look for. Some days I even deem as a non trading day if I don’t like what I see, in that case I’ll let my long term positions only work that day.
You’re right to be quiet about it and you make good points to op.

It might seem bad shit I lost 20% of my account today but at least  you have some cash, freedom and the ability to breathe
Our experiences are what forge us into who we become. I have decades to look back on the mistakes and see that there can still be success from early mistakes. The key is to learn and not make the same mistakes(which I have also done!)
It says safe, it must be safe!!!!
Sweet, thank you. Really hoping this is one of those +100% pops rather than one of those +30% pops, but i kinda doubt it will be.
::taps you on the head:: I know you do.  I know you do.
Thanks, not trying to derail, just want to help someone that feels like it can't get worse right now. I assure you it can!
You should write a book loosely based on your misadventures : )
[deleted]
Haha resorting to petty insults..smh.. learn to day trade properly and then come talk to me. 😎👍🏼
Been watching $SYPR all morning since it was in the premarket movers and had an unverified news of a contract with a deep space program, didn’t buy it because I didn’t think it would break out from the low of $3.41, it did had a nice gap up at 8:10am, now it’s floating around $4.20/$4.30, just thought you should know. it’s all about knowing where to look, sorry if I came off like a dick yesterday, all I wanted you to know is that nearly every day there are $50-$100 profitable plays with stocks under $10 😎👍🏼
Also $OCGN ran again today, I didn’t trade it though, didn’t think it would run up again, hit a low of $8.70 and is currently gapping up to $12.45
I have considered it because 5 years after I got out of prison I was dumb enough to have even more misadventures in a completely different type of crime. Yeah, some people have to REALLY learn the hard way(twice!)
Im wondering if i should just grab another 4500 shares to bring my average down to like 2.20 from 2.60
Lol posted at noon. K. I believe you hunny.
Lol the facts are still $SYPR went from a low of $3.41 at market open to a high of $5.82 within about 3 hours. 100 shares purchased at market open and sold near high point is.... wait for it.... $240..... But I’m delusional? haha yeah ok
I know and you were all over it I'm sure.
If you read one of the previous comments I said to you specifically that I DIDNT trade it, was just proving a point that there are stocks under $10 nearly every day that can be traded to make $50-$100

This is knows as “pig butchering” scam.read up on it. Report report and report. I fell for the same scam with a Chinese guy and lost 25K. He was very persuasive. I read that they were trained to do this scam. They have a whole ass script written to lure people. 
Stay safe and don’t fall for stupid recovery scams too.

Sidebprom.vip is another site they created
Why would you ever do that ?  Sigh 😞- Do not trust anyone.  If you wanna date attractive Asian women there are zillions on regular dating sites - set up real life meeting and have fun.
The same thing happened to me but it was a guy, the name of their website was eth-bit.com.
They did the same to me,  it was horrible.  Lost about 90k. That with their program turn into 130k I decided to withdraw and then they told me I needed to pay 15k to withdraw,  in less than a few minutes my account was in 0.    This has been the most frustrated and sad thing ever.    Don’t understand how can they live with that.  She was also and Asian girl. That told
Me she will help me learn about crypto .  They use a program call CBO.
You have the wallet address?
I got hit by fxplunge.com for $480. Not a lot but I was weary to begin with. Fxmarketpundit is another one. Thankfully avoided any deposits on that one. Stay safe and with reputable wallets people
I was scammed by a Chinese girl. Apparently her name is Leah Wang. Website is six-swiss.com
Another scam site is defi-cloud.co through the coinbase wallet app. They will steal your money!
Also fell for this scam. Got tricked by a user called ""Collen (flower emoji)"" on whatsapp. Got scammed $3000. Please be careful if you see any asian girls or this name. Don't use the six-swisss website.  


Their plan was flawless and genius that they need to be stopped. See, most people tend to research like I did. I searched google for ""sixswiss"" and found nothing wrong. Because the company itself is actually legit. But what I didn't realize was she gave me a fake clone site.   
this clone site is also ABOVE the legit website in the search results (except google). Google seems to have removed them from their search engine. However they still show up on page one on bing, yahoo, duck duck, etc.
Hayley Juliet living in China, investor in a golf club, beware.
I’m in the US.  But apparently the girl I was talking to was a Chinese National living in LA.
Scammer!

Do you have a name for her? I was scammed too. Maybe we can share info?
I was just scammed like this too. Random text message from a Chinese girl named ""Cindy"" living in New York. Luckily I didn't lose too much before figuring it out... Currently reporting the incident to the FBI",,,,,,
Reminiscing those good old days when BTC is on its inception period.,2621.0,https://i.redd.it/miaww1aj8d371.jpg,"Listen if you went back in time to go compete you'd still want the $500 just to go buy more bitcoin than that 25 at that time
Just to think when I moved to America, Bitcoin was created. Could’ve had a couple billion dollars if we invested, but hey, 20/20 vision
Old meme but yeah, no one has come forward so far and said they were the recipient of said bitcoins and still kept them till now
That's amazing. I wonder if those players held onto those coins.
Oh you know just a million dollar asset at the end there …
If we ever needed a better example of how the dollar is devaluing..lol…

You almost have to feel sorry for the guys that came 1st-4th.

Probably a life lesson I there somewhere..lol

Fuck Elon Musk
1st place: $500
2nd place: $250
3rd place: $150
4th place: $100
5th place: $1,000,000 redeemable in 2021
Yo somebody gone see that and freak out because they have learned they have 25 BTC sitting somewhere lmao
It’s the taking part that counts 🤪
Sheeeeeeet
Wow, you know the saying there is always a first time...well this is the first time I'd be happy to lose.
Well if the first place used the $500 to buy BTC it’s a good price... but h highly doubt it lol
I remember hearing abouy someone ordering a pizza  with btc like 200 or something
After this im not so sure that we are early adopters
Imagine hodling those 25 bitcoins, that would've paid off 30000 times more, today.
Plot twist: Lilly Allen came 8th
Amazing to see the progress. At the time it was the last prise, today...
Would’ve came 5-8th used to cumming last anyways ;) 

Just kidding I’m a virgin

The sheer mindset of this fella
With hindsight you're exactly correct, but I'd say it's likely that none of the people that got the cash prize bought bitcoin with it, whereas there's a possible chance that those that won the bitcoin may still have it.

Imagine almost becoming a millionaire if only you played a little worse.
GREAT SCOTT!!!
Genius move sir!
Yeah but then you'd have to be good enough to win lol. Damn zerg rush incoming
That is some next-level thinking. You are a true hodler, my friend.
Mad lad
That's a shark.
Mate i traveled back in time to get the btc. After reading your comment ill need to travel back again and get the 500 🤦🏻‍♂️ couldnt i read this earlier?!
20/21 vision
Not just a meme, I was involved in the Starcraft 2 scene professionally 10 years ago and I remember this tournament. There were a few tournaments that gave out BTC prizes as it was like a 'participation medal' to make sure everyone won something
Honestly there’s no way they didn’t just sell it even at like $1,000
You've lost about 15.82% of that $500's purchasing power since 2011 whereas Bitcoin has 20,000x.
Hope you do well!
It’s 10,000
BTCs actually
Unless you bought $500 worth of btc with the first place prize
Precisely
SCAAAM
Lol....

4th place would be the most epic loss
Ya, there seems to be like maybe 10-100 people in the entire world that held their Bitcoins from that era with the intention that the value would get to where it is today -- basically no one knew nor could predict. The white paper is so beautiful that I'd like to think if I found it in those days, I'd be one of the few but who am I kidding?
Oh fuck.
5 million....? How much do you think Bitcoin is worth lmao
This is why I didn’t study at school, still waiting for my big pay day.
I would’ve sold in 2017",,,,,,
